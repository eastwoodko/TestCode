1
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:26,147
l should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:40,547
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:46,027
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:51,507
l'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:54,987
-And the boy?
-Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:59,626
Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid
with something as important as this?

7
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:04,547
Ah, Professor, l would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:27,547
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:31,627
-No problems, l trust, Hagrid?
-No, sir.

10
00:02:31,827 --> 00:02:36,307
Little tyke fell asleep just
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:39,587
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:40,387 --> 00:02:42,467
There you go.

13
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:52,427
Albus.Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:52,667 --> 00:02:57,907
l've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.Imaginable.

15
00:02:58,147 --> 00:03:02,107
-They really are--
-The only family he has.

16
00:03:02,387 --> 00:03:07,700
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child
in our world who doesn't know his name.

17
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:09,267
Exactly.

18
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,747
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:18,987
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:36,467
There, there, Hagrid.
lt's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:49,827
Good luck...

22
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:52,987
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:13,547
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:17,707
Now!

25
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:34,747
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:45,947 --> 00:04:51,227
-Here he comes, the birthday boy.
-Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:56,227
Why don't you just cook the breakfast,
and try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:56,427 --> 00:05:01,387
-Yes, Aunt Petunia.
-l want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:04,547
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:09,747
-Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
-Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:14,067
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:19,747
-How many are there?
-36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:23,187
36?! But last year...last year l had 37!

34
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:27,400
-But some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year's.
-l don't care how big they are!

35
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:29,987
Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do...

36
00:05:30,187 --> 00:05:34,547
... is that when we go out, we're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:42,147
lt should be a lovely day at the zoo.
l'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:47,267
l'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:50,987
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:54,267
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:56,747
Get in.

42
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:06,347
Make it move.

43
00:06:09,027 --> 00:06:10,707
Move!

44
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,427
-Move!
-He's asleep!

45
00:06:13,627 --> 00:06:16,187
He's boring.

46
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,067
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:23,987
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there day after day...

48
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:28,347
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:33,787
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:40,347
lt's just, l've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:42,227
Do you...?

52
00:06:42,427 --> 00:06:46,547
I mean,Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:50,987
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:51,187 --> 00:06:53,467
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:56,347 --> 00:07:01,067
l see. That's me as well.
l never knew my parents either.

56
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:06,267
Mummy, Dad, come here! you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:29,387 --> 00:07:31,387
Thanks.

58
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:33,027
Anytime.

59
00:07:36,347 --> 00:07:38,267
Snake!

60
00:07:53,747 --> 00:07:57,067
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:57,347 --> 00:08:00,467
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:06,027
Who did this? How did you get
in there? ls there a snake?

63
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:16,227
lt's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:20,907
-What happened?
-l swear, l don't know!

65
00:08:21,107 --> 00:08:24,987
One minute the glass was there and
then it was gone, it was like magic.

66
00:08:29,387 --> 00:08:32,187
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:48,337
And smile!

68
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:52,737
Vernon, just look at him!
l can't believe it!

69
00:08:52,977 --> 00:08:55,417
ln just a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.

70
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:59,417
Caveat Smeltonia.
Proudest moment of my life.

71
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:02,737
Will l have to wear that too?

72
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:06,097
What? You? Go to Smeltings?

73
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:15,097
Don't be so stupid!
You're going to go to the state school.Where you belong.

74
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:18,857
This is what you'll going to be wearing,
when l finish dyeing it.

75
00:09:19,097 --> 00:09:23,417
That's Dudley's old uniform.
lt'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

76
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:25,857
It'll fit you well enough.

77
00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:29,817
Go get the post. Go!

78
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:02,417
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

79
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:05,817
-Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
-Hey, give it back! lt's mine!

80
00:10:06,017 --> 00:10:08,777
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

81
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:44,617
No more mail through this letterbox.

82
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:59,117
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

83
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:04,677
Shoo! Go on.

84
00:12:03,517 --> 00:12:06,397
Fine day, Sunday.

85
00:12:07,037 --> 00:12:11,717
ln my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

86
00:12:11,917 --> 00:12:16,357
-Because there's no post on Sundays?
-Right you are, Harry!

87
00:12:16,557 --> 00:12:19,317
No post on Sunday.

88
00:12:20,717 --> 00:12:24,637
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

89
00:12:25,237 --> 00:12:30,197
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

90
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:42,477
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--

91
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:56,197
Make it stop, please!

92
00:12:57,997 --> 00:12:59,917
Stop it!

93
00:13:04,037 --> 00:13:06,997
Mummy, what's happening?

94
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:14,757
Give me that! Give me that letter!

95
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,157
Get off!

96
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:27,077
They're my letters! Let go of me!

97
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:30,917
That's it! We're going away!

98
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:35,237
Far away, where they can't find us!

99
00:13:35,477 --> 00:13:38,717
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

100
00:14:13,637 --> 00:14:15,917
Make a wish, Harry.

101
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,077
Who's there?

102
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:48,677
Sorry about that.

103
00:14:55,557 --> 00:15:00,117
l demand that you leave at once, Sir!
You are breaking and entering!

104
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:05,837
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

105
00:15:11,037 --> 00:15:14,557
Mind, l haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

106
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:19,317
But you're a bit more along than l would have expected.
Particularly 'round the middle.

107
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:22,357
l'm not Harry.

108
00:15:24,197 --> 00:15:27,917
-l am.
-Well, of course you are.

109
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,277
Got something for you.

110
00:15:30,477 --> 00:15:36,077
Afraid l might have sat on it at somepoint, but l imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

111
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:41,997
Baked it myself, words and all.

112
00:15:47,557 --> 00:15:48,597
Thank you.

113
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:52,957
lt's not every day that your young man
turns 11 , now is it?

114
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:12,277
Excuse me, who are you?

115
00:16:12,477 --> 00:16:17,397
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

116
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:21,357
-Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
-Sorry, no.

117
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:26,877
No? Blimey, Harry, Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

118
00:16:27,117 --> 00:16:28,517
Learnt what?

119
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:31,277
You're a wizard, Harry.

120
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:34,517
-l'm a what?
-A wizard.

121
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:37,757
And a thumping good one, l'd wager,
once you're trained up little.

122
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:40,877
No, you've made a mistake.
l mean...

123
00:16:41,117 --> 00:16:44,117
...l can't be a wizard.

124
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:49,517
l mean, l'm just Harry. Just Harry.

125
00:16:50,597 --> 00:16:54,597
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

126
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:59,477
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

127
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:18,997
''Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you...

128
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:22,477
...that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.''

129
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:27,637
He will not be going there! We swore when we took him in
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

130
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:32,077
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

131
00:17:32,277 --> 00:17:35,357
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

132
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:39,277
My perfect sister being who she was.

133
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:45,477
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

134
00:17:45,677 --> 00:17:49,837
''We have a witch in the family.
lsn't it wonderful?''

135
00:17:50,037 --> 00:17:53,717
l was the only one to see her
for what she was.

136
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,677
A freak!

137
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:58,837
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

138
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:04,757
...and l knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

139
00:18:04,997 --> 00:18:09,997
And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up!
And we got landed with you.

140
00:18:10,197 --> 00:18:14,197
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

141
00:18:14,437 --> 00:18:18,757
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

142
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:22,877
-We had to say something.
-lt's an outrage! It's a scandal!

143
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:25,557
He'll not be going.

144
00:18:25,757 --> 00:18:29,077
Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's
going to stop him, are you?

145
00:18:29,237 --> 00:18:30,277
Muggle?

146
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:34,637
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down ever since he were born.

147
00:18:34,837 --> 00:18:38,717
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and...

148
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:44,837
..He'll be under the finest headmaster that
Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore.

149
00:18:45,077 --> 00:18:49,877
l will not pay to have some crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

150
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:54,597
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

151
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:56,877
...in front of me.

152
00:19:14,757 --> 00:19:19,997
Oh, um, l'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

153
00:19:20,277 --> 00:19:24,357
-Strickly speaking, l'm not allowed to do magic.
-Okay.

154
00:19:25,637 --> 00:19:28,637
Ooh, We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

155
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:38,037
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

156
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:55,947
''First year's students will require
three sets of plain work robes...

157
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:57,987
...one wand.''

158
00:19:58,227 --> 00:20:01,227
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

159
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:06,347
''One pair of dragon hide gloves.''
Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?

160
00:20:06,587 --> 00:20:09,747
They don't mean a penguin, do they?

161
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:14,987
-Crikey. l'd love a dragon.
-You'd like a dragon?

162
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:21,027
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
Vastly misunderstood.

163
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:30,387
''All students must be equipped with...

164
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:33,507
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

165
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:39,507
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad.''

166
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:42,347
Can we find all this in London?

167
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:44,947
lf you know where to go.

168
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:10,667
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, l presume?

169
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:14,747
No, thanks, Tom.
l'm on official Hogwarts business.

170
00:21:14,947 --> 00:21:18,067
Just helping young Harry here
buy his school supplies.

171
00:21:18,307 --> 00:21:21,867
Bless my soul.
lt's Harry Potter!

172
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:29,587
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

173
00:21:29,827 --> 00:21:34,147
Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
l can't believe l'm meeting you at last.

174
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:39,867
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased l am to meet you.

175
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,627
Hello, professor. l didn't see you there.

176
00:21:42,827 --> 00:21:47,827
Harry, This is Professor Quirrell.He will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

177
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:50,467
Oh, nice to meet you.

178
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:53,787
Fearfully fascinating subject.

179
00:21:53,987 --> 00:21:58,627
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

180
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:03,707
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

181
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,667
Goodbye.

182
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:11,987
-See, Harry? You're famous.
-But why am l famous, Hagrid?

183
00:22:12,187 --> 00:22:15,667
All those people back there,
how is it they know who l am?

184
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:19,667
l'm not sure l'm exactly the right person
to tell you that, Harry.

185
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:40,427
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

186
00:22:56,787 --> 00:22:59,267
Here's where you'll get your quills and your ink.

187
00:22:59,547 --> 00:23:03,467
And over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing your wizardry.

188
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,547
lt's a world-class racing broom.

189
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:34,667
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

190
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:38,187
lt's the fastest model yet.

191
00:23:41,907 --> 00:23:46,507
But, Hagrid, how am l to pay for all this?
l haven't any money.

192
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:50,067
Well there's your money, Harry.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

193
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:55,787
Tain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

194
00:24:08,427 --> 00:24:12,427
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

195
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:17,907
They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins
but not the most friendly of beasts.

196
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:20,067
Best stay close.

197
00:24:24,107 --> 00:24:27,787
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

198
00:24:31,987 --> 00:24:35,187
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

199
00:24:36,147 --> 00:24:39,347
Oh, Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

200
00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:45,027
Ha! Here's the little devil.

201
00:24:45,227 --> 00:24:48,107
Oh, and there's something else as well.

202
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:52,667
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

203
00:24:56,747 --> 00:25:01,827
lt's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

204
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:05,067
Very well.

205
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:13,107
Vault 687.

206
00:25:15,027 --> 00:25:17,347
Lamp, please.

207
00:25:25,827 --> 00:25:27,187
Key, please.

208
00:25:50,627 --> 00:25:54,387
Didn't think your mum and dad
will leave you with nothing, now did ya?

209
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:59,387
-Vault 713.
-What's in there, Hagrid?

210
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:03,747
Can't tell you, Harry.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

211
00:26:03,987 --> 00:26:05,547
Stand back.

212
00:26:33,827 --> 00:26:36,627
Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.

213
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:48,987
l still need...a wand.

214
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:52,587
A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

215
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:58,427
Why don't you run along there and wait.
l just got one more thing I gotta do. Won't be long.

216
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:18,227
Hello?

217
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:23,027
Hello?

218
00:27:26,547 --> 00:27:30,827
l wondered when
l'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

219
00:27:38,627 --> 00:27:40,867
lt seems only yesterday...

220
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:46,947
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

221
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:55,907
Here we are.

222
00:28:04,507 --> 00:28:07,027
Give it a wave.

223
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:16,067
Apparently not.

224
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,707
Perhaps...

225
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:29,507
...this.

226
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:41,187
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

227
00:28:48,427 --> 00:28:50,067
l wonder....

228
00:29:19,227 --> 00:29:21,547
Curious.

229
00:29:21,747 --> 00:29:24,667
Very curious.

230
00:29:24,867 --> 00:29:27,987
Sorry, but what's curious?

231
00:29:29,707 --> 00:29:33,027
l remember every wand
l've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

232
00:29:33,227 --> 00:29:35,987
lt so happens that the phoenix...

233
00:29:36,187 --> 00:29:40,907
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

234
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:44,387
Just one other.

235
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:48,947
lt is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

236
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:54,867
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

237
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:59,907
And who owned that wand?

238
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:03,147
We do not speak his name.

239
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:07,107
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

240
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,347
lt's not always clear why.

241
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:14,227
But l think it is clear...

242
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:18,347
...that we can expect
great things from you.

243
00:30:18,547 --> 00:30:22,787
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

244
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:25,707
...did great things.

245
00:30:25,947 --> 00:30:27,947
Terrible...

246
00:30:28,387 --> 00:30:31,667
...yes, but great.

247
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:39,307
Harry! Harry!

248
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:42,067
Happy birthday.

249
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:52,707
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

250
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:58,667
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

251
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:02,507
You know, Hagrid. l know you do.

252
00:31:06,387 --> 00:31:10,947
First, and understand this Harry
because it's very important:

253
00:31:11,147 --> 00:31:13,707
Not all wizards are good.

254
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:16,387
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

255
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:21,627
...there was a one wizard who went as bad
as he can go. His name was V--

256
00:31:21,827 --> 00:31:25,467
-His name was V--
-Maybe if you wrote it down?

257
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,547
No, l can't spell it.

258
00:31:27,747 --> 00:31:31,987
-All right, Voldemort.
-Voldemort?

259
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:38,227
lt was dark times, Harry. Dark times.

260
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:43,627
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

261
00:31:43,907 --> 00:31:47,227
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

262
00:31:48,587 --> 00:31:51,747
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

263
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:55,907
Your parents fought against him.

264
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:59,907
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

265
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:06,867
Nobody, not one.

266
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,467
Except you.

267
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:15,587
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

268
00:32:16,027 --> 00:32:20,227
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

269
00:32:20,507 --> 00:32:26,267
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.

270
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:30,107
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

271
00:32:31,227 --> 00:32:34,587
Well, some say he died.

272
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,227
Codswallop, in my opinion.

273
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:40,707
Nope, l reckon he's out there still...

274
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:43,867
...too tired to carry on.

275
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:49,507
But one thing's absolutely certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

276
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:53,987
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

277
00:32:54,467 --> 00:32:58,147
You're the boy who lived.

278
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:10,187
What are you looking at?

279
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:13,947
Blimey, is that the time?

280
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:18,147
Sorry, Harry, l'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

281
00:33:18,347 --> 00:33:23,227
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.

282
00:33:23,427 --> 00:33:28,787
Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry
that's very important. Stick to your ticket.

283
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:33,907
''Platform 9 3/4''?

284
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:38,907
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

285
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:42,467
There's no such thing, is there?

286
00:34:00,987 --> 00:34:02,587
Sorry.

287
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:06,827
Excuse me. Excuse me.

288
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:08,587
Right on your left Madam.

289
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:12,627
Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where
l might find platform 9 3/4?

290
00:34:12,827 --> 00:34:15,387
9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?

291
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:18,907
lt's the same every year,
packed with Muggles, Of course. Come on!

292
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:22,747
-Muggles?
-Platform 9 3/4, this way.

293
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:31,587
All right, Percy, you first.

294
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:42,787
Fred, you next.

295
00:34:42,987 --> 00:34:46,707
-He's not Fred, l am.
-Honestly, woman, You call yourself our mother?

296
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:48,867
Oh, l'm sorry, George.

297
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:55,427
l'm only joking. l am Fred.

298
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:03,787
Excuse me.

299
00:35:04,867 --> 00:35:07,667
Could you tell me how to...?

300
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:11,427
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

301
00:35:11,627 --> 00:35:14,107
lt's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

302
00:35:14,307 --> 00:35:20,227
All you've got do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

303
00:35:20,427 --> 00:35:23,907
-Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
-Good luck.

304
00:36:21,507 --> 00:36:25,747
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

305
00:36:25,947 --> 00:36:28,187
Not at all.

306
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:33,667
l'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

307
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:36,547
l'm Harry. Harry Potter.

308
00:36:37,947 --> 00:36:39,987
So it's true!

309
00:36:40,187 --> 00:36:42,987
l mean, do you really have the...?

310
00:36:43,547 --> 00:36:46,427
-The what?
-The scar?

311
00:36:49,627 --> 00:36:51,827
Wicked!

312
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:59,467
-Anything off the trolley, dears?
-No, thanks. l'm all set.

313
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:05,787
We'll take the lot.

314
00:37:16,507 --> 00:37:21,307
-Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
-They mean every flavor.

315
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:25,107
There's chocolate
and peppermint and there's also...

316
00:37:25,307 --> 00:37:29,147
...spinach, liver and tripe.

317
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:33,547
George sweared he got
a bogey-flavoured one once!

318
00:37:38,187 --> 00:37:43,547
-These aren't real frogs, are they?
-lt's just a spell. Besides, It's the cards you want.

319
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:49,227
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. l've got about 500 meself.

320
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:53,027
Watch it!

321
00:37:55,027 --> 00:37:58,900
Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them to begin with.

322
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:05,587
-l've got Dumbledore!
-l got about six of him.

323
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:08,907
Hey, he's gone!

324
00:38:09,107 --> 00:38:12,587
Well, you can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

325
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:16,307
This is Scabbers, by the way.
Pathetic, isn't he?

326
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:17,707
Just a little bit.

327
00:38:17,907 --> 00:38:21,227
Fred gave me a spell as
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

328
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,507
Yeah.

329
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,867
Has anyone seen a toad?

330
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:34,907
-A boy named Neville's lost one.
-No.

331
00:38:35,507 --> 00:38:39,827
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

332
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:45,227
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

333
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:48,547
Turn this stupid fat rat yellow

334
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:56,947
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

335
00:38:57,147 --> 00:39:00,427
Of course, l've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

336
00:39:00,627 --> 00:39:03,227
...but they've all worked for me.

337
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:08,907
For example:

338
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:12,067
Oculus Reparo.

339
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:16,787
That's better, isn't it?

340
00:39:17,987 --> 00:39:21,867
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

341
00:39:22,107 --> 00:39:25,667
l'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

342
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:29,587
-l'm Ron Weasley.
-Pleasure.

343
00:39:29,827 --> 00:39:34,907
You two better change into robes.
l expect we'll be arriving soon.

344
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:42,507
You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
Did you know?

345
00:39:42,707 --> 00:39:44,667
Just there.

346
00:39:56,987 --> 00:40:00,787
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

347
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:06,227
Come on, now, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

348
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:16,187
-Hello, Harry.
-Hey, Hagrid.

349
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:21,627
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on, now, follow me.

350
00:41:07,307 --> 00:41:09,107
Wicked.

351
00:41:37,267 --> 00:41:39,507
Welcome to Hogwarts.

352
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:43,747
Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

353
00:41:43,947 --> 00:41:48,987
But before you can take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

354
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:52,347
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

355
00:41:52,547 --> 00:41:56,987
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

356
00:41:57,427 --> 00:42:02,467
Now, while you're here, your house
will be like your family.

357
00:42:03,107 --> 00:42:06,587
Your triumphs will earn you points.

358
00:42:06,787 --> 00:42:10,947
Any rule-breaking,
and you will lose points.

359
00:42:11,147 --> 00:42:16,427
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points is awarded the house cup.

360
00:42:16,707 --> 00:42:17,987
Trevor!

361
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:28,547
Sorry.

362
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:32,707
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

363
00:42:34,027 --> 00:42:37,387
lt's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

364
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:40,427
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

365
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:42,027
Harry Potter?

366
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:45,347
This is Crabbe, and Goyle.

367
00:42:45,547 --> 00:42:47,827
And l'm Malfoy.

368
00:42:48,187 --> 00:42:50,507
Draco Malfoy.

369
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:56,067
Think my name's funny, do you?
l've no need to ask yours.

370
00:42:56,267 --> 00:43:02,067
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

371
00:43:02,987 --> 00:43:07,027
We'll soon find out that some wizarding families
are better than others, Potter.

372
00:43:07,227 --> 00:43:11,027
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

373
00:43:11,227 --> 00:43:13,427
l can help you there.

374
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:19,467
l think l can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

375
00:43:25,107 --> 00:43:27,307
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

376
00:43:45,907 --> 00:43:50,387
It's not real, the ceiling. lt's just bewitched
to look like the night sky.

377
00:43:50,747 --> 00:43:53,627
l read about it
in Hogwarts: A History.

378
00:44:06,867 --> 00:44:09,707
All right, will you wait along here, please?

379
00:44:11,147 --> 00:44:13,947
Now, before we begin...

380
00:44:14,147 --> 00:44:17,387
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

381
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:22,387
l have a few start-of-term notices
l wish to announce.

382
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:24,907
The first years, please note...

383
00:44:25,187 --> 00:44:31,187
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

384
00:44:31,427 --> 00:44:36,947
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

385
00:44:37,147 --> 00:44:41,787
...that the third-floor corridor on the right hand side
is out of bounds...

386
00:44:42,067 --> 00:44:46,307
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

387
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:49,627
Thank you.

388
00:44:51,387 --> 00:44:55,467
When l call your name,
you will come forth.

389
00:44:55,667 --> 00:44:59,307
l shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

390
00:44:59,507 --> 00:45:02,747
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

391
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:05,547
Hermione Granger.

392
00:45:07,827 --> 00:45:10,427
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

393
00:45:10,827 --> 00:45:14,187
Mental, that one, l'm telling you.

394
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:23,547
Ah, right then...hmm...right.

395
00:45:23,747 --> 00:45:27,347
Okay. Gryffindor!

396
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:38,947
Draco Malfoy.

397
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:45,707
Slytherin!

398
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:49,587
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad
who wasn't in Slytherin.

399
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:52,307
Susan Bones.

400
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:02,987
Harry, what is it?

401
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:05,947
Nothing. Nothing, l'm fine.

402
00:46:06,227 --> 00:46:07,627
Let's see....

403
00:46:07,867 --> 00:46:12,227
l know! Hufflepuff!

404
00:46:13,947 --> 00:46:16,387
Ronald Weasley.

405
00:46:30,227 --> 00:46:35,227
Another Weasley!
l know just what to do with you.

406
00:46:35,947 --> 00:46:38,227
Gryffindor!

407
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:46,947
Harry Potter.

408
00:47:05,027 --> 00:47:08,027
Hmm...difficult, very difficult.

409
00:47:08,227 --> 00:47:12,187
Plenty of courage, l see.
Not a bad mind, either.

410
00:47:12,387 --> 00:47:14,707
There's talent, oh, yes.

411
00:47:14,907 --> 00:47:18,747
And a thirst to prove yourself.

412
00:47:18,947 --> 00:47:21,107
But where to put you?

413
00:47:21,707 --> 00:47:24,187
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

414
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:28,067
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

415
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:33,187
You could be great, you know.
lt's all here, in your head.

416
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:38,707
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatnesses, no doubt about that.

417
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:43,667
No? Well, if you're sure.

418
00:47:43,907 --> 00:47:45,627
Better be...

419
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:47,827
...Gryffindor!

420
00:48:13,347 --> 00:48:16,147
Your attention, please.

421
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:20,867
Let the feast begin.

422
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:39,347
l'm half and half.

423
00:48:39,587 --> 00:48:42,827
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

424
00:48:43,027 --> 00:48:46,547
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

425
00:48:47,547 --> 00:48:51,347
Say, Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

426
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:54,787
Oh, thats Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

427
00:48:54,987 --> 00:48:56,907
-What's he teach?
-Potions.

428
00:48:57,147 --> 00:49:02,707
But everyone knows, its the Dark Arts he fancies.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

429
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:09,547
Hello! How are you?

430
00:49:09,827 --> 00:49:13,187
Welcome to Gryffindor.

431
00:49:23,267 --> 00:49:25,787
Look, lt's the Bloody Baron!

432
00:49:30,427 --> 00:49:33,187
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

433
00:49:33,427 --> 00:49:38,827
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

434
00:49:41,867 --> 00:49:44,787
l know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

435
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:47,747
l prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

436
00:49:47,987 --> 00:49:51,467
''Nearly'' headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

437
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:53,787
Like this.

438
00:50:03,787 --> 00:50:07,627
Gryffindors, follow me please.
Keep up. Thank you.

439
00:50:07,827 --> 00:50:12,147
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

440
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:15,747
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

441
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:20,147
Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

442
00:50:29,267 --> 00:50:35,067
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

443
00:50:35,267 --> 00:50:37,947
That picture's moving.

444
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:41,667
-Look at that one.
-l think she fancies you.

445
00:50:43,387 --> 00:50:45,747
-Oh, look! Look!
-Who's that girl?

446
00:50:45,947 --> 00:50:48,507
Welcome to Hogwarts.

447
00:51:04,507 --> 00:51:06,107
Password?

448
00:51:06,547 --> 00:51:09,347
Caput Draconis.

449
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:20,987
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

450
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:26,107
Gather around here.

451
00:51:27,827 --> 00:51:31,107
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

452
00:51:31,307 --> 00:51:35,747
Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.
Girls, the same on your right.

453
00:51:35,947 --> 00:51:39,067
You'll find that your belongings have
already been brought up.

454
00:52:47,267 --> 00:52:48,907
Made it!

455
00:52:49,107 --> 00:52:53,547
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

456
00:52:56,787 --> 00:53:01,747
-That was bloody brilliant!
-Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.

457
00:53:01,947 --> 00:53:06,267
Perhaps, lt'd be more useful if l were to transfigured
Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocket-watch.

458
00:53:06,467 --> 00:53:09,667
-That way, one of you might be on time.
-We got lost.

459
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:15,627
Then perhaps a map? l trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

460
00:53:23,827 --> 00:53:29,467
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

461
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:33,307
As such, l don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

462
00:53:33,587 --> 00:53:37,267
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

463
00:53:37,507 --> 00:53:40,587
However, for those select few...

464
00:53:41,507 --> 00:53:44,827
...who possess the predisposition...

465
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:51,787
...l can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

466
00:53:51,987 --> 00:53:54,947
...and ensnare the senses.

467
00:53:55,147 --> 00:53:57,667
l can tell you how to bottle fame...

468
00:53:57,907 --> 00:54:03,827
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

469
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:12,747
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts in ...

470
00:54:12,947 --> 00:54:18,907
...possession of abilities so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

471
00:54:19,107 --> 00:54:22,067
...to not pay attention.

472
00:54:28,027 --> 00:54:30,627
Mr. Potter.

473
00:54:31,827 --> 00:54:35,667
Our new celebrity.

474
00:54:37,827 --> 00:54:43,627
Tell me, what would l get if l added powdered root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

475
00:54:46,907 --> 00:54:49,307
You don't know? Well, let's try again.

476
00:54:49,507 --> 00:54:54,147
Where, Mr Potter, would you look
if l asked you to find me a bezoar?

477
00:54:55,427 --> 00:54:56,827
l don't know, Sir.

478
00:54:57,107 --> 00:55:00,947
And what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

479
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:05,747
l don't know, Sir.

480
00:55:06,827 --> 00:55:08,107
Pity.

481
00:55:09,827 --> 00:55:14,067
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

482
00:55:14,787 --> 00:55:16,787
...is it, Mr. Potter?

483
00:55:16,927 --> 00:55:21,807
Clearly, Hermione knows.
Seems a pity not to ask her.

484
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,127
Silence.

485
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:38,287
Put your hand down,
you silly girl!

486
00:55:41,487 --> 00:55:44,167
For your information, Potter...

487
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:49,847
...asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful
it is known as the Draught of the Living Dead.

488
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:55,407
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat
and it will save you from most poisons

489
00:55:55,687 --> 00:56:02,247
As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same
plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.

490
00:56:03,767 --> 00:56:06,007
Well...

491
00:56:06,527 --> 00:56:11,447
...why aren't you all
copying this down?

492
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:21,807
And Gryffindors...

493
00:56:22,047 --> 00:56:26,327
...note that five points will
be taken from your house...

494
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:28,847
...for your classmate's cheek.

495
00:56:46,287 --> 00:56:51,927
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

496
00:56:53,127 --> 00:56:54,687
Eye of rabbit....

497
00:56:55,007 --> 00:56:57,687
What's Seamus trying to do
to that glass of water?

498
00:56:57,927 --> 00:57:02,647
Turn it into rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before--

499
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:11,287
Mail's here.

500
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:46,527
Can l borrow this? Thanks.

501
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:52,647
Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall.

502
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:58,367
l've read about those. When the smoke turns
red, it means you've forgotten something.

503
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:02,087
The only problem is, l can't remember
what l've forgotten.

504
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,807
Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
Listen.

505
00:58:06,007 --> 00:58:09,687
''Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches unknown...

506
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:15,647
...Gringotts goblins while acknowledging
the breach, insist nothing was taken.

507
00:58:15,847 --> 00:58:21,567
The vault in question, number 713,
had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day.''

508
00:58:21,767 --> 00:58:26,047
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and l went to.

509
00:58:34,967 --> 00:58:38,687
-Good afternoon, class.
-Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

510
00:58:38,927 --> 00:58:41,727
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

511
00:58:43,007 --> 00:58:45,447
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

512
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:49,607
Well, what are you waiting for?
Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick.

513
00:58:49,807 --> 00:58:55,407
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand
over the broom and say, ''Up.''

514
00:58:55,607 --> 00:58:57,567
Up!

515
00:58:57,807 --> 00:58:58,767
Up.

516
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,087
Up.

517
00:59:03,767 --> 00:59:05,407
Up. Up!

518
00:59:05,607 --> 00:59:07,607
With feeling.

519
00:59:16,287 --> 00:59:18,407
Shut up, Harry.

520
00:59:18,647 --> 00:59:23,287
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, l want you to mount it.

521
00:59:23,487 --> 00:59:27,487
And grip it tight, you don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

522
00:59:27,887 --> 00:59:32,847
When l blow my whistle, l want each of you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

523
00:59:33,047 --> 00:59:36,887
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

524
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:41,407
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

525
00:59:41,647 --> 00:59:44,767
On my whistle. Three, two....

526
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:48,567
Mr. Longbottom.

527
00:59:53,207 --> 00:59:56,087
-Mr. Longbottom!
-Down, down!

528
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,527
Neville!

529
01:00:01,247 --> 01:00:03,927
Come back down this instant!

530
01:00:32,887 --> 01:00:35,287
Everyone out of the way!

531
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:43,007
ls he all right?

532
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:49,047
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

533
01:00:50,327 --> 01:00:55,007
Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground
while l take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.

534
01:00:55,207 --> 01:00:58,887
Understand? lf l see
a single broom in the air...

535
01:00:59,087 --> 01:01:04,367
...the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts
before they can say, Quidditch.

536
01:01:04,567 --> 01:01:06,487
Did you see his face?

537
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:10,527
Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have
remembered to fall on his fat arse.

538
01:01:10,727 --> 01:01:13,247
Give it here, Malfoy.

539
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,767
No. I think l'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

540
01:01:21,967 --> 01:01:24,407
How about on the roof?

541
01:01:25,567 --> 01:01:29,407
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

542
01:01:31,927 --> 01:01:35,767
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

543
01:01:35,967 --> 01:01:38,887
Besides, you don't even know how to fly.

544
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:41,087
What an idiot.

545
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:47,967
Give it here or l'll
knock you off your broom!

546
01:01:48,207 --> 01:01:50,327
ls that so?

547
01:01:53,447 --> 01:01:55,727
Have it your way, then.

548
01:02:28,487 --> 01:02:32,087
-Nice going, Harry.
-That was wicked, Harry!

549
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:34,367
Harry Potter!

550
01:02:35,327 --> 01:02:37,327
Follow me.

551
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:51,247
You wait here.

552
01:02:53,007 --> 01:02:58,287
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could l borrow Wood for a moment please?

553
01:02:58,527 --> 01:03:00,327
Oh, yes, of course.

554
01:03:06,007 --> 01:03:11,767
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, l have found you a Seeker.

555
01:03:13,847 --> 01:03:17,367
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

556
01:03:17,607 --> 01:03:19,807
l always knew he'd do well.

557
01:03:20,287 --> 01:03:24,327
Seeker? But first years
never make their house teams.

558
01:03:24,527 --> 01:03:29,047
-You must be the youngest Quidditch player in--
-A century, according to McGonagall.

559
01:03:29,247 --> 01:03:31,887
Hey, well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

560
01:03:32,087 --> 01:03:34,567
Fred and George are on the team too.
Beaters.

561
01:03:34,807 --> 01:03:38,487
Our job is to make sure that you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

562
01:03:38,727 --> 01:03:41,367
Can't make any promises, of course.
Rough game, Quidditch.

563
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:45,567
Brutal, But no one's died in years.
Someone will vanishes occasionally.

564
01:03:45,767 --> 01:03:48,527
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

565
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:54,407
Oh, go on Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

566
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:57,807
But l've never even played Quidditch.
What if l make a fool of myself?

567
01:03:58,247 --> 01:04:03,047
You won't make a fool of yourself.
lt's in your blood.

568
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:15,407
Harry, you never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

569
01:04:16,247 --> 01:04:18,447
l didn't know.

570
01:04:22,967 --> 01:04:27,567
l'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

571
01:04:27,767 --> 01:04:30,047
Who doesn't?

572
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:33,087
What's happening?

573
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:37,527
The staircases change, remember?

574
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:47,447
-Let's go this way.
-Before the staircase moves again.

575
01:04:55,087 --> 01:04:58,487
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

576
01:04:58,767 --> 01:05:00,887
We're not supposed to be here.

577
01:05:01,087 --> 01:05:05,007
This is the third floor.
lt's forbidden.

578
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:07,767
Let's go.

579
01:05:09,967 --> 01:05:12,847
-lt's Filch's cat!
-Run!

580
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:19,967
Quick, let's hide through that door!

581
01:05:25,127 --> 01:05:27,167
-lt's locked!
-Thats it, We're done for!

582
01:05:27,367 --> 01:05:29,527
Oh, move over!

583
01:05:30,487 --> 01:05:32,607
Alohomora.

584
01:05:33,487 --> 01:05:35,407
Get in.

585
01:05:36,647 --> 01:05:37,767
Alohomora?

586
01:05:37,967 --> 01:05:40,487
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

587
01:05:40,727 --> 01:05:44,087
Anyone here, my sweet?

588
01:05:50,327 --> 01:05:51,327
Come on.

589
01:05:52,207 --> 01:05:54,687
-Filch is gone.
-Probably thinks this door's locked.

590
01:05:54,927 --> 01:05:58,567
-lt was locked.
-And for good reason.

591
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:29,727
What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school.

592
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:33,607
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see
what it was standing on?

593
01:06:33,807 --> 01:06:37,967
l wasn't looking at its feet!
l was a bit preoccupied with its heads.

594
01:06:38,167 --> 01:06:41,047
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

595
01:06:41,287 --> 01:06:44,927
lt was standing on a trap door.
Which means it wasn't there by accident.

596
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,687
-lt's guarding something.
-Guarding something?

597
01:06:49,127 --> 01:06:52,847
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
l'm going to bed...

598
01:06:53,087 --> 01:06:56,687
...before either of you come up with another clever
idea to get us killed.

599
01:06:56,927 --> 01:07:00,047
Or worse, expelled.

600
01:07:03,287 --> 01:07:07,567
She needs to sort out her priorities.

601
01:07:12,167 --> 01:07:16,407
Quidditch is easy enough to understand.
Each team has seven players.

602
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:22,327
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

603
01:07:27,407 --> 01:07:31,527
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

604
01:07:31,727 --> 01:07:37,687
Now, the Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those three hoops.

605
01:07:37,927 --> 01:07:42,287
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

606
01:07:42,487 --> 01:07:46,967
l think so. What are those?

607
01:07:49,247 --> 01:07:51,407
You better take this.

608
01:08:01,487 --> 01:08:04,287
Careful now, it's coming back.

609
01:08:10,847 --> 01:08:14,487
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

610
01:08:31,127 --> 01:08:33,407
What was that?

611
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:37,927
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

612
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:41,647
But you are a Seeker.

613
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:49,807
The only thing l want you
to worry about is this.

614
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,567
The Golden Snitch.

615
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:55,767
-l like this ball.
-You like it now.

616
01:08:56,007 --> 01:09:00,007
Just wait. lt's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

617
01:09:00,207 --> 01:09:02,167
What do l do with it?

618
01:09:02,367 --> 01:09:05,607
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

619
01:09:05,887 --> 01:09:08,327
You catch this, the game's over.

620
01:09:08,527 --> 01:09:12,487
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

621
01:09:21,567 --> 01:09:26,887
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

622
01:09:27,087 --> 01:09:31,087
...or the ability to make objects fly.

623
01:09:31,287 --> 01:09:33,687
Do you have your feathers? Good.

624
01:09:33,927 --> 01:09:39,087
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

625
01:09:39,287 --> 01:09:42,607
The swish and flick. Everyone.

626
01:09:43,167 --> 01:09:48,807
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

627
01:09:49,487 --> 01:09:53,807
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

628
01:09:54,847 --> 01:09:57,327
Wingardium Leviosa.

629
01:09:57,607 --> 01:09:59,927
Wingardium Leviosa.

630
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:08,007
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

631
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:14,247
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
lt's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

632
01:10:14,807 --> 01:10:19,047
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

633
01:10:20,287 --> 01:10:23,367
Wingardium Leviosa.

634
01:10:30,887 --> 01:10:36,527
Oh, well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

635
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:38,367
Splendid!

636
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:42,167
Well done, dear.

637
01:10:46,407 --> 01:10:50,487
l think we're going to need
another feather over here, Professor.

638
01:10:56,967 --> 01:11:01,247
''lt's Leviosa, not Leviosar.''

639
01:11:01,487 --> 01:11:06,847
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

640
01:11:07,487 --> 01:11:10,047
l think she heard you.

641
01:11:38,687 --> 01:11:40,767
Where's Hermione?

642
01:11:41,007 --> 01:11:44,127
Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't
come out of the girl's bathroom.

643
01:11:44,327 --> 01:11:48,407
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

644
01:11:52,847 --> 01:11:56,487
Troll! In the dungeon!

645
01:11:56,767 --> 01:12:00,087
Troll in the dungeon!

646
01:12:02,887 --> 01:12:05,207
Thought you ought to know.

647
01:12:12,087 --> 01:12:14,927
Silence!

648
01:12:16,527 --> 01:12:20,567
Everyone will please not panic!

649
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,807
Now...

650
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:27,567
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

651
01:12:28,287 --> 01:12:33,087
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

652
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:47,287
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

653
01:12:47,527 --> 01:12:49,247
How could a troll get in?

654
01:12:49,487 --> 01:12:54,647
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

655
01:12:54,847 --> 01:12:58,847
-What?
-Hermione! She doesn't know.

656
01:13:10,967 --> 01:13:14,207
l think the troll's left the dungeon.

657
01:13:18,087 --> 01:13:20,247
lt's going into the girl's bathroom.

658
01:13:51,287 --> 01:13:53,647
Hermione, move!

659
01:13:57,047 --> 01:14:01,167
Help! Help!

660
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,247
Hey, pea brain!

661
01:14:17,687 --> 01:14:19,567
Help!

662
01:14:40,727 --> 01:14:43,087
Do something!

663
01:14:44,487 --> 01:14:48,487
-What?
-Anything!

664
01:14:49,087 --> 01:14:51,527
-Hurry up!
-Swish and flick.

665
01:14:51,727 --> 01:14:54,047
Wingardium Leviosa.

666
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,967
Cool.

667
01:15:31,367 --> 01:15:34,207
ls it dead?

668
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:38,367
l don't think so. Just knocked out.

669
01:15:44,607 --> 01:15:46,927
Troll bogies.

670
01:15:49,447 --> 01:15:53,007
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

671
01:15:53,207 --> 01:15:57,847
-Well, what it is--
-lt's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

672
01:16:00,007 --> 01:16:01,207
Miss Granger?

673
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:07,167
l went looking for the troll.
l'd read about them and thought l could handle it.

674
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:09,247
But l was wrong.

675
01:16:09,447 --> 01:16:14,527
lf Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, l'd probably be dead.

676
01:16:15,527 --> 01:16:19,927
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

677
01:16:20,127 --> 01:16:25,807
l would've expected more rational behavior
on your part and am very disappointed in you, Ms. Granger.

678
01:16:26,007 --> 01:16:29,007
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

679
01:16:29,247 --> 01:16:32,807
...for your serious lack of judgment.

680
01:16:33,287 --> 01:16:35,287
As for you two gentlemen...

681
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:38,927
...l just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

682
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:42,527
Not many first-year students
could take on a full grown mountain troll...

683
01:16:42,767 --> 01:16:45,367
...and live to tell the tale.

684
01:16:45,607 --> 01:16:48,047
Five points...

685
01:16:49,407 --> 01:16:52,567
...will be awarded to each of you...

686
01:16:54,127 --> 01:16:57,207
...for sheer dumb luck.

687
01:17:02,807 --> 01:17:06,567
Perhaps you ought to go.
lt might wake up.

688
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:20,277
-Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
-Mind you, we did save her life.

689
01:17:20,757 --> 01:17:25,117
Mind you, she might not have needed saving
if you hadn't insulted her.

690
01:17:25,397 --> 01:17:28,637
What are friends for?

691
01:17:30,747 --> 01:17:33,507
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

692
01:17:33,707 --> 01:17:36,907
Ron's right, Harry.
You're gonna need your strength today.

693
01:17:37,147 --> 01:17:39,347
l'm not hungry.

694
01:17:39,907 --> 01:17:45,547
Good luck today, Potter.
Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll.

695
01:17:45,747 --> 01:17:48,947
A little game of Quidditch
should be easy work for you.

696
01:17:49,147 --> 01:17:52,267
Even if it is against Slytherin.

697
01:17:59,947 --> 01:18:03,347
-That explains the blood.
-Blood?

698
01:18:03,787 --> 01:18:07,907
Listen, last night, l'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

699
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:10,787
...so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog.

700
01:18:10,987 --> 01:18:13,747
But, he got himself bitten,
that's why he's limping.

701
01:18:13,987 --> 01:18:16,227
But why would anyone go near that dog?

702
01:18:16,867 --> 01:18:20,147
The day l was at Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of one of the vaults.

703
01:18:20,347 --> 01:18:23,587
He said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

704
01:18:23,787 --> 01:18:24,907
So you're saying--

705
01:18:25,147 --> 01:18:29,627
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

706
01:18:42,787 --> 01:18:46,747
-Bit early for mail, isn't it?
-But l never get mail.

707
01:18:47,267 --> 01:18:48,827
Let's open it.

708
01:18:58,987 --> 01:19:00,267
lt's a broomstick.

709
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:05,187
That's not just a broomstick, Harry,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

710
01:19:06,627 --> 01:19:08,667
But who--?

711
01:19:30,307 --> 01:19:32,827
-Scared, Harry?
-A little.

712
01:19:33,027 --> 01:19:36,707
That's all right. l felt the same way
before my first game.

713
01:19:36,907 --> 01:19:40,427
-What happened?
-Er, l don't really remember.

714
01:19:40,707 --> 01:19:43,387
l took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

715
01:19:43,587 --> 01:19:46,427
Woke up in the hospital a week later.

716
01:20:08,627 --> 01:20:11,987
Hello! Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

717
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:16,907
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

718
01:20:47,187 --> 01:20:49,667
The players take their positions
as madam Hooch...

719
01:20:49,867 --> 01:20:53,667
...steps out onto
the field to begin the game!

720
01:20:53,867 --> 01:20:57,187
Now, l want a nice, clean game...

721
01:20:57,827 --> 01:21:00,267
...from all of you!

722
01:21:05,387 --> 01:21:08,307
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

723
01:21:08,507 --> 01:21:11,227
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

724
01:21:11,427 --> 01:21:15,227
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

725
01:21:21,347 --> 01:21:25,467
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

726
01:21:44,187 --> 01:21:48,947
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

727
01:21:54,147 --> 01:21:55,427
Well done!

728
01:21:59,827 --> 01:22:05,507
Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

729
01:22:37,547 --> 01:22:40,347
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

730
01:22:54,147 --> 01:22:56,027
Give me that!

731
01:23:27,467 --> 01:23:30,107
Take that side!

732
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:22,827
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

733
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:33,947
lt's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

734
01:24:34,187 --> 01:24:38,547
-Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
-Leave it to me.

735
01:25:00,307 --> 01:25:01,867
Come on, Hermione!

736
01:25:15,947 --> 01:25:19,707
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

737
01:25:26,787 --> 01:25:29,867
Fire! You're on fire!

738
01:25:47,707 --> 01:25:49,867
Go, go, go, go!

739
01:26:41,867 --> 01:26:44,227
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

740
01:26:45,307 --> 01:26:46,747
He's got the Snitch!

741
01:26:46,987 --> 01:26:51,067
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

742
01:26:51,267 --> 01:26:52,947
Gryffindor wins!

743
01:27:36,507 --> 01:27:40,787
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

744
01:27:40,987 --> 01:27:44,907
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

745
01:27:45,107 --> 01:27:47,547
-Who told you about Fluffy?
-Fluffy?

746
01:27:47,747 --> 01:27:51,427
-That thing has a name?
-Of course he h's got a name. He's mine.

747
01:27:51,627 --> 01:27:56,907
l bought him off an lrish feller l met down at the pub last year.
Then l lent him to Dumbledore to guard the--

748
01:27:57,107 --> 01:28:01,707
Shouldn't have said that. No more questions!
Don't ask any more questions. That's top-secret, that is.

749
01:28:02,307 --> 01:28:06,307
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

750
01:28:06,507 --> 01:28:09,987
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

751
01:28:10,467 --> 01:28:15,547
Hogwarts teacher or not, l know a spell when
l see one. l've read all about them.

752
01:28:15,787 --> 01:28:19,347
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

753
01:28:19,547 --> 01:28:21,827
Exactly.

754
01:28:22,467 --> 01:28:25,227
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

755
01:28:25,427 --> 01:28:30,107
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. lt's dangerous.

756
01:28:30,307 --> 01:28:35,427
What that dog is guarding is strictly
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

757
01:28:35,627 --> 01:28:37,027
Nicholas Flamel?

758
01:28:38,027 --> 01:28:42,747
l shouldn't have said that.
l should not have said that.

759
01:28:42,947 --> 01:28:47,067
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

760
01:28:47,267 --> 01:28:49,267
l don't know.

761
01:29:08,107 --> 01:29:10,947
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

762
01:29:11,187 --> 01:29:13,987
Ring the Hogwart bell

763
01:29:14,187 --> 01:29:16,987
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

764
01:29:17,187 --> 01:29:20,107
Cast a Christmas spell

765
01:29:33,707 --> 01:29:37,067
Knight to e5.

766
01:29:44,747 --> 01:29:46,907
Queen to e5.

767
01:29:52,547 --> 01:29:53,947
That's totally barbaric!

768
01:29:54,587 --> 01:29:58,107
That's wizard's chess.
l see you've packed.

769
01:29:58,347 --> 01:29:59,787
l see you haven't.

770
01:30:00,147 --> 01:30:05,307
Change of plans. My parents decided to go
to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie.

771
01:30:05,507 --> 01:30:09,347
-He's studying dragons there.
-Good. You can help Harry, then.

772
01:30:09,547 --> 01:30:12,907
He's going to go and look in the library
for information on Nicholas Flamel.

773
01:30:13,147 --> 01:30:16,627
We've looked a hundred times!

774
01:30:17,267 --> 01:30:22,507
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

775
01:30:24,747 --> 01:30:27,667
l think we've had
a bad influence on her.

776
01:30:30,187 --> 01:30:34,547
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

777
01:30:44,387 --> 01:30:47,707
-Happy Christmas, Harry.
-Happy Christmas, Ron.

778
01:30:47,907 --> 01:30:50,147
What are you wearing?

779
01:30:50,707 --> 01:30:54,427
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

780
01:30:55,547 --> 01:30:57,987
-l've got presents?
-Yeah.

781
01:31:05,387 --> 01:31:07,467
There they are.

782
01:31:18,507 --> 01:31:21,987
''Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

783
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:26,387
lt is time it was returned to you.
Use it well.''

784
01:31:43,187 --> 01:31:46,907
-What is it?
-Some kind of cloak.

785
01:31:47,187 --> 01:31:50,107
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

786
01:31:55,547 --> 01:31:56,827
My body's gone!

787
01:31:57,027 --> 01:32:00,627
l know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

788
01:32:01,147 --> 01:32:03,067
l'm invisible?

789
01:32:03,547 --> 01:32:07,947
They're really rare.
l wonder who gave it to you.

790
01:32:08,427 --> 01:32:13,227
There was no name.
lt just said, ''Use it well.''

791
01:32:41,267 --> 01:32:47,147
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

792
01:32:47,387 --> 01:32:53,227
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

793
01:33:12,027 --> 01:33:13,947
Who's there?

794
01:33:20,067 --> 01:33:25,707
l know you're in there.
You can't hide.

795
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:36,827
Who is it? Show yourself.

796
01:34:24,027 --> 01:34:25,387
Severus, l....

797
01:34:26,067 --> 01:34:29,947
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

798
01:34:30,147 --> 01:34:34,867
-l don't know what you mean.
-You know perfectly well what l mean.

799
01:34:52,067 --> 01:34:55,307
We'll have another little chat soon.

800
01:34:55,507 --> 01:35:00,947
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

801
01:35:01,227 --> 01:35:05,627
Professors. l found this
in the restricted section.

802
01:35:06,187 --> 01:35:11,227
lt's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

803
01:36:43,307 --> 01:36:45,147
Mum?

804
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:50,387
Dad?

805
01:37:25,147 --> 01:37:30,107
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

806
01:37:31,947 --> 01:37:34,827
Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!

807
01:37:35,027 --> 01:37:38,627
-Why?
-There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!

808
01:37:45,347 --> 01:37:49,627
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

809
01:37:51,107 --> 01:37:53,067
l only see us.

810
01:37:53,307 --> 01:37:56,627
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

811
01:37:56,867 --> 01:38:02,787
-There. You see them, don't you?
-That's me! Only l'm head boy.

812
01:38:03,267 --> 01:38:05,627
And l'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

813
01:38:05,867 --> 01:38:10,027
And bloody hell!
l'm Quidditch captain too!

814
01:38:11,147 --> 01:38:13,627
l look good.

815
01:38:14,227 --> 01:38:18,067
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

816
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:23,267
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

817
01:38:36,847 --> 01:38:39,127
Do you like yours, Ron?

818
01:38:43,087 --> 01:38:47,047
-Ron?
-l'll be right back.

819
01:38:56,887 --> 01:39:00,207
-Wanna play chess?
-No.

820
01:39:00,447 --> 01:39:04,967
-Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
-No.

821
01:39:05,167 --> 01:39:08,727
Harry, l know what you're thinking,
but don't.

822
01:39:08,927 --> 01:39:12,887
There's something not right
about that mirror.

823
01:39:39,387 --> 01:39:41,547
Back again, Harry?

824
01:39:44,667 --> 01:39:47,147
l see that you,
like so many before you...

825
01:39:47,347 --> 01:39:51,547
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

826
01:39:51,867 --> 01:39:56,027
l trust by now
you realize what it does.

827
01:39:57,347 --> 01:39:59,867
Let me give you a clue.

828
01:40:00,427 --> 01:40:02,547
The happiest man on earth...

829
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:06,147
...would look into the mirror
and see only himself...

830
01:40:06,347 --> 01:40:08,667
...exactly as he is.

831
01:40:08,867 --> 01:40:13,947
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

832
01:40:14,147 --> 01:40:16,907
Yes. And no.

833
01:40:17,947 --> 01:40:20,387
lt shows us nothing more or less...

834
01:40:20,587 --> 01:40:26,587
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

835
01:40:26,787 --> 01:40:31,507
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

836
01:40:31,707 --> 01:40:35,587
...you see them standing beside you.

837
01:40:35,787 --> 01:40:38,187
But remember this, Harry.

838
01:40:38,467 --> 01:40:44,347
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

839
01:40:44,547 --> 01:40:46,667
...or truth.

840
01:40:47,627 --> 01:40:53,667
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

841
01:40:54,707 --> 01:40:58,867
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

842
01:40:59,067 --> 01:41:00,987
And l must ask you...

843
01:41:01,947 --> 01:41:05,827
...not to go looking for it again.

844
01:41:06,587 --> 01:41:09,707
lt does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry...

845
01:41:10,267 --> 01:41:13,147
...and forget to live.

846
01:42:09,407 --> 01:42:11,487
Hi, Hedwig.

847
01:42:13,247 --> 01:42:17,127
Look at you, playing with your cards.
Pathetic!

848
01:42:17,367 --> 01:42:19,407
We've got final exams coming up soon.

849
01:42:19,687 --> 01:42:22,167
l'm ready. Ask me any question.

850
01:42:22,407 --> 01:42:26,727
Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients
in a Forgetfulness Potion?

851
01:42:26,967 --> 01:42:28,167
l forgot.

852
01:42:28,487 --> 01:42:31,407
And what, may l ask, do you plan to do
if this comes up in the final exam?

853
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,687
-Copy off you.
-No, you won't.

854
01:42:33,967 --> 01:42:39,807
Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given special
quills bewitched with an Anti-Cheating Spell.

855
01:42:40,047 --> 01:42:46,367
That's insulting! lt's as if they
don't trust us! Dumbledore again!

856
01:42:50,007 --> 01:42:54,047
-Leg-Locker Curse?
-Malfoy.

857
01:42:59,207 --> 01:43:02,287
You have got to start
standing up to people, Neville.

858
01:43:02,607 --> 01:43:06,007
How? l can barely stand at all!

859
01:43:06,287 --> 01:43:08,287
l'll do the countercurse!

860
01:43:08,607 --> 01:43:12,887
No, that's all l need!
You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!

861
01:43:13,087 --> 01:43:16,367
l don't appreciate
the insinuation, Longbottom.

862
01:43:16,647 --> 01:43:19,727
Besides, if anyone cared to notice...

863
01:43:20,007 --> 01:43:24,327
...my eyebrows have
completely grown back!

864
01:43:27,767 --> 01:43:29,927
l found him!

865
01:43:30,087 --> 01:43:35,167
''Dumbledore is particularly famous for his
defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945.''

866
01:43:35,447 --> 01:43:38,607
-Go on!
-''For the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon blood...

867
01:43:38,807 --> 01:43:41,887
...and his work on alchemy with his
partner, Nicholas Flamel'' !

868
01:43:42,127 --> 01:43:45,447
l knew the name sound familiar.
l read it on the train that day.

869
01:43:45,727 --> 01:43:48,087
Follow me!

870
01:43:51,807 --> 01:43:55,567
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

871
01:43:57,327 --> 01:44:00,647
What about the countercurse?

872
01:44:02,117 --> 01:44:07,797
l had you looking in the wrong section.
How could l be so stupid?

873
01:44:08,037 --> 01:44:11,157
l checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

874
01:44:11,357 --> 01:44:13,357
This is light?

875
01:44:17,917 --> 01:44:20,357
Of course! Here it is!

876
01:44:20,557 --> 01:44:24,557
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Sorcerer's Stone.

877
01:44:24,837 --> 01:44:25,997
The what?

878
01:44:26,637 --> 01:44:29,677
Honestly, don't you two read?

879
01:44:29,877 --> 01:44:34,357
''The Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

880
01:44:34,597 --> 01:44:37,197
lt'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

881
01:44:37,397 --> 01:44:41,437
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal.''

882
01:44:41,637 --> 01:44:43,797
-lmmortal?
-lt means you'll never die.

883
01:44:43,997 --> 01:44:46,077
l know what it means!

884
01:44:46,957 --> 01:44:51,677
''The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

885
01:44:51,877 --> 01:44:57,077
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday.''

886
01:44:58,757 --> 01:45:00,957
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.

887
01:45:01,157 --> 01:45:05,877
That's what's under the trap door.
The Sorcerer's Stone.

888
01:45:22,637 --> 01:45:26,437
Oh, hello, sorry, don't wish to be rude,
but l'm in no fit state to entertain today.

889
01:45:26,637 --> 01:45:29,357
We know about the Sorcerer's Stone.

890
01:45:34,037 --> 01:45:39,197
-We think Snape's trying to steal it.
-Snape? Blimey, you're not still on about him, are you?

891
01:45:39,397 --> 01:45:42,197
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone.
We just don't know why.

892
01:45:42,557 --> 01:45:46,990
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He's not about to steal it.

893
01:45:46,997 --> 01:45:48,077
What?

894
01:45:48,237 --> 01:45:51,850
You heard. Right. Come on, now,
l'm a bit preoccupied today.

895
01:45:51,877 --> 01:45:54,517
Wait a minute.
''One of the teachers''?

896
01:45:54,757 --> 01:45:58,637
Of course! There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

897
01:45:58,837 --> 01:46:01,437
-Spells, enchantments.
-That's right.

898
01:46:01,717 --> 01:46:04,757
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

899
01:46:04,957 --> 01:46:07,037
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

900
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:10,917
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

901
01:46:11,157 --> 01:46:14,757
l shouldn't have told you that.
l should not have told you that.

902
01:46:28,597 --> 01:46:33,677
-Hagrid, what exactly is that?
-That? lt's....

903
01:46:33,957 --> 01:46:35,957
l know what that is!

904
01:46:36,157 --> 01:46:38,797
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

905
01:46:39,157 --> 01:46:42,397
l won it. Off a stranger
l met down at the pub.

906
01:46:42,637 --> 01:46:46,717
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

907
01:47:08,957 --> 01:47:11,157
ls that...

908
01:47:11,957 --> 01:47:13,117
...a dragon?

909
01:47:13,317 --> 01:47:17,757
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

910
01:47:17,957 --> 01:47:20,837
My brother Charlie works
with these in Romania.

911
01:47:21,037 --> 01:47:25,917
lsn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

912
01:47:26,597 --> 01:47:28,317
Hello, Norbert.

913
01:47:28,677 --> 01:47:32,957
-Norbert?
-Yeah, well, He's gotta have a name, don't he?

914
01:47:33,717 --> 01:47:36,157
Don't you, Norbert?

915
01:47:43,157 --> 01:47:46,277
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

916
01:47:50,157 --> 01:47:52,237
Who's that?

917
01:47:53,957 --> 01:47:56,037
Malfoy.

918
01:47:56,797 --> 01:47:58,197
Oh, dear.

919
01:47:59,917 --> 01:48:04,717
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
He told me so the first time l met him.

920
01:48:04,917 --> 01:48:08,957
lt's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

921
01:48:09,157 --> 01:48:13,237
-l don't understand. ls that bad?
-lt's bad.

922
01:48:13,557 --> 01:48:15,717
Good evening.

923
01:48:19,357 --> 01:48:22,277
Nothing, l repeat, nothing...

924
01:48:22,517 --> 01:48:26,037
...gives a student the right
to walk about the school at night.

925
01:48:26,237 --> 01:48:31,117
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

926
01:48:31,317 --> 01:48:33,637
-50?!
-Each.

927
01:48:34,677 --> 01:48:37,077
And to ensure it doesn't happen again...

928
01:48:37,277 --> 01:48:40,597
...all four of you
will receive detention.

929
01:48:41,517 --> 01:48:44,477
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps l heard you wrong.

930
01:48:44,717 --> 01:48:47,037
l thought you said the four of us.

931
01:48:47,237 --> 01:48:49,757
No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy.

932
01:48:49,957 --> 01:48:54,957
You see, honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

933
01:48:55,437 --> 01:48:58,397
You will join your classmates
in detention.

934
01:49:09,597 --> 01:49:13,597
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

935
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:18,517
There was a time detention would find you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

936
01:49:18,717 --> 01:49:21,557
God, l miss the screaming.

937
01:49:24,117 --> 01:49:27,397
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

938
01:49:27,637 --> 01:49:32,957
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

939
01:49:35,037 --> 01:49:37,997
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

940
01:49:39,477 --> 01:49:44,477
Oh, good God, man, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

941
01:49:46,717 --> 01:49:48,797
Norbert's gone.

942
01:49:49,357 --> 01:49:52,877
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

943
01:49:53,197 --> 01:49:56,437
Well, that's good, isn't it?
He'll be with his own kind.

944
01:49:56,597 --> 01:49:58,957
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?

945
01:49:59,157 --> 01:50:03,397
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby, after all.

946
01:50:04,037 --> 01:50:09,277
Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man.
You're going into the Forest, after all.

947
01:50:09,517 --> 01:50:11,877
Got to have your wits about you.

948
01:50:12,077 --> 01:50:17,757
The Forest? l thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

949
01:50:18,197 --> 01:50:22,037
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

950
01:50:23,597 --> 01:50:24,837
...werewolves.

951
01:50:25,277 --> 01:50:28,557
There's more than werewolves
in those trees, lad.

952
01:50:28,757 --> 01:50:31,437
You can be sure of that.

953
01:50:33,397 --> 01:50:34,797
Nighty-night.

954
01:50:37,397 --> 01:50:40,237
Right. Let's go.

955
01:51:18,437 --> 01:51:20,877
Hagrid, what is that?

956
01:51:21,077 --> 01:51:24,437
What we're here for.
See that?

957
01:51:24,957 --> 01:51:30,317
That's unicorn blood, that is.
l found one dead a few weeks ago.

958
01:51:30,877 --> 01:51:35,477
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

959
01:51:42,957 --> 01:51:48,717
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

960
01:51:48,917 --> 01:51:52,077
Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

961
01:51:52,517 --> 01:51:55,797
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

962
01:51:57,077 --> 01:51:59,357
Okay. Then l get Fang.

963
01:51:59,517 --> 01:52:05,277
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

964
01:52:08,957 --> 01:52:13,957
You wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

965
01:52:14,157 --> 01:52:18,077
lf l didn't know better, Draco,
l'd say you were scared.

966
01:52:18,277 --> 01:52:20,877
l'm not scared, Potter.

967
01:52:21,997 --> 01:52:23,957
Did you hear that?

968
01:52:26,517 --> 01:52:27,917
Come on, Fang.

969
01:52:28,117 --> 01:52:29,637
Scared!

970
01:52:54,637 --> 01:52:56,797
What is it, Fang?

971
01:54:07,157 --> 01:54:12,637
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

972
01:54:12,877 --> 01:54:16,877
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

973
01:54:17,077 --> 01:54:19,837
What was that thing you saved me from?

974
01:54:20,037 --> 01:54:25,357
A monstrous creature.
lt is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

975
01:54:25,597 --> 01:54:31,117
Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep
you alive even if you are an inch from death.

976
01:54:31,357 --> 01:54:36,437
But at a terrible price. You
have slain something so pure...

977
01:54:36,637 --> 01:54:41,477
...that from the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

978
01:54:41,677 --> 01:54:43,477
A cursed life.

979
01:54:43,677 --> 01:54:47,637
-But who would choose such a life?
-Can you think of no one?

980
01:54:47,877 --> 01:54:52,837
Do you mean to say that
thing that killed the unicorn...

981
01:54:53,157 --> 01:54:57,077
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

982
01:54:57,277 --> 01:55:02,437
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

983
01:55:03,277 --> 01:55:04,837
The Sorcerer's Stone.

984
01:55:06,157 --> 01:55:08,157
Harry!

985
01:55:08,757 --> 01:55:13,277
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

986
01:55:13,477 --> 01:55:15,637
You all right there, Harry?

987
01:55:16,757 --> 01:55:21,077
Harry Potter,
this is where l leave you.

988
01:55:21,917 --> 01:55:25,757
You're safe now. Good luck.

989
01:55:33,397 --> 01:55:37,517
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

990
01:55:37,757 --> 01:55:40,517
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

991
01:55:40,757 --> 01:55:43,677
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

992
01:55:43,877 --> 01:55:48,237
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

993
01:55:48,477 --> 01:55:52,997
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

994
01:55:53,197 --> 01:55:54,797
He'll come back.

995
01:55:54,997 --> 01:55:56,757
But if he comes back...

996
01:55:56,997 --> 01:56:00,957
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

997
01:56:01,957 --> 01:56:05,517
l think if he'd had the chance,
he might have tried to kill me tonight.

998
01:56:05,717 --> 01:56:09,317
And to think, l've been worrying
about my Potions final.

999
01:56:09,517 --> 01:56:13,117
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

1000
01:56:13,477 --> 01:56:18,357
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

1001
01:56:19,117 --> 01:56:24,237
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

1002
01:56:24,437 --> 01:56:28,517
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

1003
01:56:34,237 --> 01:56:39,677
l'd always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were
frightful, but l found that rather enjoyable.

1004
01:56:39,877 --> 01:56:43,557
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

1005
01:56:43,757 --> 01:56:48,957
-My scar. lt keeps burning.
-lt's happened before.

1006
01:56:49,157 --> 01:56:51,797
-Not like this.
-Perhaps you should see the nurse.

1007
01:56:52,037 --> 01:56:55,517
l think it's a warning.
lt means danger's coming.

1008
01:57:03,157 --> 01:57:05,637
-Of course!
-What is it?

1009
01:57:05,837 --> 01:57:09,597
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

1010
01:57:09,797 --> 01:57:12,877
...and a stranger turns up who
just happens to have one?

1011
01:57:13,077 --> 01:57:15,757
I mean, how many people wander around
with dragon eggs in their pockets?

1012
01:57:15,957 --> 01:57:18,237
Why didn't l see it before?

1013
01:57:23,797 --> 01:57:27,417
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
What did he look like?

1014
01:57:27,517 --> 01:57:30,377
I don't know, l never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

1015
01:57:30,477 --> 01:57:33,077
The stranger, though, You and he
must have talked.

1016
01:57:33,637 --> 01:57:37,197
Well, he wanted to know what sort
of creatures l looked after.

1017
01:57:37,397 --> 01:57:41,397
l told him. l said, ''After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem.''

1018
01:57:41,597 --> 01:57:46,077
-And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
-Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy.

1019
01:57:46,477 --> 01:57:50,677
How often do you come across a
three-headed dog, even if you're in the trade?

1020
01:57:50,877 --> 01:57:56,517
But l told him. I said, ''The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him.''

1021
01:57:56,717 --> 01:58:02,197
Take Fluffy, for example. Just play him a bit of
music and he falls straight to sleep.

1022
01:58:03,797 --> 01:58:06,517
l shouldn't have told you that.

1023
01:58:06,757 --> 01:58:08,957
Where are you going? Wait!

1024
01:58:15,997 --> 01:58:18,717
We have to see Professor Dumbledore.
lmmediately!

1025
01:58:19,197 --> 01:58:21,837
l'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here.

1026
01:58:22,037 --> 01:58:26,717
He received an urgent owl from the
Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

1027
01:58:26,757 --> 01:58:29,477
He's gone? Now?
But this is important!

1028
01:58:29,557 --> 01:58:31,757
This is about the Sorcerer's Stone!

1029
01:58:33,677 --> 01:58:37,397
-How do you know--?
-Someone's going to try and steal it.

1030
01:58:37,997 --> 01:58:43,237
l don't know how you three found out about the stone,
but l assure you it is perfectly well protected.

1031
01:58:43,437 --> 01:58:47,717
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

1032
01:58:56,037 --> 01:58:58,837
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village.
lt was Snape.

1033
01:58:59,037 --> 01:59:01,677
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

1034
01:59:01,917 --> 01:59:05,797
-And with Dumbledore gone--
-Good afternoon.

1035
01:59:07,837 --> 01:59:11,001
Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves...

1036
01:59:11,157 --> 01:59:15,477
...be doing inside on a day like this?

1037
01:59:20,197 --> 01:59:23,757
-We were just--
-You ought to be careful.

1038
01:59:24,317 --> 01:59:26,277
People will think you're...

1039
01:59:30,557 --> 01:59:33,277
...up to something.

1040
01:59:43,557 --> 01:59:45,557
Now what do we do?

1041
01:59:45,797 --> 01:59:49,517
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

1042
02:00:03,317 --> 02:00:04,757
Trevor.

1043
02:00:05,077 --> 02:00:08,517
Trevor, shh! go! You shouldn't be here!

1044
02:00:08,757 --> 02:00:14,197
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

1045
02:00:14,397 --> 02:00:18,357
-Now, Neville, listen. We were--
-No, l won't let you!

1046
02:00:18,597 --> 02:00:23,197
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
l'll fight you.

1047
02:00:23,397 --> 02:00:27,717
Neville, l'm really really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

1048
02:00:35,677 --> 02:00:39,477
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

1049
02:00:39,717 --> 02:00:43,357
Brilliant, but scary.

1050
02:00:43,997 --> 02:00:46,037
Let's go.

1051
02:00:46,277 --> 02:00:50,517
-Sorry.
-lt's for your own good, you know.

1052
02:00:55,917 --> 02:00:59,917
-Ow! You stood on my foot!
-Sorry.

1053
02:01:03,757 --> 02:01:05,837
Alohomora.

1054
02:01:17,837 --> 02:01:20,397
Wait a minute. He's...

1055
02:01:21,637 --> 02:01:23,797
...snoring.

1056
02:01:26,317 --> 02:01:31,837
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

1057
02:01:33,437 --> 02:01:36,437
lt's got horrible breath.

1058
02:01:39,037 --> 02:01:41,117
-We have to move its paw.
-What?

1059
02:01:41,317 --> 02:01:42,717
Come on!

1060
02:01:46,797 --> 02:01:48,877
Okay. Push.

1061
02:02:11,997 --> 02:02:15,637
l'll go first. Don't follow
until l give you a sign.

1062
02:02:15,837 --> 02:02:20,837
lf something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

1063
02:02:21,637 --> 02:02:25,117
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

1064
02:02:25,797 --> 02:02:27,637
The harp.

1065
02:02:28,317 --> 02:02:31,037
lt's stopped playing.

1066
02:02:41,077 --> 02:02:42,197
Jump!

1067
02:02:56,397 --> 02:02:59,997
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1068
02:03:14,437 --> 02:03:17,517
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1069
02:03:17,757 --> 02:03:21,437
You have to relax. lf you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1070
02:03:21,677 --> 02:03:26,677
Kill us faster?
Oh, now l can relax!

1071
02:03:28,917 --> 02:03:30,237
Hermione!

1072
02:03:30,837 --> 02:03:34,637
-Now what are we gonna do?
-Just relax!

1073
02:03:34,837 --> 02:03:39,357
-Hermione, where are you?
-Do what l say! Trust me.

1074
02:03:46,437 --> 02:03:49,757
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, l'm fine.

1075
02:03:49,997 --> 02:03:53,037
-He's not relaxing, is he?
-Apparently not.

1076
02:03:53,237 --> 02:03:55,797
-We've gotta do something.
-What?

1077
02:03:55,997 --> 02:03:58,917
l remember reading something
in Herbology.

1078
02:03:59,797 --> 02:04:03,637
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
lt's deadly fun...

1079
02:04:03,837 --> 02:04:08,197
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! Devil Snare hates sunlight.

1080
02:04:08,477 --> 02:04:10,517
Lumus Solem.

1081
02:04:18,597 --> 02:04:21,197
-Ron, you okay?
-Yeah.

1082
02:04:23,877 --> 02:04:26,357
Lucky we didn't panic.

1083
02:04:27,117 --> 02:04:30,597
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1084
02:04:32,237 --> 02:04:33,717
What is that?

1085
02:04:33,957 --> 02:04:37,637
l don't know. Sounds like wings.

1086
02:04:50,797 --> 02:04:54,237
Curious. l've never seen
birds like these.

1087
02:04:54,477 --> 02:04:58,077
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1088
02:04:58,317 --> 02:05:01,757
And l'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1089
02:05:05,237 --> 02:05:09,837
-What's this all about?
-l don't know.

1090
02:05:15,717 --> 02:05:17,797
Strange.

1091
02:05:18,197 --> 02:05:20,477
Alohomora!

1092
02:05:23,437 --> 02:05:25,717
Well, it was worth a try.

1093
02:05:25,917 --> 02:05:29,157
What're we going to do?
There must be a thousand keys up there.

1094
02:05:29,357 --> 02:05:33,277
We're looking for a big old fashioned one.
Probably rusty like the handle.

1095
02:05:33,517 --> 02:05:36,917
There! l see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1096
02:05:40,517 --> 02:05:42,837
What's wrong, Harry?

1097
02:05:43,717 --> 02:05:45,237
lt's too simple.

1098
02:05:45,437 --> 02:05:50,197
Oh, go on, Harry! lf Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1099
02:05:50,397 --> 02:05:53,957
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1100
02:06:10,797 --> 02:06:13,797
This complicates things a bit.

1101
02:06:35,077 --> 02:06:36,997
Catch the key!

1102
02:06:41,397 --> 02:06:43,317
Hurry up!

1103
02:07:15,797 --> 02:07:20,477
l don't like this.
l don't like this at all.

1104
02:07:20,677 --> 02:07:23,877
Where are we? A graveyard.

1105
02:07:24,237 --> 02:07:26,877
This is no graveyard.

1106
02:07:34,357 --> 02:07:37,277
lt's a chessboard.

1107
02:07:49,277 --> 02:07:51,197
There's the door.

1108
02:08:03,237 --> 02:08:04,757
Now what do we do?

1109
02:08:05,117 --> 02:08:09,237
lt's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1110
02:08:09,837 --> 02:08:13,597
Alright. Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1111
02:08:13,917 --> 02:08:18,117
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1112
02:08:18,397 --> 02:08:22,437
As for me, l'll be a knight.

1113
02:08:29,597 --> 02:08:31,317
What happens now?

1114
02:08:32,117 --> 02:08:35,117
Well, white moves first.

1115
02:08:35,317 --> 02:08:37,197
And then...

1116
02:08:38,957 --> 02:08:40,197
...we play.

1117
02:08:50,797 --> 02:08:55,837
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1118
02:08:56,077 --> 02:08:59,637
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1119
02:08:59,997 --> 02:09:02,957
You there, d5.

1120
02:09:17,557 --> 02:09:19,157
Yes, Hermione.

1121
02:09:19,357 --> 02:09:24,437
l think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1122
02:09:30,357 --> 02:09:32,877
Castle to e4!

1123
02:09:36,477 --> 02:09:38,797
Pawn to c3!

1124
02:10:23,437 --> 02:10:27,437
-Wait a minute.
-You understand right, Harry.

1125
02:10:27,677 --> 02:10:32,397
Once l make my move,
the queen will take me.

1126
02:10:32,997 --> 02:10:35,357
Then you're free to check the king.

1127
02:10:35,557 --> 02:10:38,277
-No. Ron, no!
-What is it?

1128
02:10:38,877 --> 02:10:43,557
-He's going to sacrifice himself.
-No, you can't! there must be another way!

1129
02:10:43,757 --> 02:10:47,517
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1130
02:10:47,717 --> 02:10:51,317
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
l know it.

1131
02:10:51,837 --> 02:10:54,557
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1132
02:11:04,837 --> 02:11:07,757
Knight to h3.

1133
02:11:28,677 --> 02:11:30,677
Check.

1134
02:11:59,837 --> 02:12:01,637
Ron!

1135
02:12:01,837 --> 02:12:07,637
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1136
02:12:22,717 --> 02:12:23,997
Checkmate.

1137
02:12:43,917 --> 02:12:46,437
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1138
02:12:46,637 --> 02:12:50,517
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1139
02:12:50,717 --> 02:12:52,597
l have to go on.

1140
02:12:53,117 --> 02:12:59,037
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1141
02:12:59,237 --> 02:13:01,757
Not as good as you.

1142
02:13:02,597 --> 02:13:07,397
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1143
02:13:08,637 --> 02:13:14,237
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1144
02:13:52,317 --> 02:13:53,997
You?

1145
02:13:54,797 --> 02:13:58,637
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the--

1146
02:13:58,837 --> 02:14:01,877
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1147
02:14:02,077 --> 02:14:05,237
Next to him, who would suspect...

1148
02:14:05,437 --> 02:14:09,357
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1149
02:14:09,557 --> 02:14:14,957
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1150
02:14:15,157 --> 02:14:17,957
No, dear boy. l tried to kill you!

1151
02:14:18,437 --> 02:14:22,597
And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1152
02:14:22,837 --> 02:14:25,037
...l would have succeeded.

1153
02:14:25,237 --> 02:14:28,237
Even with Snape muttering
his little countercurse.

1154
02:14:28,437 --> 02:14:30,677
Snape was trying to save me?

1155
02:14:30,877 --> 02:14:36,197
l knew you were a danger to me right from the off.
Especially after Halloween.

1156
02:14:36,437 --> 02:14:40,677
-Then you let the troll in!
-Very good, Potter, yes.

1157
02:14:40,877 --> 02:14:43,877
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1158
02:14:44,477 --> 02:14:49,437
While everyone else was running about dungeon,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1159
02:14:50,357 --> 02:14:53,837
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1160
02:14:54,877 --> 02:15:00,117
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1161
02:15:00,317 --> 02:15:04,357
l'm never alone. Never.

1162
02:15:04,557 --> 02:15:08,677
Now, what does this mirror do?

1163
02:15:10,237 --> 02:15:12,357
l see what l desire.

1164
02:15:12,917 --> 02:15:17,357
l see myself holding the Stone.
But how do l get it?

1165
02:15:17,557 --> 02:15:19,717
Use the boy.

1166
02:15:20,517 --> 02:15:24,437
Come here, Potter! Now!

1167
02:15:36,517 --> 02:15:40,517
Tell me, what do you see?

1168
02:16:05,677 --> 02:16:08,077
What is it? What do you see?

1169
02:16:08,317 --> 02:16:13,477
l'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
l've won the house cup.

1170
02:16:13,677 --> 02:16:15,237
He lies.

1171
02:16:15,717 --> 02:16:19,437
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1172
02:16:19,637 --> 02:16:24,037
-Let me speak to him.
-Master, you are not strong enough.

1173
02:16:24,277 --> 02:16:28,277
l have strength enough for this.

1174
02:16:46,477 --> 02:16:49,357
Harry Potter...

1175
02:16:49,557 --> 02:16:51,877
...we meet again.

1176
02:16:52,117 --> 02:16:53,517
Voldemort.

1177
02:16:53,717 --> 02:16:57,677
Yes. You see what l've become?

1178
02:16:57,957 --> 02:17:01,517
See what l must do to survive?

1179
02:17:01,717 --> 02:17:05,877
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1180
02:17:06,517 --> 02:17:09,877
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1181
02:17:10,077 --> 02:17:13,757
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1182
02:17:13,957 --> 02:17:17,517
But there is something that can.

1183
02:17:17,717 --> 02:17:23,397
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1184
02:17:23,757 --> 02:17:25,317
Stop him!

1185
02:17:30,357 --> 02:17:33,117
Don't be a fool.

1186
02:17:33,597 --> 02:17:36,717
Why suffer an horrific death...

1187
02:17:36,917 --> 02:17:40,557
...when you can join me and live?

1188
02:17:40,757 --> 02:17:41,837
Never!

1189
02:17:43,877 --> 02:17:48,637
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1190
02:17:49,397 --> 02:17:52,717
Tell me, Harry...

1191
02:17:52,957 --> 02:17:56,837
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1192
02:17:57,077 --> 02:17:59,157
Together...

1193
02:17:59,357 --> 02:18:01,917
...we can bring them back.

1194
02:18:02,317 --> 02:18:07,037
All l ask is for something in return.

1195
02:18:13,757 --> 02:18:16,877
That's it, Harry.

1196
02:18:17,757 --> 02:18:21,637
There is no good and evil.

1197
02:18:21,837 --> 02:18:24,877
There is only power...

1198
02:18:25,077 --> 02:18:29,197
...and those too weak to seek it.

1199
02:18:29,877 --> 02:18:34,917
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1200
02:18:35,317 --> 02:18:37,597
Just give me the Stone!

1201
02:18:40,197 --> 02:18:41,357
You liar!

1202
02:18:41,597 --> 02:18:43,717
Kill him!

1203
02:19:07,237 --> 02:19:12,557
-What is this magic?
-Fool, get the Stone!

1204
02:20:57,837 --> 02:21:00,357
Good afternoon, Harry.

1205
02:21:02,477 --> 02:21:06,997
-Tokens from your admirers?
-Admirers?

1206
02:21:07,197 --> 02:21:13,197
What happened down in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret.

1207
02:21:13,397 --> 02:21:18,197
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1208
02:21:20,517 --> 02:21:24,157
l see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1209
02:21:24,357 --> 02:21:27,197
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1210
02:21:27,397 --> 02:21:30,437
Ron was here? ls he all right?
What about Hermione?

1211
02:21:30,637 --> 02:21:35,517
Fine. They're both just fine.

1212
02:21:36,077 --> 02:21:38,877
-What happened to the Stone?
-Relax, dear boy.

1213
02:21:39,237 --> 02:21:42,037
The Stone has been destroyed.

1214
02:21:42,317 --> 02:21:46,217
My friend Nicholas and l
have had a little chat...

1215
02:21:46,317 --> 02:21:50,677
...and agreed it was best all around.

1216
02:21:50,917 --> 02:21:54,717
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1217
02:21:56,797 --> 02:22:02,277
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1218
02:22:02,477 --> 02:22:05,717
But yes, he will die.

1219
02:22:05,917 --> 02:22:08,357
How is it l got the Stone, sir?

1220
02:22:08,597 --> 02:22:11,117
One minute l was staring
in the mirror and the next--

1221
02:22:11,317 --> 02:22:15,437
You see, only a person...

1222
02:22:15,717 --> 02:22:19,637
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1223
02:22:19,877 --> 02:22:24,437
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1224
02:22:25,397 --> 02:22:28,877
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1225
02:22:29,117 --> 02:22:34,157
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1226
02:22:35,597 --> 02:22:40,837
Does that mean, with the Stone gone that is,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1227
02:22:41,037 --> 02:22:43,357
l'm afraid...

1228
02:22:44,797 --> 02:22:48,837
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1229
02:22:49,557 --> 02:22:52,117
Harry, do you know why...

1230
02:22:52,317 --> 02:22:56,357
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1231
02:22:56,557 --> 02:23:01,197
lt was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1232
02:23:01,717 --> 02:23:04,917
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1233
02:23:05,157 --> 02:23:08,917
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1234
02:23:09,157 --> 02:23:14,077
-lt lives in your very skin.
-What is it?

1235
02:23:14,917 --> 02:23:18,637
Love, Harry. Love.

1236
02:23:26,717 --> 02:23:30,837
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1237
02:23:31,037 --> 02:23:35,717
l was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1238
02:23:35,957 --> 02:23:39,237
And since then, l'm afraid,
l've lost my liking for them.

1239
02:23:39,477 --> 02:23:42,837
But l think l could be safe...

1240
02:23:43,037 --> 02:23:45,437
...with a nice toffee.

1241
02:23:49,517 --> 02:23:51,077
Alas!

1242
02:23:51,757 --> 02:23:53,877
Earwax.

1243
02:24:09,117 --> 02:24:12,277
-All right there, Ron?
-All right. You?

1244
02:24:13,397 --> 02:24:16,117
All right. Hermione?

1245
02:24:16,797 --> 02:24:18,637
Never better.

1246
02:24:34,437 --> 02:24:36,877
Another year gone.

1247
02:24:37,637 --> 02:24:42,197
And now, as l understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1248
02:24:42,397 --> 02:24:45,037
And the points stand thus:

1249
02:24:45,237 --> 02:24:51,037
ln fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1250
02:24:52,997 --> 02:24:58,677
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1251
02:25:03,957 --> 02:25:05,757
ln second place...

1252
02:25:05,957 --> 02:25:10,757
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1253
02:25:16,437 --> 02:25:18,157
And in first place...

1254
02:25:18,477 --> 02:25:23,917
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1255
02:25:29,477 --> 02:25:31,717
Nice one, mate.

1256
02:25:35,557 --> 02:25:39,600
Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done, Slytherin.

1257
02:25:39,650 --> 02:25:44,157
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1258
02:25:44,397 --> 02:25:49,357
And l have a few last-minute points
to award.

1259
02:25:49,957 --> 02:25:55,477
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1260
02:25:55,677 --> 02:25:58,477
...while others were in grave peril...

1261
02:25:59,197 --> 02:26:01,437
...50 points.

1262
02:26:02,357 --> 02:26:03,637
Good job.

1263
02:26:11,357 --> 02:26:17,397
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1264
02:26:17,917 --> 02:26:23,157
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1265
02:26:27,797 --> 02:26:29,837
And third...

1266
02:26:30,397 --> 02:26:33,277
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1267
02:26:33,477 --> 02:26:37,757
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1268
02:26:38,357 --> 02:26:43,237
...l award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1269
02:26:51,517 --> 02:26:53,437
We're tied with Slytherin!

1270
02:26:53,677 --> 02:26:59,677
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1271
02:26:59,877 --> 02:27:03,757
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1272
02:27:03,957 --> 02:27:06,917
l award 10 points...

1273
02:27:07,117 --> 02:27:10,357
...to Neville Longbottom.

1274
02:27:23,677 --> 02:27:27,117
Assuming that my calculations
are correct l believe...

1275
02:27:27,317 --> 02:27:31,877
...that a change
of decoration is in order.

1276
02:27:36,917 --> 02:27:40,277
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1277
02:28:18,317 --> 02:28:21,677
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1278
02:28:21,877 --> 02:28:26,157
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1279
02:28:31,597 --> 02:28:34,877
-Come on, Harry.
-One minute.

1280
02:28:41,157 --> 02:28:44,877
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1281
02:28:48,117 --> 02:28:49,957
This is for you.

1282
02:29:06,717 --> 02:29:08,837
Thanks, Hagrid.

1283
02:29:14,677 --> 02:29:19,077
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1284
02:29:19,517 --> 02:29:23,957
lf that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1285
02:29:24,237 --> 02:29:26,877
...you could always threaten him...

1286
02:29:27,117 --> 02:29:29,997
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with that tail of his.

1287
02:29:30,197 --> 02:29:35,277
But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1288
02:29:35,757 --> 02:29:40,077
l do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1289
02:29:45,597 --> 02:29:48,717
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1290
02:29:48,917 --> 02:29:50,997
l'm not going home.

1291
02:29:51,197 --> 02:29:53,117
Not really.
