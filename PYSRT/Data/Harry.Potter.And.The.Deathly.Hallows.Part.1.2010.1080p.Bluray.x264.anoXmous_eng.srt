A voice...

1099
01:44:22,795 --> 01:44:25,172
your voice, Hermione...

1100
01:44:25,173 --> 01:44:26,965
coming out of it.

1101
01:44:26,966 --> 01:44:31,428
- And what exactly did I say, may I ask?
- My name.

1102
01:44:31,429 --> 01:44:34,222
Just my name.

1103
01:44:34,223 --> 01:44:38,310
Like a whisper.

1104
01:44:38,311 --> 01:44:43,311
So I took it, clicked it,
and this tiny ball of light appeared.

1105
01:44:44,776 --> 01:44:46,777
And I knew.

1106
01:44:46,778 --> 01:44:51,778
And sure enough, it floated toward me,
the ball of light...

1107
01:44:53,117 --> 01:44:58,117
went right to my Chest,
straight through me. Right here.

1108
01:44:58,498 --> 01:45:02,668
And I knew it was gonna take me
where I needed to go, so I Disapparated...

1109
01:45:02,669 --> 01:45:05,504
and came to this hillside.

1110
01:45:05,505 --> 01:45:08,548
It was dark. I had no idea where I was.

1111

that one of you would show yourself.

Well, just keep talking about that
little ball of light touching your heart...

01:45:45,795 --> 01:45:47,379
and she'll come round.

It was true. Every word.

This is gonna sound crazy...

1119
01:45:54,762 --> 01:45:59,641
but I think that's why Dumbledore
left it to me, the Deluminator.

1120
01:45:59,642 --> 01:46:04,642
I think he knew that somehow I'd need it
to find my way back, and she'd lead me.

1121
01:46:07,525 --> 01:46:10,402
Bloody hell, I just realized,
you need a wand, don't you?

1122
01:46:10,403 --> 01:46:13,196
- Yeah.
- I've got one here.

1123
01:46:13,197 --> 01:46:15,949
It's a blackthorn. Ten inches.

<i>So Death fashioned him one
from an e/der tree that stood nearby.</i>

<i>The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...</i>

It's Harry Potter.

1405
02:08:05,341 --> 02:08:10,341
He's all bright and shiny and new again,
just in time for the Dark Lord.

1406
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:12,502
Call him.

1407
02:08:17,645 --> 02:08:18,257

BELLATRIX: Stupid elf.

1413
02:08:59,103 --> 02:09:02,314
- You could've killed me.
- Dobby never meant to kill.

1414
02:09:02,315 --> 02:09:07,315
Dobby only meant to maim
or seriously injure.

How dare you take a witch's wand?

1417
02:09:12,158 --> 02:09:15,327
How dare you defy your masters?

1418
02:09:15,328 --> 02:09:18,622
Dobby has no master.

1419
02:09:18,623 --> 02:09:21,291
Dobby is a free elf.

1420
02:09:21,292 --> 02:09:26,292
And Dobby has come
to save Harry Potter and his friends.

You're all right. We're safe.

Hold on. Look, just hold on, okay?

We'll fix you.

1432

Hermione will have something.

1433
02:10:34,949 --> 02:10:38,910
In your bag. Hermione?

What is it? Help me.

Harry Potter.

1440
02:11:28,586 --> 02:11:31,213
We should close his eyes.

02:11:31,214 --> 02:11:36,214
Don't you think?

1442
02:11:38,346 --> 02:11:40,222
There.

1443
02:11:40,223 --> 02:11:45,223
Now he could be sleeping.

02:11:57,949 --> 02:12:01,076
I want to bury him.

1445

Properly. Without magic.
