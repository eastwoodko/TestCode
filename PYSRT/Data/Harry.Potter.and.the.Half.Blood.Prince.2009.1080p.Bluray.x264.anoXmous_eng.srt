I would think you would want to

get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

378

That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

379
00:33:56,199 --> 00:34:01,199
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

380
00:34:02,538 --> 00:34:04,372
It's terribly tricky to make.

381
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:06,583
And this is Amortentia...

382
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:09,920
the most powerful
love potion in the world.

383
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:14,921
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

384
00:34:15,051 --> 00:34:17,802
For example, I smell...

385
00:34:17,803 --> 00:34:22,015
freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

386
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:26,770
spearmint toothpaste.

387
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:30,398
SLUGHORN: Now, Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

388
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,399
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

389
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:40,571
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

390
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:50,961
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

00:34:50,962 --> 00:34:52,837
Oh, yes.

00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:55,590
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

393
00:34:55,591 --> 00:35:00,591
is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,848

395
00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:08,849
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

396
00:35:09,647 --> 00:35:13,441
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

397
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:18,442
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

398

At least until the effects wear off.

the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

a student manage to brew a potion...

to claim this prize.

You crush it. Don't cut it.

No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

No, really.

So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

You knew him, didn't you, sir, Tom Riddle?
You were his teacher.

Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers

When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

to becoming a first-rate wizard.

I didn't get into the Slug Club.

784

handing out towels in the loo.

- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

And what happened to you?

I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

- From Professor Dumbledore.

He asked me to give you his best,

return until term resumes.

You're sure that's what Snape said?

01:12:46,109 --> 01:12:48,569
Positive. Why?

833
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:52,240
Well, it's just you can't break

I know it sounds mad.

846
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:11,819
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

847
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,488
so he could find out
what he was up to?

848
01:14:14,489 --> 01:14:18,034
- That's not what it sounded like.
TONKS: Perhaps Harry's right, Remus.

To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

850
01:14:19,828 --> 01:14:23,497
it comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

You're blinded by hatred.

- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

01:16:12,482 --> 01:16:15,609
As for Draco Malfoy...

873

I think, from what you described...

876
01:16:23,118 --> 01:16:24,952
what you and Ron saw in summer...

877
01:16:24,953 --> 01:16:28,622
the object
that Draco is so interested in...

878
01:16:28,623 --> 01:16:31,000
is a vanishing Cabinet.

879
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:32,460
A vanishing Cabinet?

You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

882

and disappear for an hour or two.

asked you years ago in your office...

1246
01:51:26,219 --> 01:51:29,304
and I need to know what you told him.

1247
01:51:29,305 --> 01:51:33,350
Be brave, professor.

1248
01:51:33,351 --> 01:51:36,728
Be brave like my mother.

1249
01:51:36,729 --> 01:51:40,524
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1250
01:51:40,525 --> 01:51:43,819
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1251
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:48,820
Ctherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1252
01:51:59,586 --> 01:52:04,586
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1253
01:52:04,716 --> 01:52:09,716
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1254
01:52:44,756 --> 01:52:47,633
RIDDLE:
I was in the library the other night...

1255
01:52:47,634 --> 01:52:50,677
in the Restricted Section...

1256
01:52:50,678 --> 01:52:55,599
and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1257
01:52:55,600 --> 01:52:59,645
It's called, as I understand it...

1258
01:52:59,646 --> 01:53:02,814
a Horcrux.

1259
01:53:02,815 --> 01:53:05,984
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1260
01:53:05,985 --> 01:53:08,820
I came across the term while reading...

1261
01:53:08,821 --> 01:53:11,990
and I didn't fully understand it.

1262
01:53:11,991 --> 01:53:16,662
I'm not sure what you were reading, Tom, but
this is very dark stuff, very dark indeed.

1263
01:53:16,663 --> 01:53:19,331
Which is...

1264
01:53:19,332 --> 01:53:24,002
why I came to you.

1265
01:53:24,003 --> 01:53:29,003
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1266
01:53:29,801 --> 01:53:34,801
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1267
01:53:35,014 --> 01:53:39,184
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1268
01:53:39,185 --> 01:53:42,980
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1269
01:53:42,981 --> 01:53:44,273
Protected?

1270
01:53:44,274 --> 01:53:48,944
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1271
01:53:48,945 --> 01:53:53,945
In other words, you cannot die.

1272
01:53:58,538 --> 01:54:01,873
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1273
01:54:01,874 --> 01:54:05,877
SLUGHORN: I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1274
01:54:05,878 --> 01:54:07,879
Murder.

1275
01:54:07,880 --> 01:54:09,756
Yes.

1276
01:54:09,757 --> 01:54:14,757
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1277
01:54:15,555 --> 01:54:20,475
RIDDLE: Can you only split the soul once?
For instance, isn't seven...?

1278
01:54:20,476 --> 01:54:22,728
Seven?

1279
01:54:22,729 --> 01:54:27,729
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1280
01:54:28,192 --> 01:54:33,113
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1281
01:54:33,114 --> 01:54:38,114
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1282
01:54:40,913 --> 01:54:45,208
Of course, sir.

1283
01:54:45,209 --> 01:54:50,209
It'll be our little secret.

1284
01:54:56,012 --> 01:55:01,012
HARRY: Sir.

1285
01:55:12,653 --> 01:55:14,946
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1286
01:55:14,947 --> 01:55:17,783
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1287
01:55:17,784 --> 01:55:21,078
Gh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1288
01:55:21,079 --> 01:55:22,287
What are they exactly?

1289
01:55:22,288 --> 01:55:27,288
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1290
01:55:28,795 --> 01:55:31,129
A ring, for example.

1291
01:55:31,130 --> 01:55:33,924
Or a book.

1292
01:55:33,925 --> 01:55:36,802
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1293
01:55:36,803 --> 01:55:39,096
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1294
01:55:39,097 --> 01:55:41,556
in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1295
01:55:41,557 --> 01:55:43,642
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1296
01:55:43,643 --> 01:55:48,643
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1297
01:55:48,815 --> 01:55:51,191
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1298
01:55:51,192 --> 01:55:56,113
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1299
01:55:56,114 --> 01:56:00,158
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1300
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:01,493
One destroys Voldemort.

1301
01:56:01,494 --> 01:56:04,579
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1302
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:09,580
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1303
01:56:21,806 --> 01:56:26,806
leaves traces.

1304
01:56:31,482 --> 01:56:33,733
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1305
01:56:33,734 --> 01:56:36,862
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1306
01:56:36,863 --> 01:56:40,115
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1307
01:56:40,116 --> 01:56:45,116
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1308
01:56:45,746 --> 01:56:50,746
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1309
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:56,840
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1310
01:56:56,841 --> 01:56:59,634
that you take too much for granted?

1311
01:56:59,635 --> 01:57:04,635
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1312
01:57:04,849 --> 01:57:07,851
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1313
01:57:07,852 --> 01:57:12,852
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1314
01:57:32,043 --> 01:57:36,254
Oh, Harry.

1315
01:57:36,255 --> 01:57:41,255
You need a shave, my friend.

1316
01:57:41,385 --> 01:57:45,764
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1317
01:57:45,765 --> 01:57:50,765
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1318
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:54,105
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1319
01:57:54,106 --> 01:57:55,774
I'm an old man.

1320
01:57:55,775 --> 01:57:58,902
You still look the same to me, sir.

1321
01:57:58,903 --> 01:58:02,072
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1322
01:58:02,073 --> 01:58:07,073
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1323
01:58:08,037 --> 01:58:12,707
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1324
01:58:12,708 --> 01:58:16,378
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1325
01:58:16,379 --> 01:58:18,380
But there is one condition:

1326
01:58:18,381 --> 01:58:22,467
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1327
01:58:22,468 --> 01:58:24,261
Yes, sir.

1328
01:58:24,262 --> 01:58:26,972
You do understand what I'm saying?

1329
01:58:26,973 --> 01:58:29,641
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1330
01:58:29,642 --> 01:58:32,143
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1331
01:58:32,144 --> 01:58:37,144
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1332
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:44,531
Your word, Harry.

1333
01:58:44,532 --> 01:58:46,825
My word.

1334
01:58:46,826 --> 01:58:49,911
Take my arm.

1335
01:58:49,912 --> 01:58:52,998
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1336
01:58:52,999 --> 01:58:57,999
Well, being me has its privileges.

1337
01:59:43,716 --> 01:59:46,134
DUMBLEDORE: This is the place.

1338

Oh, yes.

- Sir!
- Ln order to gain passage...

1341
02:00:00,941 --> 02:00:02,525
payment must be made.

1342
02:00:02,526 --> 02:00:07,526
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1343
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:10,033
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1344
02:00:10,034 --> 02:00:15,034
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1345
02:00:34,642 --> 02:00:39,437
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1346
02:00:39,438 --> 02:00:44,438
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1347
02:00:45,361 --> 02:00:45,905
Careful.

1348
02:01:10,302 --> 02:01:12,929
There it is.

1349
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:17,930
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1350
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:42,830
If you would, Harry.

1351
02:02:26,962 --> 02:02:30,006
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1352
02:02:30,007 --> 02:02:30,551
Oh, yes.

1353
02:02:42,478 --> 02:02:44,229
It has to be drunk.

1354
02:02:44,230 --> 02:02:47,899
All of it has to be drunk.

1355
02:02:47,900 --> 02:02:51,402
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1356
02:02:51,403 --> 02:02:54,239
This potion might paralyze me.

1357
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:56,699
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1358
02:02:56,700 --> 02:03:00,245
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1359
02:03:00,246 --> 02:03:02,330
You are not to indulge these requests.

1360
02:03:02,331 --> 02:03:06,042
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1361
02:03:06,043 --> 02:03:08,962
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1362
02:03:08,963 --> 02:03:11,256
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1363
02:03:11,257 --> 02:03:16,257
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.
