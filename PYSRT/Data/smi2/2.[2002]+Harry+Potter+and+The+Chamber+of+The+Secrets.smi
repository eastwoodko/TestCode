<SYNC Start=73493><P Class=ENCC>
l can't let you out, Hedwig.
<SYNC Start=75628><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not allowed to use magic<br>outside of school.
<SYNC Start=79666><P Class=ENCC>
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon--<br>- Harry Potter!
<SYNC Start=83534><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=85405><P Class=ENCC>
Now you've done it.
<SYNC Start=86997><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=91845><P Class=ENCC>
He's in there. Vernon?
<SYNC Start=94541><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=96883><P Class=ENCC>
I'm warning you, if you can't control<br>that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
<SYNC Start=100649><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=101221><P Class=ENCC>
But she's bored.
<SYNC Start=102789><P Class=ENCC>
lf l could only let her out<br>for an hour or two.
<SYNC Start=107460><P Class=ENCC>
So you can send secret messages<br>to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
<SYNC Start=111598><P Class=ENCC>
But l haven't had any messages<br>from any of my friends.
<SYNC Start=116936><P Class=ENCC>
Not one...
<SYNC Start=119005><P Class=ENCC>
...all summer.
<SYNC Start=120573><P Class=ENCC>
Who would want to be<br>friends with you?
<SYNC Start=123804><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=126079><P Class=ENCC>
l should think you'd be<br>a little more grateful.
<SYNC Start=128681><P Class=ENCC>
We've raised you since you were a baby,<br>given you the food off our table...
<SYNC Start=132352><P Class=ENCC>
...even let you have<br>Dudley's second bedroom...
<SYNC Start=134654><P Class=ENCC>
...purely out of the goodness<br>of our hearts.
<SYNC Start=137624><P Class=ENCC>
- Not now. It's for when the Masons arrive.<br>- Which should be any minute.
<SYNC Start=143392><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=144030><P Class=ENCC>
Now, let's go over our schedule<br>once again, shall we?
<SYNC Start=147033><P Class=ENCC>
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,<br>you will be...?
<SYNC Start=149135><P Class=ENCC>
In the lounge, waiting to welcome<br>them graciously to our home.
<SYNC Start=153006><P Class=ENCC>
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?<br>- I'll be waiting to open the door.
<SYNC Start=157143><P Class=ENCC>
Excellent.
<SYNC Start=159043><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=163616><P Class=ENCC>
And you?
<SYNC Start=165447><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=166019><P Class=ENCC>
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise<br>and pretending that l don't exist.
<SYNC Start=170557><P Class=ENCC>
Too right, you will.
<SYNC Start=172458><P Class=ENCC>
With any luck, this could be the day<br>l make the biggest deal of my career...
<SYNC Start=176129><P Class=ENCC>
...and you will not mess it up.
<SYNC Start=179656><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=190777><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.
<SYNC Start=195612><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=198484><P Class=ENCC>
- Who are you?<br>- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.
<SYNC Start=203387><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=204157><P Class=ENCC>
Not to be rude or anything...
<SYNC Start=205658><P Class=ENCC>
...but this isn't a great time for me<br>to have a house-elf in my bedroom.
<SYNC Start=209796><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.
<SYNC Start=212465><P Class=ENCC>
It's just that Dobby<br>has come to tell you...
<SYNC Start=215735><P Class=ENCC>
It is difficult, sir.<br>Dobby wonders where to begin.
<SYNC Start=220773><P Class=ENCC>
- Why don't you sit down?<br>- Sit down? Sit down?
<SYNC Start=226575><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=229849><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby, I'm sorry. l didn't mean<br>to offend you or anything.
<SYNC Start=234520><P Class=ENCC>
Offend Dobby?
<SYNC Start=236856><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby has heard<br>of your greatness, sir...
<SYNC Start=239359><P Class=ENCC>
...but never has he been asked<br>to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
<SYNC Start=245059><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=245999><P Class=ENCC>
You can't have met<br>many decent wizards then.
<SYNC Start=248801><P Class=ENCC>
No, l haven't.
<SYNC Start=251404><P Class=ENCC>
That was an awful thing to say.
<SYNC Start=254168><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=254807><P Class=ENCC>
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!<br>- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.
<SYNC Start=258444><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby, please, stop.
<SYNC Start=259809><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=264317><P Class=ENCC>
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.
<SYNC Start=266945><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=268888><P Class=ENCC>
- Bad Dobby.<br>- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.
<SYNC Start=273593><P Class=ENCC>
Are you all right?
<SYNC Start=275891><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=276629><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
<SYNC Start=279666><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby almost spoke ill<br>of his family, sir.
<SYNC Start=283102><P Class=ENCC>
- Your family?<br>- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.
<SYNC Start=287206><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby is bound to serve<br>one family forever.
<SYNC Start=290376><P Class=ENCC>
lf they ever knew Dobby was here...
<SYNC Start=292936><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=294580><P Class=ENCC>
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has<br>to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.
<SYNC Start=300453><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter must not go back...
<SYNC Start=302922><P Class=ENCC>
...to Hogwarts School<br>of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.
<SYNC Start=307794><P Class=ENCC>
There is a plot, a plot to make<br>most terrible things happen.
<SYNC Start=313132><P Class=ENCC>
What terrible things?<br>Who's plotting them?
<SYNC Start=316499><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=317370><P Class=ENCC>
Can't say.
<SYNC Start=320306><P Class=ENCC>
- Okay, l understand. You can't say.<br>- Don't make me talk. l--
<SYNC Start=325972><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=327447><P Class=ENCC>
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.<br>- Bad Dobby.
<SYNC Start=330883><P Class=ENCC>
So when they arrive<br>at the ninth hole...
<SYNC Start=334944><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=337523><P Class=ENCC>
Give me the lamp.
<SYNC Start=340117><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=341828><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby, stop!
<SYNC Start=344228><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=346432><P Class=ENCC>
- Let me go.<br>- Get in there and keep quiet.
<SYNC Start=349602><P Class=ENCC>
- What the devil are you doing up here?<br>- l was just--
<SYNC Start=353840><P Class=ENCC>
You just ruined the punch line<br>of my Japanese golfer joke.
<SYNC Start=356536><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=357176><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry.
<SYNC Start=358575><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=360079><P Class=ENCC>
One more sound and you'll wish<br>you'd never been born, boy.
<SYNC Start=364317><P Class=ENCC>
- And fix that door.<br>- Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=368117><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=370390><P Class=ENCC>
See why I've got to go back?
<SYNC Start=372191><P Class=ENCC>
l don't belong here.<br>l belong in your world, at Hogwarts.
<SYNC Start=376129><P Class=ENCC>
- It's the only place I've got friends.<br>- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?
<SYNC Start=380933><P Class=ENCC>
Well, l expect they've been...
<SYNC Start=384003><P Class=ENCC>
Hang on. How do you know<br>my friends haven't been writing to me?
<SYNC Start=389142><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter mustn't<br>be angry with Dobby.
<SYNC Start=392412><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter<br>thought his friends had forgotten him...
<SYNC Start=396783><P Class=ENCC>
...Harry Potter might not want<br>to go back to school, sir.
<SYNC Start=400446><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=401287><P Class=ENCC>
- Give me those. Now.<br>- No!
<SYNC Start=406054><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=418404><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby, get back here.
<SYNC Start=421635><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=424811><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby, please, no.
<SYNC Start=428281><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter must say<br>he's not going back to school.
<SYNC Start=432819><P Class=ENCC>
l can't. Hogwarts is my home.
<SYNC Start=435253><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=435922><P Class=ENCC>
Then Dobby must do it, sir,<br>for Harry Potter's own good.
<SYNC Start=441694><P Class=ENCC>
It spread as far as the eye could see,<br>all over the floor of this building.
<SYNC Start=446899><P Class=ENCC>
One plumber said,<br>"Look at all that water."
<SYNC Start=449001><P Class=ENCC>
The second plumber said,<br>"Yes, and that's just the top of it."
<SYNC Start=451993><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=463783><P Class=ENCC>
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.<br>He's very disturbed.
<SYNC Start=468020><P Class=ENCC>
Meeting strangers upsets him.<br>That's why l kept him upstairs.
<SYNC Start=472389><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=484070><P Class=ENCC>
You're never going back to that school.
<SYNC Start=486706><P Class=ENCC>
You're never going to see those<br>freaky friends of yours again. Never!
<SYNC Start=491700><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=537957><P Class=ENCC>
Hiya, Harry.
<SYNC Start=539049><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=540092><P Class=ENCC>
Ron. Fred. George.<br>What are you all doing here?
<SYNC Start=544697><P Class=ENCC>
Rescuing you, of course.<br>Now, come on, get your trunk.
<SYNC Start=548599><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=554840><P Class=ENCC>
You better stand back.
<SYNC Start=557476><P Class=ENCC>
Let's go.
<SYNC Start=559569><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=564350><P Class=ENCC>
- What was that?<br>- What was it?
<SYNC Start=566284><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=568554><P Class=ENCC>
Potter!
<SYNC Start=570923><P Class=ENCC>
Dad, what's going on?
<SYNC Start=572584><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=575861><P Class=ENCC>
Go. Go. Go.
<SYNC Start=577063><P Class=ENCC>
Dad, hurry up.
<SYNC Start=578087><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=579932><P Class=ENCC>
- Come on.<br>- Come on, Harry, hurry up.
<SYNC Start=582162><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=584170><P Class=ENCC>
Petunia, he's escaping!
<SYNC Start=585933><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=588207><P Class=ENCC>
- I've got you, Harry.<br>- Come here!
<SYNC Start=590142><P Class=ENCC>
- Let go of me!<br>- No, boy!
<SYNC Start=592144><P Class=ENCC>
You and that bloody pigeon<br>aren't going anywhere.
<SYNC Start=595314><P Class=ENCC>
- Get off!<br>- Drive!
<SYNC Start=597116><P Class=ENCC>
- Right.<br>- Right!
<SYNC Start=599151><P Class=ENCC>
No! No! No! No!
<SYNC Start=600812><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=605224><P Class=ENCC>
Dad!
<SYNC Start=606987><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=616135><P Class=ENCC>
Damn.
<SYNC Start=617625><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=621807><P Class=ENCC>
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.
<SYNC Start=625675><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=652038><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=653835><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=656542><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, come on.
<SYNC Start=658442><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=659278><P Class=ENCC>
Okay, come on.
<SYNC Start=661439><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=669655><P Class=ENCC>
- Think it'd be all right if we had some?<br>- Yeah, Mum will never know.
<SYNC Start=673716><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=690476><P Class=ENCC>
It's not much, but it's home.
<SYNC Start=693846><P Class=ENCC>
l think it's brilliant.
<SYNC Start=696110><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=696882><P Class=ENCC>
Where have you been?
<SYNC Start=701053><P Class=ENCC>
Harry, how wonderful<br>to see you, dear.
<SYNC Start=704256><P Class=ENCC>
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.
<SYNC Start=708027><P Class=ENCC>
You could have died.<br>You could have been seen.
<SYNC Start=711019><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=711597><P Class=ENCC>
Of course, l don't<br>blame you, Harry, dear.
<SYNC Start=714400><P Class=ENCC>
They were starving him, Mum.<br>There were bars on his window.
<SYNC Start=717636><P Class=ENCC>
Well, you best hope l don't put bars<br>on your window, Ronald Weasley.
<SYNC Start=722508><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, Harry,<br>time for a spot of breakfast.
<SYNC Start=724601><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=725778><P Class=ENCC>
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.
<SYNC Start=728714><P Class=ENCC>
That's it. There we go.
<SYNC Start=732785><P Class=ENCC>
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?<br>- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.
<SYNC Start=736312><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=736889><P Class=ENCC>
Hello.
<SYNC Start=738550><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=742895><P Class=ENCC>
What did l do?
<SYNC Start=744430><P Class=ENCC>
Ginny. She's been talking about you<br>all summer. A bit annoying, really.
<SYNC Start=749235><P Class=ENCC>
- Morning, Weasleys.<br>- Morning, Dad.
<SYNC Start=751795><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=752805><P Class=ENCC>
- What a night. Nine raids. Nine!<br>- Raids?
<SYNC Start=757009><P Class=ENCC>
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,<br>in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.
<SYNC Start=761046><P Class=ENCC>
Dad loves Muggles,<br>thinks they're fascinating.
<SYNC Start=764350><P Class=ENCC>
Well, now.
<SYNC Start=766580><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=768487><P Class=ENCC>
And who are you?
<SYNC Start=769715><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=770489><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.<br>Harry Potter.
<SYNC Start=774460><P Class=ENCC>
Good Lord. Are you really?
<SYNC Start=777327><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=777897><P Class=ENCC>
Well, Ron has told us all about you,<br>of course. When did he get here?
<SYNC Start=782368><P Class=ENCC>
This morning.
<SYNC Start=784270><P Class=ENCC>
Your sons flew that enchanted car<br>of yours to Surrey and back last night.
<SYNC Start=789408><P Class=ENCC>
Did you really? How did it go?
<SYNC Start=793012><P Class=ENCC>
l mean--  That was very wrong<br>indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.
<SYNC Start=797847><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=799185><P Class=ENCC>
Now, Harry, you must know<br>all about Muggles.
<SYNC Start=803222><P Class=ENCC>
Tell me, what exactly<br>is the function of a rubber duck?
<SYNC Start=807318><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=811897><P Class=ENCC>
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.
<SYNC Start=814627><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=820406><P Class=ENCC>
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?
<SYNC Start=823542><P Class=ENCC>
- Errol.<br>- He's always doing that.
<SYNC Start=826773><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=828414><P Class=ENCC>
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.<br>They've sent us Harry's as well.
<SYNC Start=832551><P Class=ENCC>
Dumbledore must know you're here.<br>Doesn't miss a trick, that man.
<SYNC Start=835788><P Class=ENCC>
- No.<br>- This lot won't come cheap.
<SYNC Start=837890><P Class=ENCC>
- The spell books alone are very expensive.<br>- We'll manage.
<SYNC Start=842156><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=842895><P Class=ENCC>
There's only one place we're going to<br>get all of this. Diagon Alley.
<SYNC Start=847161><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=848400><P Class=ENCC>
Right.
<SYNC Start=849969><P Class=ENCC>
Here we are, Harry.<br>You go first, dear.
<SYNC Start=852238><P Class=ENCC>
But Harry's never traveled<br>by Floo powder before, Mum.
<SYNC Start=855407><P Class=ENCC>
Floo powder?
<SYNC Start=856609><P Class=ENCC>
You go first, Ron, so that Harry<br>can see how it's done. Yes.
<SYNC Start=860875><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=861513><P Class=ENCC>
In you go.
<SYNC Start=863378><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=863949><P Class=ENCC>
That's it.
<SYNC Start=865439><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=868954><P Class=ENCC>
Diagon Alley.
<SYNC Start=870649><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=876695><P Class=ENCC>
You see? It's quite easy, dear.<br>Don't be afraid. Come on.
<SYNC Start=880187><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=881934><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=883335><P Class=ENCC>
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.
<SYNC Start=886739><P Class=ENCC>
That's right.<br>Now, take your Floo powder.
<SYNC Start=890140><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=891710><P Class=ENCC>
That's it, very good.
<SYNC Start=894313><P Class=ENCC>
Now, don't forget to speak<br>very, very clearly.
<SYNC Start=898682><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=900419><P Class=ENCC>
Diagonally.
<SYNC Start=902819><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=909295><P Class=ENCC>
- What did he say, dear?<br>- Diagonally.
<SYNC Start=911864><P Class=ENCC>
l thought he did.
<SYNC Start=912922><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=997983><P Class=ENCC>
- Not lost, are you, my dear?<br>- I'm fine, thank you. l was just going...
<SYNC Start=1004456><P Class=ENCC>
Come with us. We'll help you<br>find your way back.
<SYNC Start=1008950><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1009495><P Class=ENCC>
- No. Please--<br>- Harry?
<SYNC Start=1011997><P Class=ENCC>
Hagrid!
<SYNC Start=1013232><P Class=ENCC>
What do you think<br>you're doing down here? Come on.
<SYNC Start=1016258><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1022007><P Class=ENCC>
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around<br>Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.
<SYNC Start=1027446><P Class=ENCC>
Don't want no one to see you there.<br>People will think you're up to no good.
<SYNC Start=1031617><P Class=ENCC>
l was lost, l--
<SYNC Start=1034019><P Class=ENCC>
Hang on. What were you<br>doing down there then?
<SYNC Start=1037156><P Class=ENCC>
Me? l was... l was looking<br>for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
<SYNC Start=1042461><P Class=ENCC>
They're ruining all the school cabbages.
<SYNC Start=1045362><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1050803><P Class=ENCC>
Harry. Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=1053205><P Class=ENCC>
Hello, Hermione.
<SYNC Start=1054973><P Class=ENCC>
- It's so good to see you.<br>- It's great to see you too.
<SYNC Start=1057601><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1058277><P Class=ENCC>
What did you do to your glasses?
<SYNC Start=1061046><P Class=ENCC>
Oculus Reparo,
<SYNC Start=1063913><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1067386><P Class=ENCC>
l definitely need to remember that one.
<SYNC Start=1070289><P Class=ENCC>
You'll be all right now then, Harry?<br>Right. I'll leave you to it.
<SYNC Start=1074193><P Class=ENCC>
- Okay, bye.<br>- Thank you. Bye.
<SYNC Start=1075928><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, everyone's been so worried.
<SYNC Start=1077793><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1088507><P Class=ENCC>
Harry.
<SYNC Start=1089775><P Class=ENCC>
Thank goodness. We'd hoped<br>you'd only gone one grate too far.
<SYNC Start=1093178><P Class=ENCC>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br>Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.
<SYNC Start=1096181><P Class=ENCC>
Here he is.
<SYNC Start=1098445><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1102454><P Class=ENCC>
Mum fancies him.
<SYNC Start=1104256><P Class=ENCC>
Make way there, please.<br>Let me by, madam. Thank you.
<SYNC Start=1107693><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me, little girl.<br>This is for the Daily Prophet.
<SYNC Start=1111129><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1115334><P Class=ENCC>
It can't be. Harry Potter?
<SYNC Start=1118201><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1119771><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter!
<SYNC Start=1121807><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me, madam.
<SYNC Start=1122967><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1125010><P Class=ENCC>
Nice big smile, Harry.<br>Together, you and l rate the front page.
<SYNC Start=1129047><P Class=ENCC>
Ladies and gentlemen,<br>what an extraordinary moment this is.
<SYNC Start=1132618><P Class=ENCC>
When young Harry stepped<br>into Flourish and Blotts this morning...
<SYNC Start=1135954><P Class=ENCC>
...to purchase my autobiography,<br>Magical Me...
<SYNC Start=1140015><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1143495><P Class=ENCC>
...which, incidentally,<br>is currently celebrating...
<SYNC Start=1146565><P Class=ENCC>
...its 27th week atop<br>the Daily Prophet bestseller list...
<SYNC Start=1151570><P Class=ENCC>
...he had no idea that he would,<br>in fact, be leaving...
<SYNC Start=1156030><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1157242><P Class=ENCC>
...with my entire collected works...
<SYNC Start=1162145><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1162748><P Class=ENCC>
...free of charge.
<SYNC Start=1164943><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1167119><P Class=ENCC>
Now, ladies?
<SYNC Start=1169621><P Class=ENCC>
Harry, now you give me those,<br>and I'll get them signed.
<SYNC Start=1172925><P Class=ENCC>
All of you wait outside.<br>That's it.
<SYNC Start=1176417><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1185771><P Class=ENCC>
I'll bet you loved that,<br>didn't you, Potter?
<SYNC Start=1188440><P Class=ENCC>
Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into<br>a bookshop without making the front page.
<SYNC Start=1192900><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1193545><P Class=ENCC>
Leave him alone.
<SYNC Start=1195447><P Class=ENCC>
Look, Potter.<br>You've got yourself a girlfriend.
<SYNC Start=1199117><P Class=ENCC>
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.
<SYNC Start=1203555><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Potter.
<SYNC Start=1204783><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1207226><P Class=ENCC>
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.
<SYNC Start=1211363><P Class=ENCC>
Forgive me.
<SYNC Start=1213558><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1214967><P Class=ENCC>
Your scar is legend.
<SYNC Start=1216992><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1217536><P Class=ENCC>
As, of course, is the wizard<br>who gave it to you.
<SYNC Start=1220172><P Class=ENCC>
Voldemort killed my parents.
<SYNC Start=1222265><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1224409><P Class=ENCC>
He was nothing more than a murderer.
<SYNC Start=1227845><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1228914><P Class=ENCC>
You must be very brave<br>to mention his name.
<SYNC Start=1231849><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1232517><P Class=ENCC>
Or very foolish.
<SYNC Start=1234253><P Class=ENCC>
Fear of a name only increases<br>fear of the thing itself.
<SYNC Start=1237780><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1239391><P Class=ENCC>
And you must be Miss Granger.
<SYNC Start=1242656><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1245530><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, Draco has told me<br>all about you. And your parents.
<SYNC Start=1249796><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1254473><P Class=ENCC>
Muggles, aren't they?
<SYNC Start=1257909><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1260812><P Class=ENCC>
Let me see.<br>Red hair, vacant expressions...
<SYNC Start=1265909><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1267352><P Class=ENCC>
...tatty, secondhand book.
<SYNC Start=1271023><P Class=ENCC>
You must be the Weasleys.
<SYNC Start=1274660><P Class=ENCC>
It's mad in here.<br>Let's go outside.
<SYNC Start=1276862><P Class=ENCC>
- Well, well, well. Weasley senior.<br>- Lucius.
<SYNC Start=1280732><P Class=ENCC>
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,<br>all those extra raids?
<SYNC Start=1285604><P Class=ENCC>
l do hope they're paying you overtime...
<SYNC Start=1288106><P Class=ENCC>
...but judging by the state of this,<br>l'd say not.
<SYNC Start=1291234><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1293078><P Class=ENCC>
What's the use in being a disgrace<br>to the name of wizard...
<SYNC Start=1296982><P Class=ENCC>
...if they don't even pay you well for it?
<SYNC Start=1299351><P Class=ENCC>
We have a very different idea about what<br>disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.
<SYNC Start=1304623><P Class=ENCC>
Clearly.
<SYNC Start=1306420><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1308493><P Class=ENCC>
Associating with Muggles.
<SYNC Start=1312190><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1316435><P Class=ENCC>
And l thought your family<br>could sink no lower.
<SYNC Start=1320929><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1324276><P Class=ENCC>
I'll see you at work.
<SYNC Start=1327074><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1331216><P Class=ENCC>
See you at school.
<SYNC Start=1333582><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1341393><P Class=ENCC>
- 10:58. Come on.<br>- The train will be leaving any moment.
<SYNC Start=1344262><P Class=ENCC>
Fred, George, Percy, you first.
<SYNC Start=1347527><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1353259><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=1354763><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1360846><P Class=ENCC>
After you, dear.
<SYNC Start=1362575><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1364750><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, Ginny,<br>we'll get you a seat. Hurry.
<SYNC Start=1367981><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1369254><P Class=ENCC>
Let's go.
<SYNC Start=1371347><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1385203><P Class=ENCC>
- What do you two think you're doing?<br>- Sorry.
<SYNC Start=1388840><P Class=ENCC>
Lost control of the trolley.
<SYNC Start=1391809><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1393178><P Class=ENCC>
- Why can't we get through?<br>- l don't know.
<SYNC Start=1395680><P Class=ENCC>
The gateway has sealed<br>itself for some reason.
<SYNC Start=1399047><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1400419><P Class=ENCC>
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.<br>We've missed it.
<SYNC Start=1404523><P Class=ENCC>
Harry, if we can't get through...
<SYNC Start=1408193><P Class=ENCC>
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
<SYNC Start=1410855><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1411830><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe we should just go<br>and wait by the car.
<SYNC Start=1415266><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1416334><P Class=ENCC>
The car.
<SYNC Start=1417665><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1429214><P Class=ENCC>
Ron, l should tell you...
<SYNC Start=1431550><P Class=ENCC>
...most Muggles aren't accustomed<br>to seeing a flying car.
<SYNC Start=1435487><P Class=ENCC>
Right.
<SYNC Start=1436922><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=1437911><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1455173><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster<br>must be faulty.
<SYNC Start=1458944><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, then. Let's go lower.<br>We need to find the train.
<SYNC Start=1462247><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.
<SYNC Start=1463509><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1474459><P Class=ENCC>
All we need to do is catch up<br>with the train.
<SYNC Start=1476661><P Class=ENCC>
We can't be far behind.
<SYNC Start=1478322><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1480332><P Class=ENCC>
- Do you hear that?<br>- We must be getting close.
<SYNC Start=1483435><P Class=ENCC>
Hold on.
<SYNC Start=1485596><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1511897><P Class=ENCC>
Harry!
<SYNC Start=1514024><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1516701><P Class=ENCC>
Hold on!
<SYNC Start=1518498><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1521873><P Class=ENCC>
Take my hand!
<SYNC Start=1524341><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1528647><P Class=ENCC>
Hold on!
<SYNC Start=1530048><P Class=ENCC>
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
<SYNC Start=1533643><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1546231><P Class=ENCC>
- l think we found the train.<br>- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=1549530><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1566184><P Class=ENCC>
Welcome home.
<SYNC Start=1567412><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1583602><P Class=ENCC>
Up! Up!
<SYNC Start=1584796><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1585770><P Class=ENCC>
It's not working!
<SYNC Start=1587897><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1591876><P Class=ENCC>
Up! Ron, mind that tree!
<SYNC Start=1594401><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1597716><P Class=ENCC>
Stop! Stop! Stop!
<SYNC Start=1599843><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1622907><P Class=ENCC>
- My wand. Look at my wand.<br>- Be thankful it's not your neck.
<SYNC Start=1627537><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1629180><P Class=ENCC>
- What's happening?<br>- l don't know.
<SYNC Start=1632149><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1667652><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, go! Fast!
<SYNC Start=1669779><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1704122><P Class=ENCC>
Scabbers, you're okay.
<SYNC Start=1706920><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1708426><P Class=ENCC>
The car!
<SYNC Start=1710451><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1725944><P Class=ENCC>
Dad's gonna kill me.
<SYNC Start=1727775><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1736354><P Class=ENCC>
See you, Hedwig.
<SYNC Start=1738686><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1740024><P Class=ENCC>
So a house-elf shows up<br>in my bedroom...
<SYNC Start=1742460><P Class=ENCC>
...we can't get through the barrier<br>to platform 9 3/4...
<SYNC Start=1745597><P Class=ENCC>
...we almost get killed by a tree...
<SYNC Start=1749000><P Class=ENCC>
Clearly someone doesn't want me<br>here this year.
<SYNC Start=1752527><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1756174><P Class=ENCC>
Well, take a good look, lads.
<SYNC Start=1759277><P Class=ENCC>
This night might well be<br>the last you spend in this castle.
<SYNC Start=1763213><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1766017><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.
<SYNC Start=1769788><P Class=ENCC>
You were seen by no less<br>than seven Muggles.
<SYNC Start=1776427><P Class=ENCC>
Do you have any idea<br>how serious this is?
<SYNC Start=1779191><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1779898><P Class=ENCC>
You have risked<br>the exposure of our world.
<SYNC Start=1783732><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1784402><P Class=ENCC>
Not to mention the damage you<br>inflicted on a Whomping Willow...
<SYNC Start=1787539><P Class=ENCC>
...that's been on these grounds<br>since before you were born.
<SYNC Start=1790633><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1791142><P Class=ENCC>
Honestly, Professor Snape,<br>l think it did more damage to us.
<SYNC Start=1794879><P Class=ENCC>
Silence.
<SYNC Start=1796039><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1798049><P Class=ENCC>
l assure you that were you in Slytherin,<br>and your fate rested with me...
<SYNC Start=1804589><P Class=ENCC>
...the both of you would be<br>on the train home tonight.
<SYNC Start=1808355><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1809561><P Class=ENCC>
- As it is--<br>- They are not.
<SYNC Start=1811791><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1813998><P Class=ENCC>
Professor Dumbledore.<br>Professor McGonagall.
<SYNC Start=1818436><P Class=ENCC>
Headmaster...
<SYNC Start=1820138><P Class=ENCC>
...these boys have flouted the Decree<br>for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.
<SYNC Start=1825109><P Class=ENCC>
- As such--<br>- l am well aware of our bylaws, Severus...
<SYNC Start=1829180><P Class=ENCC>
...having written<br>quite a few of them myself.
<SYNC Start=1832417><P Class=ENCC>
However, as head of Gryffindor house...
<SYNC Start=1835820><P Class=ENCC>
...it is for Professor McGonagall<br>to determine the appropriate action.
<SYNC Start=1841292><P Class=ENCC>
We'll go and get our stuff, then.
<SYNC Start=1843628><P Class=ENCC>
What are you<br>talking about, Mr. Weasley?
<SYNC Start=1846231><P Class=ENCC>
You're going to expel us, aren't you?
<SYNC Start=1848426><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1850034><P Class=ENCC>
Not today, Mr. Weasley...
<SYNC Start=1853338><P Class=ENCC>
...but l must impress on both of you<br>the seriousness of what you have done.
<SYNC Start=1858298><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1858877><P Class=ENCC>
l will be writing to your families tonight,<br>and you will both receive detention.
<SYNC Start=1863439><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1887839><P Class=ENCC>
Morning, everyone.
<SYNC Start=1890307><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1891009><P Class=ENCC>
- Good morning, everyone.<br>- Good morning, Professor Sprout.
<SYNC Start=1893711><P Class=ENCC>
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,<br>second years. Gather around, everyone.
<SYNC Start=1898182><P Class=ENCC>
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.
<SYNC Start=1901152><P Class=ENCC>
Who here can tell me<br>the properties of the Mandrake root?
<SYNC Start=1905323><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, Miss Granger?
<SYNC Start=1907358><P Class=ENCC>
Mandrake, or Mandragora...
<SYNC Start=1909827><P Class=ENCC>
...is used to return those who have been<br>Petrified to their original state.
<SYNC Start=1915033><P Class=ENCC>
It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's<br>cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
<SYNC Start=1920171><P Class=ENCC>
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.
<SYNC Start=1923174><P Class=ENCC>
As our Mandrakes<br>are still only seedlings...
<SYNC Start=1926010><P Class=ENCC>
...their cries won't kill you yet.
<SYNC Start=1928079><P Class=ENCC>
But they could knock you out for several hours,<br>which is why l have given you earmuffs...
<SYNC Start=1932050><P Class=ENCC>
...for auditory protection.
<SYNC Start=1933806><P Class=ENCC>
So could you please put them on,<br>right away? Quickly.
<SYNC Start=1938323><P Class=ENCC>
Flaps tight down,<br>and watch me closely.
<SYNC Start=1941292><P Class=ENCC>
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.
<SYNC Start=1944462><P Class=ENCC>
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.
<SYNC Start=1947454><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1951736><P Class=ENCC>
Got it? And...
<SYNC Start=1953871><P Class=ENCC>
...now you dunk it down<br>into the other pot...
<SYNC Start=1956174><P Class=ENCC>
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil<br>to keep him warm.
<SYNC Start=1960873><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1964515><P Class=ENCC>
Longbottom's been neglecting<br>his earmuffs.
<SYNC Start=1968152><P Class=ENCC>
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.<br>- Yes, well, just leave him there.
<SYNC Start=1972590><P Class=ENCC>
Right, on we go.<br>Plenty of pots to go around.
<SYNC Start=1976294><P Class=ENCC>
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.
<SYNC Start=1979855><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1994779><P Class=ENCC>
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.<br>- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.
<SYNC Start=1998716><P Class=ENCC>
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
<SYNC Start=2001276><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2012764><P Class=ENCC>
Say it. I'm doomed.
<SYNC Start=2016029><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2016901><P Class=ENCC>
- You're doomed.<br>- Hi, Harry.
<SYNC Start=2018835><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2021072><P Class=ENCC>
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.
<SYNC Start=2023975><P Class=ENCC>
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.
<SYNC Start=2025533><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2026110><P Class=ENCC>
Ron, is that your owl?
<SYNC Start=2027941><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2042627><P Class=ENCC>
Bloody bird's a menace.
<SYNC Start=2045289><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2049500><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, no.
<SYNC Start=2051202><P Class=ENCC>
Look, everyone.<br>Weasley's got himself a Howler.
<SYNC Start=2054638><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2056140><P Class=ENCC>
Go on, Ron. l ignored one<br>from my gran once. It was horrible.
<SYNC Start=2061373><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2068553><P Class=ENCC>
Ronald Weasley!
<SYNC Start=2070418><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2073057><P Class=ENCC>
How dare you steal that car!<br>l am absolutely disgusted!
<SYNC Start=2079430><P Class=ENCC>
Your father's now facing<br>an inquiry at work...
<SYNC Start=2082233><P Class=ENCC>
...and it's entirely your fault!
<SYNC Start=2085036><P Class=ENCC>
lf you put another toe out of line...
<SYNC Start=2089107><P Class=ENCC>
...we'll bring you straight home!
<SYNC Start=2092372><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2093144><P Class=ENCC>
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations<br>on making Gryffindor,
<SYNC Start=2096814><P Class=ENCC>
Your father and l are so proud,
<SYNC Start=2100477><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2118769><P Class=ENCC>
Let me introduce you to your new<br>Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
<SYNC Start=2125376><P Class=ENCC>
Me.
<SYNC Start=2127078><P Class=ENCC>
Gilderoy Lockhart...
<SYNC Start=2129780><P Class=ENCC>
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...
<SYNC Start=2133251><P Class=ENCC>
...honorary member<br>of the Dark Force Defense League...
<SYNC Start=2136754><P Class=ENCC>
...and five times winner...
<SYNC Start=2139991><P Class=ENCC>
...of Witch Weekly's<br>Most-Charming-Smile Award.
<SYNC Start=2146264><P Class=ENCC>
But l don't talk about that.
<SYNC Start=2147932><P Class=ENCC>
l didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee<br>by smiling at him.
<SYNC Start=2152460><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2156240><P Class=ENCC>
Now, be warned.
<SYNC Start=2159377><P Class=ENCC>
It is my job to arm you...
<SYNC Start=2161546><P Class=ENCC>
...against the foulest creatures<br>known to wizardkind.
<SYNC Start=2166848><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2167718><P Class=ENCC>
You may find yourselves facing<br>your worst fears in this room.
<SYNC Start=2171455><P Class=ENCC>
Know only that no harm<br>can befall you whilst l am here.
<SYNC Start=2175660><P Class=ENCC>
l must ask you not to scream.
<SYNC Start=2178763><P Class=ENCC>
It might provoke them.
<SYNC Start=2181323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2184802><P Class=ENCC>
Cornish pixies?
<SYNC Start=2186504><P Class=ENCC>
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
<SYNC Start=2189530><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2190374><P Class=ENCC>
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...
<SYNC Start=2192677><P Class=ENCC>
...but pixies can be<br>devilishly tricky little blighters.
<SYNC Start=2197014><P Class=ENCC>
Let's see what you make of them.
<SYNC Start=2199915><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2204255><P Class=ENCC>
Come on now, round them up.<br>They're only pixies.
<SYNC Start=2207520><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2223274><P Class=ENCC>
- You just stay there!<br>- Please, get me down!
<SYNC Start=2227370><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2229714><P Class=ENCC>
- Get off me!<br>- Stop. Hold still!
<SYNC Start=2232182><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2233818><P Class=ENCC>
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!
<SYNC Start=2237015><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2257041><P Class=ENCC>
I'll ask you three to just nip<br>the rest of them back into their cage.
<SYNC Start=2261307><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2263080><P Class=ENCC>
What do we do now?
<SYNC Start=2265241><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2266751><P Class=ENCC>
lmmobulus!
<SYNC Start=2268241><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2277762><P Class=ENCC>
Why is it always me?
<SYNC Start=2280026><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2286337><P Class=ENCC>
l spent the summer devising<br>a whole new Quidditch program.
<SYNC Start=2289206><P Class=ENCC>
We're gonna train earlier,<br>harder and longer.
<SYNC Start=2293044><P Class=ENCC>
What--? l don't believe it.
<SYNC Start=2296343><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2299116><P Class=ENCC>
- Where you think you're going, Flint?<br>- Quidditch practice.
<SYNC Start=2301986><P Class=ENCC>
- l booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.<br>- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.
<SYNC Start=2306389><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2307792><P Class=ENCC>
l smell trouble.
<SYNC Start=2309987><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2310594><P Class=ENCC>
"l, Professor Severus Snape,<br>do hereby give the Slytherin team...
<SYNC Start=2314298><P Class=ENCC>
...permission to practice today, owing<br>to the need to train their new Seeker."
<SYNC Start=2317968><P Class=ENCC>
You've got a new Seeker. Who?
<SYNC Start=2320630><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2324642><P Class=ENCC>
- Malfoy?<br>- That's right.
<SYNC Start=2327445><P Class=ENCC>
And that's not all<br>that's new this year.
<SYNC Start=2330209><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2331048><P Class=ENCC>
Those are Nimbus 2001s.<br>How did you get those?
<SYNC Start=2334652><P Class=ENCC>
A gift from Draco's father.
<SYNC Start=2336921><P Class=ENCC>
You see, Weasley, unlike some,<br>my father can afford the best.
<SYNC Start=2340758><P Class=ENCC>
At least no one on the Gryffindor team<br>had to buy their way in.
<SYNC Start=2343928><P Class=ENCC>
They got in on pure talent.
<SYNC Start=2346863><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2350067><P Class=ENCC>
No one asked your opinion,<br>you filthy little Mudblood.
<SYNC Start=2353935><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2356474><P Class=ENCC>
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.<br>Eat slugs!
<SYNC Start=2359910><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2367485><P Class=ENCC>
You okay, Ron?
<SYNC Start=2369350><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2372356><P Class=ENCC>
Say something.
<SYNC Start=2374153><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2380398><P Class=ENCC>
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?<br>- No, Colin, get out of the way.
<SYNC Start=2384926><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2385870><P Class=ENCC>
Let's take him to Hagrid's.
<SYNC Start=2388072><P Class=ENCC>
He'll know what to do.
<SYNC Start=2390199><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2399083><P Class=ENCC>
This calls for<br>a specialist's equipment.
<SYNC Start=2402450><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2406223><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,<br>I'm afraid.
<SYNC Start=2409818><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2410461><P Class=ENCC>
- Okay.<br>- Better out than in.
<SYNC Start=2413658><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2414231><P Class=ENCC>
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?<br>- Malfoy. He called Hermione...
<SYNC Start=2419567><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2420805><P Class=ENCC>
Well, l don't know<br>exactly what it means.
<SYNC Start=2424241><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2428212><P Class=ENCC>
He called me a Mudblood.
<SYNC Start=2430581><P Class=ENCC>
- He did not.<br>- What's a Mudblood?
<SYNC Start=2433617><P Class=ENCC>
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a really<br>foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.
<SYNC Start=2438322><P Class=ENCC>
Someone with non-magic parents.<br>Someone like me.
<SYNC Start=2442588><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2443093><P Class=ENCC>
It's not a term one usually hears<br>in civilized conversation.
<SYNC Start=2447223><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2448365><P Class=ENCC>
See, the thing is, Harry, there are<br>some wizards, like the Malfoy family...
<SYNC Start=2453370><P Class=ENCC>
...who think they're better than everyone<br>else because they're pure-blood.
<SYNC Start=2458209><P Class=ENCC>
That's horrible.
<SYNC Start=2459836><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2462780><P Class=ENCC>
It's disgusting.
<SYNC Start=2464281><P Class=ENCC>
And it's codswallop to boot.<br>Dirty blood.
<SYNC Start=2467952><P Class=ENCC>
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today<br>that's not half-blood or less.
<SYNC Start=2471489><P Class=ENCC>
More to the point, they've yet to think<br>of a spell that our Hermione can't do.
<SYNC Start=2476227><P Class=ENCC>
Come here.
<SYNC Start=2478422><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2479530><P Class=ENCC>
Don't you think on it, Hermione.<br>Don't you think on it for one minute.
<SYNC Start=2485992><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2493811><P Class=ENCC>
Harry, Harry, Harry.
<SYNC Start=2497014><P Class=ENCC>
Can you possibly imagine...
<SYNC Start=2499416><P Class=ENCC>
...a better way to serve detention...
<SYNC Start=2502647><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2503287><P Class=ENCC>
...than by helping me<br>to answer my fan mail?
<SYNC Start=2506156><P Class=ENCC>
Not really.
<SYNC Start=2507725><P Class=ENCC>
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.<br>Celebrity is as celebrity does.
<SYNC Start=2514265><P Class=ENCC>
Remember that.
<SYNC Start=2516199><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2519970><P Class=ENCC>
Come.
<SYNC Start=2522273><P Class=ENCC>
Come...
<SYNC Start=2524332><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2525643><P Class=ENCC>
...to me.
<SYNC Start=2528510><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2531815><P Class=ENCC>
- What?<br>- Sorry?
<SYNC Start=2534340><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2536587><P Class=ENCC>
That voice.
<SYNC Start=2538722><P Class=ENCC>
Voice?
<SYNC Start=2540246><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2543827><P Class=ENCC>
- Didn't you hear it?<br>- What are you talking about, Harry?
<SYNC Start=2548457><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2549066><P Class=ENCC>
l think you're getting<br>a bit drowsy.
<SYNC Start=2552836><P Class=ENCC>
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the<br>time. We've been here nearly four hours.
<SYNC Start=2557241><P Class=ENCC>
Spooky how the time flies<br>when one is having fun.
<SYNC Start=2560608><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2565583><P Class=ENCC>
Spooky.
<SYNC Start=2568108><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2571155><P Class=ENCC>
Blood.
<SYNC Start=2573457><P Class=ENCC>
l smell blood.
<SYNC Start=2577161><P Class=ENCC>
Let me rip you.
<SYNC Start=2580364><P Class=ENCC>
Let me kill you.
<SYNC Start=2583959><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2585803><P Class=ENCC>
Kill!
<SYNC Start=2587270><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2588205><P Class=ENCC>
Kill!
<SYNC Start=2589502><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2590240><P Class=ENCC>
- Kill!<br>- Harry!
<SYNC Start=2592343><P Class=ENCC>
- Did you hear it?<br>- Hear what?
<SYNC Start=2594979><P Class=ENCC>
- That voice.<br>- Voice? What voice?
<SYNC Start=2598582><P Class=ENCC>
l heard it first in Lockhart's office.<br>And then again just--
<SYNC Start=2602820><P Class=ENCC>
It's time.
<SYNC Start=2605089><P Class=ENCC>
It's moving.<br>l think it's going to kill.
<SYNC Start=2608286><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2609259><P Class=ENCC>
- Kill?<br>- Harry, wait! Not so fast!
<SYNC Start=2613218><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2638822><P Class=ENCC>
Strange.
<SYNC Start=2640813><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2641358><P Class=ENCC>
- I've never seen spiders act like that.<br>- l don't like spiders.
<SYNC Start=2645852><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2649967><P Class=ENCC>
What's that?
<SYNC Start=2652026><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2655506><P Class=ENCC>
"The Chamber of Secrets has been<br>opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."
<SYNC Start=2660210><P Class=ENCC>
It's written in blood.
<SYNC Start=2662474><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2665416><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, no.
<SYNC Start=2667577><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2672289><P Class=ENCC>
It's Filch's cat.
<SYNC Start=2674553><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2675092><P Class=ENCC>
It's Mrs. Norris.
<SYNC Start=2677356><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2693477><P Class=ENCC>
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."
<SYNC Start=2696173><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2697681><P Class=ENCC>
You'll be next, Mudbloods.
<SYNC Start=2700150><P Class=ENCC>
What's going on here?<br>Go on. Make way, make way.
<SYNC Start=2705315><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2706790><P Class=ENCC>
Potter?
<SYNC Start=2708792><P Class=ENCC>
What are you...?
<SYNC Start=2710919><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2714231><P Class=ENCC>
Mrs. Norris?
<SYNC Start=2716529><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2718068><P Class=ENCC>
- You've murdered my cat.<br>- No. No.
<SYNC Start=2722639><P Class=ENCC>
I'll kill you.
<SYNC Start=2723901><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2726243><P Class=ENCC>
- I'll kill you!<br>- Argus!
<SYNC Start=2729076><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2730481><P Class=ENCC>
Argus, l...
<SYNC Start=2732608><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2734618><P Class=ENCC>
Everyone will proceed<br>to their dormitories immediately.
<SYNC Start=2739248><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2739990><P Class=ENCC>
Everyone except...
<SYNC Start=2741958><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2742760><P Class=ENCC>
...you three.
<SYNC Start=2744955><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2747097><P Class=ENCC>
Ravenclaws, follow me.
<SYNC Start=2749861><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2751735><P Class=ENCC>
She's not dead, Argus.<br>She has been Petrified.
<SYNC Start=2755806><P Class=ENCC>
Thought so.<br>So unlucky l wasn't there.
<SYNC Start=2758809><P Class=ENCC>
l know exactly the countercurse<br>that could've spared her.
<SYNC Start=2761937><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2764281><P Class=ENCC>
But how she has been Petrified,<br>l cannot say.
<SYNC Start=2767184><P Class=ENCC>
Ask him.<br>It's him that's done it.
<SYNC Start=2770053><P Class=ENCC>
You saw what he wrote on the wall.
<SYNC Start=2772923><P Class=ENCC>
It's not true, sir. l swear.<br>l never touched Mrs. Norris.
<SYNC Start=2777194><P Class=ENCC>
- Rubbish.<br>- lf l might, headmaster?
<SYNC Start=2782099><P Class=ENCC>
Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply<br>in the wrong place at the wrong time.
<SYNC Start=2786900><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2787437><P Class=ENCC>
However...
<SYNC Start=2789673><P Class=ENCC>
...the circumstances are suspicious.
<SYNC Start=2792810><P Class=ENCC>
l, for one, don't recall<br>seeing Potter at dinner.
<SYNC Start=2797614><P Class=ENCC>
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.
<SYNC Start=2800050><P Class=ENCC>
You see, Harry was helping me<br>answer my fan mail.
<SYNC Start=2803620><P Class=ENCC>
That's why Ron and l<br>went looking for him, professor.
<SYNC Start=2807090><P Class=ENCC>
We'd just found him when he said...
<SYNC Start=2809820><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2812095><P Class=ENCC>
- Yes, Miss Granger?<br>- When l said l wasn't hungry.
<SYNC Start=2815929><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2817334><P Class=ENCC>
We were heading back to the common<br>room when we found Mrs. Norris.
<SYNC Start=2820214><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2823765><P Class=ENCC>
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.<br>- My cat has been Petrified.
<SYNC Start=2829294><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2830138><P Class=ENCC>
- l want to see some punishment!<br>- We will be able to cure her, Argus.
<SYNC Start=2835974><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2836911><P Class=ENCC>
As l understand it, Madam Sprout<br>has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.
<SYNC Start=2841850><P Class=ENCC>
When matured, a potion will be made<br>which will revive Mrs. Norris.
<SYNC Start=2846621><P Class=ENCC>
And in the meantime...
<SYNC Start=2848316><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2848890><P Class=ENCC>
...l strongly recommend caution...
<SYNC Start=2852883><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2853561><P Class=ENCC>
...to all.
<SYNC Start=2855552><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2866205><P Class=ENCC>
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?<br>- Strange?
<SYNC Start=2869808><P Class=ENCC>
You hear this voice,<br>a voice only you can hear...
<SYNC Start=2872745><P Class=ENCC>
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up<br>Petrified. It's just strange.
<SYNC Start=2877616><P Class=ENCC>
Do you think l should have told them?<br>Dumbledore and the others, l mean?
<SYNC Start=2880953><P Class=ENCC>
Are you mad?
<SYNC Start=2882621><P Class=ENCC>
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,<br>hearing voices isn't a good sign.
<SYNC Start=2888082><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2890229><P Class=ENCC>
She's right, you know.
<SYNC Start=2892595><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2896935><P Class=ENCC>
Could l have your attention,<br>please?
<SYNC Start=2899267><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2899805><P Class=ENCC>
Right. Now, today,<br>we will be transforming animals...
<SYNC Start=2905477><P Class=ENCC>
...into water goblets.
<SYNC Start=2907843><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2908781><P Class=ENCC>
Like so.
<SYNC Start=2910616><P Class=ENCC>
One, two, three.<br>vera verto.
<SYNC Start=2915519><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2919091><P Class=ENCC>
Now it's your turn.<br>Who would like to go first?
<SYNC Start=2922993><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2923596><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Weasley.<br>"One, two, three. vera verto."
<SYNC Start=2928533><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2932138><P Class=ENCC>
vera verto!
<SYNC Start=2934231><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2940279><P Class=ENCC>
That wand needs replacing,<br>Mr. Weasley.
<SYNC Start=2942941><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2944283><P Class=ENCC>
- Yes, Miss Granger?<br>- Professor...
<SYNC Start=2946619><P Class=ENCC>
...l was wondering if you could tell us<br>about the Chamber of Secrets.
<SYNC Start=2950817><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2957029><P Class=ENCC>
Very well.
<SYNC Start=2958291><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2959799><P Class=ENCC>
You all know, of course...
<SYNC Start=2961967><P Class=ENCC>
...that Hogwarts was founded<br>over a thousand years ago...
<SYNC Start=2966005><P Class=ENCC>
...by the four greatest witches<br>and wizards of the age:
<SYNC Start=2970609><P Class=ENCC>
Godric Gryffindor,<br>Helga Hufflepuff...
<SYNC Start=2974513><P Class=ENCC>
...Rowena Ravenclaw<br>and Salazar Slytherin.
<SYNC Start=2980145><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2980820><P Class=ENCC>
Now, three of the founders<br>coexisted quite harmoniously.
<SYNC Start=2987026><P Class=ENCC>
- One did not.<br>- Three guesses who.
<SYNC Start=2990018><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2990796><P Class=ENCC>
Salazar Slytherin wished to be<br>more selective...
<SYNC Start=2993399><P Class=ENCC>
...about the students admitted<br>to Hogwarts.
<SYNC Start=2996736><P Class=ENCC>
He believed magical learning should<br>be kept within all-magic families.
<SYNC Start=3001507><P Class=ENCC>
In other words, pure-bloods.
<SYNC Start=3004009><P Class=ENCC>
Unable to sway the others,<br>he decided to leave the school.
<SYNC Start=3009345><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3010182><P Class=ENCC>
Now, according to legend...
<SYNC Start=3012585><P Class=ENCC>
...Slytherin had built<br>a hidden chamber in this castle...
<SYNC Start=3016489><P Class=ENCC>
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.
<SYNC Start=3020326><P Class=ENCC>
Though, shortly before departing,<br>he sealed it...
<SYNC Start=3024930><P Class=ENCC>
...until that time when his own<br>true Heir returned to the school.
<SYNC Start=3029235><P Class=ENCC>
The Heir alone...
<SYNC Start=3031771><P Class=ENCC>
...would be able to open the Chamber...
<SYNC Start=3034607><P Class=ENCC>
...and unleash the horror within,<br>and by so doing...
<SYNC Start=3039545><P Class=ENCC>
...purge the school<br>of all those who...
<SYNC Start=3043082><P Class=ENCC>
...in Slytherin's view,<br>were unworthy to study magic.
<SYNC Start=3048076><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3048687><P Class=ENCC>
Muggle-borns.
<SYNC Start=3050814><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3051891><P Class=ENCC>
Naturally, the school<br>has been searched many times.
<SYNC Start=3055694><P Class=ENCC>
No such chamber has been found.
<SYNC Start=3059130><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3059765><P Class=ENCC>
Professor? What exactly does legend<br>tell us lies within the Chamber?
<SYNC Start=3064327><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3065171><P Class=ENCC>
The Chamber is said to be home<br>to something...
<SYNC Start=3067940><P Class=ENCC>
...that only the Heir of Slytherin<br>can control.
<SYNC Start=3071501><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3072144><P Class=ENCC>
It is said to be the home...
<SYNC Start=3075948><P Class=ENCC>
...of a monster.
<SYNC Start=3077575><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3083355><P Class=ENCC>
Do you think it's true? Do you think<br>there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
<SYNC Start=3087159><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's<br>worried. All the teachers are.
<SYNC Start=3091564><P Class=ENCC>
lf there really is a Chamber of Secrets,<br>and it really has been opened, that means--
<SYNC Start=3095601><P Class=ENCC>
The Heir of Slytherin has returned<br>to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
<SYNC Start=3099705><P Class=ENCC>
Let's think. Who do we know who<br>thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
<SYNC Start=3104243><P Class=ENCC>
- lf you're talking about Malfoy--<br>- Of course. You heard him.
<SYNC Start=3107079><P Class=ENCC>
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."
<SYNC Start=3108981><P Class=ENCC>
l heard him.<br>But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
<SYNC Start=3111750><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.<br>l mean, look at his family.
<SYNC Start=3115087><P Class=ENCC>
The whole lot of them have been<br>in Slytherin for centuries.
<SYNC Start=3118090><P Class=ENCC>
Crabbe and Goyle must know.<br>Maybe we could trick them into telling.
<SYNC Start=3121894><P Class=ENCC>
Even they aren't that thick.<br>But there might be another way.
<SYNC Start=3126232><P Class=ENCC>
Mind you, it would be difficult.
<SYNC Start=3128267><P Class=ENCC>
Not to mention we'd be breaking<br>about 50 school rules...
<SYNC Start=3131470><P Class=ENCC>
...and it'll be dangerous.<br>Very dangerous.
<SYNC Start=3135930><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3142748><P Class=ENCC>
Here it is.<br>The Polyjuice Potion.
<SYNC Start=3145384><P Class=ENCC>
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion<br>allows the drinker...
<SYNC Start=3148287><P Class=ENCC>
...to transform himself temporarily<br>into the physical form of another."
<SYNC Start=3152725><P Class=ENCC>
You mean if Harry and l drink that stuff,<br>we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
<SYNC Start=3156695><P Class=ENCC>
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.<br>- Exactly.
<SYNC Start=3160232><P Class=ENCC>
But it's tricky. I've never seen<br>a more complicated potion.
<SYNC Start=3164270><P Class=ENCC>
- How long will it take to make?<br>- A month.
<SYNC Start=3167740><P Class=ENCC>
A month?
<SYNC Start=3169375><P Class=ENCC>
But, Hermione,<br>if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...
<SYNC Start=3173379><P Class=ENCC>
...he could attack half<br>the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
<SYNC Start=3176749><P Class=ENCC>
l know.
<SYNC Start=3178817><P Class=ENCC>
But it's the only plan we've got.
<SYNC Start=3181581><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3231337><P Class=ENCC>
Another goal for Slytherin!
<SYNC Start=3234033><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3235374><P Class=ENCC>
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.
<SYNC Start=3238775><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3239878><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah!
<SYNC Start=3241714><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah!
<SYNC Start=3243477><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3267773><P Class=ENCC>
All right there, Scarhead?
<SYNC Start=3270105><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3276215><P Class=ENCC>
Watch yourself, Harry!
<SYNC Start=3279118><P Class=ENCC>
Wood, look out!
<SYNC Start=3280881><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3294600><P Class=ENCC>
Blimey! Harry's got himself<br>a rogue Bludger.
<SYNC Start=3297603><P Class=ENCC>
That's been tampered with, that has.
<SYNC Start=3299366><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3300339><P Class=ENCC>
I'll stop it.
<SYNC Start=3301507><P Class=ENCC>
No! Even with a proper wand,<br>it's too risky. You could hit Harry.
<SYNC Start=3306137><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3331236><P Class=ENCC>
Training for the ballet, Potter?
<SYNC Start=3333830><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3364770><P Class=ENCC>
You'll never catch me, Potter.
<SYNC Start=3367000><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3457829><P Class=ENCC>
Let's go.
<SYNC Start=3459064><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch,<br>Gryffindor wins!
<SYNC Start=3464297><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3470609><P Class=ENCC>
Finite Incantatem!
<SYNC Start=3472634><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3479718><P Class=ENCC>
- Thank you.<br>- Are you okay?
<SYNC Start=3481186><P Class=ENCC>
No. l think my arm is broken.
<SYNC Start=3483422><P Class=ENCC>
Not to worry, Harry. l will fix<br>that arm of yours straightaway.
<SYNC Start=3487392><P Class=ENCC>
- Not you.<br>- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.
<SYNC Start=3490529><P Class=ENCC>
This won't hurt a bit.
<SYNC Start=3494021><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3500172><P Class=ENCC>
Brackium Emendo!
<SYNC Start=3503164><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3511216><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, well,<br>that can sometimes happen...
<SYNC Start=3514486><P Class=ENCC>
...but the point is...
<SYNC Start=3516716><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3518123><P Class=ENCC>
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,<br>very clearly, the bones are not broken.
<SYNC Start=3522427><P Class=ENCC>
Broken? There's no bones left.
<SYNC Start=3525055><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3526798><P Class=ENCC>
Much more flexible, though.
<SYNC Start=3528766><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3531236><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.<br>You can go. Out of my way.
<SYNC Start=3535340><P Class=ENCC>
Should have been brought<br>straight to me.
<SYNC Start=3537442><P Class=ENCC>
l can mend bones in a heartbeat,<br>but growing them back...
<SYNC Start=3540078><P Class=ENCC>
You will be able to, won't you?
<SYNC Start=3541747><P Class=ENCC>
I'll be able to, certainly.<br>But it'll be painful.
<SYNC Start=3544875><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3545517><P Class=ENCC>
You're in for a rough night, Potter.<br>Regrowing bones is a nasty business.
<SYNC Start=3550181><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3553091><P Class=ENCC>
What do you expect?<br>Pumpkin juice?
<SYNC Start=3556083><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3562768><P Class=ENCC>
Kill.
<SYNC Start=3564531><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3565370><P Class=ENCC>
Kill.
<SYNC Start=3566894><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3572277><P Class=ENCC>
Time to kill.
<SYNC Start=3575508><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3581653><P Class=ENCC>
Hello.
<SYNC Start=3582642><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3584456><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby?
<SYNC Start=3585691><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter should have listened<br>to Dobby.
<SYNC Start=3588493><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter should have gone back home<br>when he missed the train.
<SYNC Start=3592397><P Class=ENCC>
It was you. You stopped the barrier<br>from letting Ron and me through.
<SYNC Start=3597302><P Class=ENCC>
Indeed. Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=3600271><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3601273><P Class=ENCC>
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.<br>- At least you would be away from here.
<SYNC Start=3606478><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter must go home.
<SYNC Start=3609314><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby thought his Bludger would be<br>enough to make Harry Potter see--
<SYNC Start=3613085><P Class=ENCC>
Your Bludger? You made<br>that Bludger chase after me?
<SYNC Start=3616655><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.
<SYNC Start=3620359><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby had to iron his hands.
<SYNC Start=3623988><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3626231><P Class=ENCC>
You better clear off before my bones<br>come back, Dobby, or l might strangle you.
<SYNC Start=3630827><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3633472><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.<br>Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
<SYNC Start=3638844><P Class=ENCC>
l don't suppose you could tell me<br>why you're trying to kill me?
<SYNC Start=3641913><P Class=ENCC>
Not kill you, sir.<br>Never kill you.
<SYNC Start=3645951><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby remembers how it was<br>before Harry Potter triumphed...
<SYNC Start=3649488><P Class=ENCC>
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
<SYNC Start=3652758><P Class=ENCC>
We house-elves were<br>treated like vermin, sir.
<SYNC Start=3656661><P Class=ENCC>
Of course, Dobby is still<br>treated like vermin.
<SYNC Start=3662031><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3671376><P Class=ENCC>
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
<SYNC Start=3674179><P Class=ENCC>
This, sir? It is a mark<br>of the house-elf's enslavement.
<SYNC Start=3679484><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby can only be freed if his master<br>presents him with clothes.
<SYNC Start=3684581><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3686725><P Class=ENCC>
Listen.
<SYNC Start=3688293><P Class=ENCC>
Listen!
<SYNC Start=3689995><P Class=ENCC>
Terrible things are<br>about to happen at Hogwarts.
<SYNC Start=3693726><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3694366><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter must not stay here...
<SYNC Start=3696968><P Class=ENCC>
...now that history<br>is to repeat itself.
<SYNC Start=3701673><P Class=ENCC>
Repeat itself? You mean<br>this has happened before?
<SYNC Start=3705310><P Class=ENCC>
l shouldn't have said that.
<SYNC Start=3707301><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3711049><P Class=ENCC>
- Bad Dobby! Bad!<br>- Stop it!
<SYNC Start=3714352><P Class=ENCC>
Stop it, Dobby!
<SYNC Start=3716047><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3717722><P Class=ENCC>
Tell me. When did this happen before?<br>Who's doing it now?
<SYNC Start=3721660><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby<br>only wants Harry Potter to be safe.
<SYNC Start=3727065><P Class=ENCC>
No, Dobby. Tell me.<br>Who is it?
<SYNC Start=3729966><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3741813><P Class=ENCC>
Put him here.
<SYNC Start=3742905><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3747486><P Class=ENCC>
- What happened?<br>- There's been another attack.
<SYNC Start=3750589><P Class=ENCC>
l think he's been Petrified,<br>Madam Pomfrey.
<SYNC Start=3756425><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3757195><P Class=ENCC>
Look. Perhaps he managed<br>to take a picture of his attacker.
<SYNC Start=3761894><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3770008><P Class=ENCC>
What can this mean, Albus?
<SYNC Start=3772944><P Class=ENCC>
It means...
<SYNC Start=3775247><P Class=ENCC>
...that our students<br>are in great danger.
<SYNC Start=3778183><P Class=ENCC>
- What should l tell the staff?<br>- The truth.
<SYNC Start=3781820><P Class=ENCC>
Tell them Hogwarts<br>is no longer safe.
<SYNC Start=3785924><P Class=ENCC>
It is as we feared, Minerva.
<SYNC Start=3789127><P Class=ENCC>
The Chamber of Secrets<br>has indeed been opened again.
<SYNC Start=3793655><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3796535><P Class=ENCC>
Again? You mean the Chamber<br>of Secrets has been opened before?
<SYNC Start=3800839><P Class=ENCC>
Of course.<br>Don't you see?
<SYNC Start=3803742><P Class=ENCC>
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it<br>when he was at school here.
<SYNC Start=3806768><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3807379><P Class=ENCC>
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.<br>- Maybe.
<SYNC Start=3810148><P Class=ENCC>
We'll have to wait for<br>the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
<SYNC Start=3813485><P Class=ENCC>
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing<br>this potion in broad daylight...
<SYNC Start=3817589><P Class=ENCC>
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?<br>Don't you think we'll get caught?
<SYNC Start=3821548><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3822494><P Class=ENCC>
No. No one ever comes in here.
<SYNC Start=3825156><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3825997><P Class=ENCC>
- Why?<br>- Moaning Myrtle.
<SYNC Start=3828700><P Class=ENCC>
Who?
<SYNC Start=3830668><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3831169><P Class=ENCC>
Moaning Myrtle.
<SYNC Start=3833071><P Class=ENCC>
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?<br>- I'm Moaning Myrtle.
<SYNC Start=3836472><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3842347><P Class=ENCC>
l wouldn't expect you to know me.
<SYNC Start=3844883><P Class=ENCC>
Who would ever talk<br>about ugly, miserable...
<SYNC Start=3848086><P Class=ENCC>
...moping Moaning Myrtle?
<SYNC Start=3851522><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3858730><P Class=ENCC>
She's a little sensitive.
<SYNC Start=3860823><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3865370><P Class=ENCC>
Gather round!
<SYNC Start=3867672><P Class=ENCC>
Gather round.<br>Can everybody see me?
<SYNC Start=3872811><P Class=ENCC>
Can you all hear me?
<SYNC Start=3875939><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3876615><P Class=ENCC>
Excellent.
<SYNC Start=3877946><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3878450><P Class=ENCC>
In light of the dark events<br>of recent weeks...
<SYNC Start=3882354><P Class=ENCC>
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me<br>permission to start this Dueling Club...
<SYNC Start=3887225><P Class=ENCC>
...to train you all up in case<br>you ever need to defend yourselves...
<SYNC Start=3892030><P Class=ENCC>
...as l myself have done<br>on countless occasions.
<SYNC Start=3894766><P Class=ENCC>
For full details,<br>see my published works.
<SYNC Start=3898429><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3903074><P Class=ENCC>
Let me introduce my assistant...
<SYNC Start=3906378><P Class=ENCC>
...Professor Snape.
<SYNC Start=3909006><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3912350><P Class=ENCC>
He has sportingly agreed to help<br>with a short demonstration.
<SYNC Start=3915320><P Class=ENCC>
l don't want any of you<br>youngsters to worry.
<SYNC Start=3917522><P Class=ENCC>
You'll still have your Potions master<br>when I'm through with him. Never fear.
<SYNC Start=3922459><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3938143><P Class=ENCC>
One.
<SYNC Start=3939132><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3939978><P Class=ENCC>
Two.
<SYNC Start=3940967><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3941780><P Class=ENCC>
- Three!<br>- Expelliarmus!
<SYNC Start=3944806><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3953425><P Class=ENCC>
- Do you think he's all right?<br>- Who cares?
<SYNC Start=3956261><P Class=ENCC>
An excellent idea to show them that,<br>Professor Snape...
<SYNC Start=3959397><P Class=ENCC>
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was<br>pretty obvious what you were about to do.
<SYNC Start=3964069><P Class=ENCC>
lf l had wanted to stop you,<br>it would have been only too easy.
<SYNC Start=3967472><P Class=ENCC>
Perhaps it would be prudent<br>to first teach the students...
<SYNC Start=3971109><P Class=ENCC>
...to block unfriendly spells,<br>professor.
<SYNC Start=3975603><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3977348><P Class=ENCC>
An excellent suggestion,<br>Professor Snape.
<SYNC Start=3979782><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3981019><P Class=ENCC>
Let's have a volunteer pair.<br>Potter, Weasley, how about you?
<SYNC Start=3985490><P Class=ENCC>
Weasley's wand causes devastation<br>with the simplest spells.
<SYNC Start=3989394><P Class=ENCC>
We'll be sending Potter<br>to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
<SYNC Start=3993298><P Class=ENCC>
Might l suggest someone<br>from my own house?
<SYNC Start=3997325><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3998636><P Class=ENCC>
Malfoy, perhaps?
<SYNC Start=4001104><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4008646><P Class=ENCC>
- Good luck, Potter.<br>- Thank you, sir.
<SYNC Start=4011114><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4019124><P Class=ENCC>
Wands at the ready.
<SYNC Start=4021024><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4021659><P Class=ENCC>
- Scared, Potter?<br>- You wish.
<SYNC Start=4024628><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4035073><P Class=ENCC>
On the count of three...
<SYNC Start=4036975><P Class=ENCC>
...cast your charms to disarm<br>your opponent. Only to disarm.
<SYNC Start=4041479><P Class=ENCC>
We don't want any accidents here.<br>One.
<SYNC Start=4045006><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4046785><P Class=ENCC>
- Two.<br>- Everte Statum!
<SYNC Start=4049345><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4061032><P Class=ENCC>
Rictusempra!
<SYNC Start=4063262><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4074245><P Class=ENCC>
l said disarm only.
<SYNC Start=4076214><P Class=ENCC>
Serpensortia!
<SYNC Start=4078182><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4086791><P Class=ENCC>
Don't move, Potter.<br>I'll get rid of it for you.
<SYNC Start=4089794><P Class=ENCC>
Allow me, Professor Snape.<br>Alarte Ascendare!
<SYNC Start=4095232><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4137809><P Class=ENCC>
Vipera Evanesca.
<SYNC Start=4140403><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4147118><P Class=ENCC>
What are you playing at?
<SYNC Start=4149484><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4162300><P Class=ENCC>
You're a Parselmouth?<br>Why didn't you tell us?
<SYNC Start=4165169><P Class=ENCC>
- I'm a what?<br>- You can talk to snakes.
<SYNC Start=4167605><P Class=ENCC>
l know. l accidentally set a python<br>on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
<SYNC Start=4173077><P Class=ENCC>
Once. But so what?<br>l bet loads of people here can do it.
<SYNC Start=4177215><P Class=ENCC>
No, they can't.<br>It's not a very common gift, Harry.
<SYNC Start=4180981><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4181486><P Class=ENCC>
This is bad.
<SYNC Start=4183354><P Class=ENCC>
What's bad? lf l hadn't told<br>that snake not to attack Justin--
<SYNC Start=4187292><P Class=ENCC>
- That's what you said to it.<br>- You were there. You heard me.
<SYNC Start=4190962><P Class=ENCC>
l heard you speaking Parseltongue.<br>Snake language.
<SYNC Start=4195033><P Class=ENCC>
l spoke a different language?
<SYNC Start=4197900><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4198970><P Class=ENCC>
But l didn't realize--
<SYNC Start=4201539><P Class=ENCC>
How can l speak a language<br>without knowing l can?
<SYNC Start=4204475><P Class=ENCC>
l don't know, but it sounded like you<br>were egging the snake on or something.
<SYNC Start=4208680><P Class=ENCC>
Harry, listen to me.
<SYNC Start=4210782><P Class=ENCC>
There's a reason the symbol<br>of Slytherin house is a serpent.
<SYNC Start=4213818><P Class=ENCC>
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.<br>He could talk to snakes too.
<SYNC Start=4218623><P Class=ENCC>
Exactly.
<SYNC Start=4219824><P Class=ENCC>
Now the whole school's gonna think<br>you're his great-great-great grandson.
<SYNC Start=4223361><P Class=ENCC>
But I'm not.
<SYNC Start=4225329><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4228099><P Class=ENCC>
l can't be.
<SYNC Start=4230033><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4231169><P Class=ENCC>
He lived a thousand years ago.
<SYNC Start=4233371><P Class=ENCC>
For all we know, you could be.
<SYNC Start=4236602><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4266671><P Class=ENCC>
I'll see you back in the common room.
<SYNC Start=4269037><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4285456><P Class=ENCC>
l want blood.
<SYNC Start=4289722><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4292663><P Class=ENCC>
They all must die.
<SYNC Start=4297657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4298236><P Class=ENCC>
Kill.
<SYNC Start=4300227><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4300905><P Class=ENCC>
Kill.
<SYNC Start=4302998><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4303775><P Class=ENCC>
Kill.
<SYNC Start=4306411><P Class=ENCC>
Time to kill.
<SYNC Start=4310472><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4344649><P Class=ENCC>
Caught in the act.
<SYNC Start=4346717><P Class=ENCC>
I'll have you out this time, Potter.
<SYNC Start=4348685><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4349187><P Class=ENCC>
Mark my words.
<SYNC Start=4351856><P Class=ENCC>
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand--
<SYNC Start=4356088><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4382820><P Class=ENCC>
Professor...
<SYNC Start=4384922><P Class=ENCC>
...l swear l didn't.
<SYNC Start=4386491><P Class=ENCC>
This is out of my hands, Potter.
<SYNC Start=4389688><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4399370><P Class=ENCC>
Professor Dumbledore<br>will be waiting for you.
<SYNC Start=4402032><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4410948><P Class=ENCC>
Sherbet Lemon.
<SYNC Start=4413542><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4447451><P Class=ENCC>
Professor Dumbledore?
<SYNC Start=4449578><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4466103><P Class=ENCC>
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?
<SYNC Start=4468799><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4471676><P Class=ENCC>
l was just wondering<br>if you put me in the right house.
<SYNC Start=4476380><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. You were particularly<br>difficult to place.
<SYNC Start=4482019><P Class=ENCC>
But l stand by what l said last year.
<SYNC Start=4485723><P Class=ENCC>
You would have done well in Slytherin.
<SYNC Start=4489327><P Class=ENCC>
You're wrong.
<SYNC Start=4490658><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4519890><P Class=ENCC>
Harry?
<SYNC Start=4521692><P Class=ENCC>
Professor.
<SYNC Start=4524095><P Class=ENCC>
Your bird...<br>There was nothing l could do.
<SYNC Start=4527895><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4528499><P Class=ENCC>
- He just caught fire.<br>- And about time too.
<SYNC Start=4531798><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4532670><P Class=ENCC>
He's been looking dreadful for days.
<SYNC Start=4535139><P Class=ENCC>
Pity you had to see him<br>on a burning day.
<SYNC Start=4537164><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4539076><P Class=ENCC>
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
<SYNC Start=4542480><P Class=ENCC>
They burst into flame<br>when it is time for them to die...
<SYNC Start=4546017><P Class=ENCC>
...and then they are...
<SYNC Start=4548286><P Class=ENCC>
...reborn from the ashes.
<SYNC Start=4551312><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4559764><P Class=ENCC>
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
<SYNC Start=4562767><P Class=ENCC>
They can carry immensely heavy loads.
<SYNC Start=4566837><P Class=ENCC>
Their tears have healing powers.
<SYNC Start=4569670><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4572276><P Class=ENCC>
Professor Dumbledore, sir!<br>Wait! Listen!
<SYNC Start=4575336><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4576314><P Class=ENCC>
Professor Dumbledore, sir,<br>it wasn't Harry.
<SYNC Start=4578441><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4579617><P Class=ENCC>
l'd be prepared to swear it<br> in front of the Ministry of Magic.
<SYNC Start=4582484><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4583954><P Class=ENCC>
Relax.
<SYNC Start=4585854><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4586624><P Class=ENCC>
l do not believe...
<SYNC Start=4588726><P Class=ENCC>
- ...that Harry attacked anyone.<br>- Of course you don't.
<SYNC Start=4592093><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4596033><P Class=ENCC>
Right. Well, I'll...
<SYNC Start=4598803><P Class=ENCC>
- I'll just wait outside, then.<br>- Yes.
<SYNC Start=4601931><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4605609><P Class=ENCC>
- You don't think it was me, professor?<br>- No, Harry.
<SYNC Start=4609447><P Class=ENCC>
l do not think it was you.
<SYNC Start=4611938><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4612983><P Class=ENCC>
But l must ask you...
<SYNC Start=4614780><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4615353><P Class=ENCC>
...is there something<br>you wish to tell me?
<SYNC Start=4619449><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4625863><P Class=ENCC>
No, sir.
<SYNC Start=4627965><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing.
<SYNC Start=4629455><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4632470><P Class=ENCC>
Very well, then.
<SYNC Start=4634805><P Class=ENCC>
Off you go.
<SYNC Start=4636602><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4674578><P Class=ENCC>
Everything's set. We just need a bit<br>of who you're changing into.
<SYNC Start=4678282><P Class=ENCC>
Crabbe and Goyle.
<SYNC Start=4680117><P Class=ENCC>
We also need to make sure<br>that the real Crabbe and Goyle...
<SYNC Start=4683087><P Class=ENCC>
...can't burst in on us<br>while we're interrogating Malfoy.
<SYNC Start=4686657><P Class=ENCC>
- How?<br>- I've got it all worked out.
<SYNC Start=4689527><P Class=ENCC>
l filled these<br>with a simple Sleeping Draught.
<SYNC Start=4692263><P Class=ENCC>
Simple, but powerful.
<SYNC Start=4695266><P Class=ENCC>
Now, once they're asleep...
<SYNC Start=4697601><P Class=ENCC>
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard<br>and pull out a few of their hairs...
<SYNC Start=4700971><P Class=ENCC>
...and put on their uniforms.
<SYNC Start=4703040><P Class=ENCC>
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?<br>- I've already got mine.
<SYNC Start=4706477><P Class=ENCC>
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
<SYNC Start=4709847><P Class=ENCC>
l got this off her robes.
<SYNC Start=4712183><P Class=ENCC>
I'm going to go check<br>on the Polyjuice Potion.
<SYNC Start=4714952><P Class=ENCC>
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle<br>find these.
<SYNC Start=4717682><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4729834><P Class=ENCC>
Ron, maybe l should do it.
<SYNC Start=4732369><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. Right.
<SYNC Start=4734428><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4736640><P Class=ENCC>
Wingardium Leviosa.
<SYNC Start=4738505><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4748586><P Class=ENCC>
Cool.
<SYNC Start=4750178><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4773344><P Class=ENCC>
How thick could you get?
<SYNC Start=4775346><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, let's get them.
<SYNC Start=4777314><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4780017><P Class=ENCC>
We'll have exactly one hour<br>before we change back into ourselves.
<SYNC Start=4783976><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4792196><P Class=ENCC>
Add the hairs.
<SYNC Start=4794164><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4798702><P Class=ENCC>
Essence of Crabbe.
<SYNC Start=4800604><P Class=ENCC>
Cheers.
<SYNC Start=4802504><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4811215><P Class=ENCC>
l think I'm gonna be sick.
<SYNC Start=4813649><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4816554><P Class=ENCC>
Me too.
<SYNC Start=4818385><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4863267><P Class=ENCC>
Harry?
<SYNC Start=4865469><P Class=ENCC>
Ron.
<SYNC Start=4867027><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4867771><P Class=ENCC>
Bloody hell!
<SYNC Start=4869932><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4870741><P Class=ENCC>
We still sound like ourselves.
<SYNC Start=4873177><P Class=ENCC>
You need to sound more like Crabbe.
<SYNC Start=4874940><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4876113><P Class=ENCC>
- Bloody hell.<br>- Excellent.
<SYNC Start=4878749><P Class=ENCC>
- But where's Hermione?<br>- l...
<SYNC Start=4881452><P Class=ENCC>
l don't think I'm going.<br>You go on without me.
<SYNC Start=4884622><P Class=ENCC>
Hermione, are you okay?
<SYNC Start=4886490><P Class=ENCC>
Just go. You're wasting time.
<SYNC Start=4889323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4891395><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=4893056><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4896567><P Class=ENCC>
l think the Slytherin common room's<br>this way.
<SYNC Start=4899934><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4902906><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=4905374><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4907177><P Class=ENCC>
What are you doing d--?
<SYNC Start=4909279><P Class=ENCC>
l mean, what are you doing down here?
<SYNC Start=4911338><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4913283><P Class=ENCC>
l happen to be a school prefect.
<SYNC Start=4916186><P Class=ENCC>
You, on the other hand, have no business<br>wandering the corridors at night.
<SYNC Start=4920555><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4921158><P Class=ENCC>
What are your names again?
<SYNC Start=4923160><P Class=ENCC>
- I'm...<br>- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you two been?
<SYNC Start=4927331><P Class=ENCC>
Pigging out in the Great Hall<br>all this time?
<SYNC Start=4930357><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4931869><P Class=ENCC>
Why are you wearing glasses?
<SYNC Start=4934167><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4935005><P Class=ENCC>
- Reading.<br>- Reading?
<SYNC Start=4937838><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4939009><P Class=ENCC>
l didn't know you could read.
<SYNC Start=4941307><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4944181><P Class=ENCC>
And what are you doing down here,<br>Weasley?
<SYNC Start=4946450><P Class=ENCC>
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.
<SYNC Start=4948475><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4957294><P Class=ENCC>
Well, sit down.
<SYNC Start=4959262><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4961832><P Class=ENCC>
You'd never know the Weasleys<br>were pure-bloods, the way they behave.
<SYNC Start=4966170><P Class=ENCC>
They're an embarrassment<br>to the wizarding world. All of them.
<SYNC Start=4970004><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4970841><P Class=ENCC>
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?
<SYNC Start=4973105><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4975345><P Class=ENCC>
Stomachache.
<SYNC Start=4977074><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4979083><P Class=ENCC>
You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet<br>hasn't done a report on all these attacks.
<SYNC Start=4984021><P Class=ENCC>
l suppose Dumbledore<br>is trying to hush it all up.
<SYNC Start=4986790><P Class=ENCC>
Father always said Dumbledore<br>was the worst thing...
<SYNC Start=4989359><P Class=ENCC>
- ...that ever happened to this place.<br>- You're wrong!
<SYNC Start=4993159><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5000637><P Class=ENCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=5002005><P Class=ENCC>
You think there's someone here<br>who's worse than Dumbledore?
<SYNC Start=5005843><P Class=ENCC>
Well? Do you?
<SYNC Start=5008243><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5008779><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter?
<SYNC Start=5010644><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5017254><P Class=ENCC>
Good one, Goyle.
<SYNC Start=5018822><P Class=ENCC>
You're absolutely right.
<SYNC Start=5020346><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5021024><P Class=ENCC>
Saint Potter.
<SYNC Start=5022855><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5023894><P Class=ENCC>
And people actually think<br>that he's the Heir of Slytherin?
<SYNC Start=5026658><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5030434><P Class=ENCC>
But then you must have some idea<br>who's behind it all.
<SYNC Start=5033203><P Class=ENCC>
You know l don't, Goyle.<br>l told you yesterday.
<SYNC Start=5036900><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5037875><P Class=ENCC>
How many times do l have to tell you?
<SYNC Start=5040343><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5041311><P Class=ENCC>
ls this yours?
<SYNC Start=5043176><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5047618><P Class=ENCC>
But my father did say this:
<SYNC Start=5050420><P Class=ENCC>
It's been 50 years<br>since the Chamber was opened.
<SYNC Start=5053490><P Class=ENCC>
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.<br>Only that they were expelled.
<SYNC Start=5058162><P Class=ENCC>
The last time the Chamber of Secrets<br>was opened, a Mudblood died.
<SYNC Start=5063000><P Class=ENCC>
So it's only a matter of time<br>before one of them is killed this time.
<SYNC Start=5067300><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5067905><P Class=ENCC>
As for me...
<SYNC Start=5069907><P Class=ENCC>
...l hope it's Granger.
<SYNC Start=5072242><P Class=ENCC>
What's the matter with you two?
<SYNC Start=5074611><P Class=ENCC>
You're acting very odd.
<SYNC Start=5077281><P Class=ENCC>
It's his stomachache.
<SYNC Start=5079650><P Class=ENCC>
Calm down.
<SYNC Start=5081709><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5085923><P Class=ENCC>
Scar.
<SYNC Start=5087891><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5091528><P Class=ENCC>
Hair.
<SYNC Start=5092961><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5099136><P Class=ENCC>
Hey! Where are you going?
<SYNC Start=5101434><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5104441><P Class=ENCC>
That was close.
<SYNC Start=5105876><P Class=ENCC>
Hermione, come out.<br>We've got loads to tell you.
<SYNC Start=5108478><P Class=ENCC>
Go away.
<SYNC Start=5110343><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5110848><P Class=ENCC>
Wait till you see. It's awful.
<SYNC Start=5114750><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5116687><P Class=ENCC>
Hermione?
<SYNC Start=5118622><P Class=ENCC>
Are you okay?
<SYNC Start=5120249><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5122326><P Class=ENCC>
Do you remember me telling you...
<SYNC Start=5124261><P Class=ENCC>
...that the Polyjuice Potion<br>was only for human transformations?
<SYNC Start=5127598><P Class=ENCC>
It was cat hair l plucked off<br>Millicent Bulstrode's robes.
<SYNC Start=5131728><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5134104><P Class=ENCC>
Look at my face.
<SYNC Start=5135662><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5136807><P Class=ENCC>
Look at your tail.
<SYNC Start=5139241><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5145816><P Class=ENCC>
Have you spoken to Hermione?
<SYNC Start=5147451><P Class=ENCC>
She should be out of hospital<br>in a few days...
<SYNC Start=5150153><P Class=ENCC>
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.
<SYNC Start=5152951><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5157761><P Class=ENCC>
What's this?
<SYNC Start=5159524><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5164034><P Class=ENCC>
Yuck!
<SYNC Start=5165269><P Class=ENCC>
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's<br>flooded the bathroom.
<SYNC Start=5168067><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5184321><P Class=ENCC>
- Come to throw something else at me?<br>- Why would l throw something at you?
<SYNC Start=5188892><P Class=ENCC>
Don't ask me. Here l am,<br>minding my own business...
<SYNC Start=5193130><P Class=ENCC>
...and someone thinks it's funny<br>to throw a book at me.
<SYNC Start=5196967><P Class=ENCC>
But it can't hurt if someone<br>throws something at you.
<SYNC Start=5200037><P Class=ENCC>
l mean, it'll just go<br>right through you.
<SYNC Start=5202437><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5203473><P Class=ENCC>
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle<br>because she can't feel it.
<SYNC Start=5208045><P Class=ENCC>
Ten points<br>if you get it through her stomach!
<SYNC Start=5210814><P Class=ENCC>
Fifty points if it goes through her head!
<SYNC Start=5214306><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5214851><P Class=ENCC>
- But who threw it at you, anyway?<br>- l don't know. l didn't see them.
<SYNC Start=5219623><P Class=ENCC>
l was just sitting in the U-bend,<br>thinking about death...
<SYNC Start=5223994><P Class=ENCC>
...and it fell through the top<br>of my head.
<SYNC Start=5227657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5257861><P Class=ENCC>
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."
<SYNC Start=5260329><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5290193><P Class=ENCC>
My name...
<SYNC Start=5292696><P Class=ENCC>
...is Harry...
<SYNC Start=5295631><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5297234><P Class=ENCC>
...Potter.
<SYNC Start=5299361><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5312616><P Class=ENCC>
Do you know anything...
<SYNC Start=5317781><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5318622><P Class=ENCC>
...about the Chamber of Secrets?
<SYNC Start=5325323><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5335439><P Class=ENCC>
Can you...
<SYNC Start=5337373><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5338608><P Class=ENCC>
...tell me?
<SYNC Start=5340838><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5403173><P Class=ENCC>
Excuse me. Could you tell me<br>what's going on here?
<SYNC Start=5406609><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5410046><P Class=ENCC>
Are you Tom Riddle?
<SYNC Start=5412549><P Class=ENCC>
Hello, can you hear me?
<SYNC Start=5414346><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5434971><P Class=ENCC>
Riddle!
<SYNC Start=5436700><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5437307><P Class=ENCC>
Come.
<SYNC Start=5439009><P Class=ENCC>
Professor Dumbledore.
<SYNC Start=5441000><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5443180><P Class=ENCC>
Dumbledore?
<SYNC Start=5445341><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5446650><P Class=ENCC>
It is not wise to be wandering around<br>this late hour, Tom.
<SYNC Start=5450287><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, professor. l suppose l...
<SYNC Start=5453823><P Class=ENCC>
l had to see for myself<br>if the rumors were true.
<SYNC Start=5455984><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5456593><P Class=ENCC>
I'm afraid they are, Tom.<br>They are true.
<SYNC Start=5459663><P Class=ENCC>
About the school as well?<br>l don't have a home to go to.
<SYNC Start=5462632><P Class=ENCC>
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,<br>would they, professor?
<SYNC Start=5465635><P Class=ENCC>
l understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...
<SYNC Start=5468160><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5468939><P Class=ENCC>
...Headmaster Dippet<br>may have no choice.
<SYNC Start=5472042><P Class=ENCC>
Sir, if it all stopped,<br>if the person responsible was caught...
<SYNC Start=5476536><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5478815><P Class=ENCC>
ls there something...
<SYNC Start=5480908><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5481851><P Class=ENCC>
...you wish to tell me?
<SYNC Start=5483842><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5485055><P Class=ENCC>
No, sir. Nothing.
<SYNC Start=5487580><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5494397><P Class=ENCC>
Very well, then. Off you go.
<SYNC Start=5497601><P Class=ENCC>
Good night, sir.
<SYNC Start=5499466><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5535572><P Class=ENCC>
- Let's get you out of there.<br>- Evening, Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=5538808><P Class=ENCC>
I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid.<br>l don't think you meant it to kill anyone...
<SYNC Start=5543313><P Class=ENCC>
You can't. You don't understand.
<SYNC Start=5545782><P Class=ENCC>
The dead girl's parents will be here<br>tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...
<SYNC Start=5549085><P Class=ENCC>
...is make sure the thing that killed<br>their daughter is slaughtered.
<SYNC Start=5552255><P Class=ENCC>
It wasn't him.<br>Aragog never killed no one. Never.
<SYNC Start=5555725><P Class=ENCC>
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=5558061><P Class=ENCC>
- Now, stand aside.<br>- No!
<SYNC Start=5559863><P Class=ENCC>
- Stand aside, Hagrid.<br>- No!
<SYNC Start=5561998><P Class=ENCC>
Cistem Aperio!
<SYNC Start=5563625><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5570573><P Class=ENCC>
Arania Exumai!
<SYNC Start=5572939><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5573810><P Class=ENCC>
Aragog!
<SYNC Start=5575328><P Class=ENCC>
Aragog!
<SYNC Start=5576673><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5577213><P Class=ENCC>
l can't let you go.
<SYNC Start=5578612><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5579149><P Class=ENCC>
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.<br>You'll be expelled.
<SYNC Start=5582380><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5584921><P Class=ENCC>
Hagrid!
<SYNC Start=5586821><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5616853><P Class=ENCC>
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened<br>the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
<SYNC Start=5621191><P Class=ENCC>
It can't be Hagrid.<br>It just can't be.
<SYNC Start=5624327><P Class=ENCC>
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.<br>He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.
<SYNC Start=5628565><P Class=ENCC>
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.<br>What would any of us have done?
<SYNC Start=5632369><P Class=ENCC>
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't<br>we just go and ask him about it?
<SYNC Start=5636539><P Class=ENCC>
That would be a cheerful visit.<br>"Hello, Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=5639376><P Class=ENCC>
Tell us, have you been setting anything<br>mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"
<SYNC Start=5643313><P Class=ENCC>
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking<br>about me, now, would you?
<SYNC Start=5646850><P Class=ENCC>
No.
<SYNC Start=5647839><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5652389><P Class=ENCC>
What's that you've got, Hagrid?
<SYNC Start=5654457><P Class=ENCC>
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.<br>For the Mandrakes, you know.
<SYNC Start=5659195><P Class=ENCC>
Now, according to Professor Sprout,<br>they've still got a bit of growing up to do.
<SYNC Start=5663032><P Class=ENCC>
But once their acne's cleared up, we'll<br>be able to chop them up and stew them...
<SYNC Start=5666703><P Class=ENCC>
...and then we'll get those people<br>down at the hospital un-Petrified.
<SYNC Start=5670002><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5671441><P Class=ENCC>
In the meantime, though, you three...
<SYNC Start=5674511><P Class=ENCC>
...had best be looking after yourselves.<br>All right?
<SYNC Start=5677674><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5685555><P Class=ENCC>
Hello, Neville.
<SYNC Start=5687455><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5688591><P Class=ENCC>
Harry, l don't know who did it,<br>but you'd better come.
<SYNC Start=5691461><P Class=ENCC>
Come on!
<SYNC Start=5693156><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5715652><P Class=ENCC>
It had to be a Gryffindor.<br>Nobody else knows our password.
<SYNC Start=5719889><P Class=ENCC>
Unless it wasn't a student.
<SYNC Start=5722292><P Class=ENCC>
Whoever it was, they must have<br>been looking for something.
<SYNC Start=5725895><P Class=ENCC>
And they found it.
<SYNC Start=5727294><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5728031><P Class=ENCC>
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
<SYNC Start=5730522><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5732135><P Class=ENCC>
All right, listen up.
<SYNC Start=5733603><P Class=ENCC>
We play our game,<br>Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.
<SYNC Start=5736673><P Class=ENCC>
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.
<SYNC Start=5738708><P Class=ENCC>
Not to mention they're dead scared<br>that Harry will Petrify them...
<SYNC Start=5741911><P Class=ENCC>
- ...if they fly anywhere near him.<br>- Well, that too.
<SYNC Start=5745369><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5746616><P Class=ENCC>
Professor McGonagall.
<SYNC Start=5748351><P Class=ENCC>
- This match has been canceled.<br>- We can't cancel Quidditch.
<SYNC Start=5751554><P Class=ENCC>
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates<br>will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.
<SYNC Start=5756693><P Class=ENCC>
Potter, you and l will find Mr. Weasley.
<SYNC Start=5759729><P Class=ENCC>
There's something<br>the both of you have to see.
<SYNC Start=5762197><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5764300><P Class=ENCC>
l warn you.<br>This could be a wee bit of a shock.
<SYNC Start=5767895><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5776279><P Class=ENCC>
Hermione!
<SYNC Start=5777647><P Class=ENCC>
She was found near the library...
<SYNC Start=5779444><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5780683><P Class=ENCC>
...along with this.
<SYNC Start=5782742><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5784220><P Class=ENCC>
Does it mean anything to either of you?
<SYNC Start=5787018><P Class=ENCC>
No.
<SYNC Start=5802272><P Class=ENCC>
Could l have your attention, please?
<SYNC Start=5804774><P Class=ENCC>
Because of recent events, these new rules<br>will be put into effect immediately:
<SYNC Start=5810747><P Class=ENCC>
"All students will return to their house<br>common rooms by 6:00 every evening.
<SYNC Start=5816052><P Class=ENCC>
All students will be escorted<br>to each lesson by a teacher.
<SYNC Start=5820256><P Class=ENCC>
No exceptions."
<SYNC Start=5823225><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5823927><P Class=ENCC>
l should tell you this:
<SYNC Start=5826162><P Class=ENCC>
Unless the culprit<br>behind these attacks is caught...
<SYNC Start=5830258><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5830833><P Class=ENCC>
...it is likely the school will be closed.
<SYNC Start=5833996><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5845515><P Class=ENCC>
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.<br>l can't believe it's him...
<SYNC Start=5848618><P Class=ENCC>
...but if he did set the monster loose<br>last time...
<SYNC Start=5851087><P Class=ENCC>
...he'll know how to get inside<br>the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
<SYNC Start=5854457><P Class=ENCC>
But you heard McGonagall.
<SYNC Start=5855858><P Class=ENCC>
We're not allowed to leave<br>the tower except for class.
<SYNC Start=5859629><P Class=ENCC>
l think it's time to get<br>my dad's old cloak out again.
<SYNC Start=5862097><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5875712><P Class=ENCC>
Who's there?
<SYNC Start=5877441><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5881184><P Class=ENCC>
Hello?
<SYNC Start=5882742><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5883419><P Class=ENCC>
Hello?
<SYNC Start=5884909><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5886122><P Class=ENCC>
- What's that for?<br>- Nothing. l was expecting...
<SYNC Start=5890593><P Class=ENCC>
It doesn't matter. Come on in.<br>l just made a pot of tea.
<SYNC Start=5894461><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5897200><P Class=ENCC>
Hagrid, are you okay?
<SYNC Start=5899669><P Class=ENCC>
I'm fine. I'm all right.
<SYNC Start=5902570><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5903506><P Class=ENCC>
Did you hear about Hermione?
<SYNC Start=5905235><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5905742><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. l heard about that, all right.
<SYNC Start=5909746><P Class=ENCC>
Look, we have to ask you something.
<SYNC Start=5913375><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5915084><P Class=ENCC>
Do you know who's opened<br>the Chamber of Secrets?
<SYNC Start=5918576><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5920923><P Class=ENCC>
What you had to understand<br>about that is--
<SYNC Start=5923187><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5924894><P Class=ENCC>
Quick, under the cloak.
<SYNC Start=5926486><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5927163><P Class=ENCC>
Don't say a word.<br>Be quiet, both of you.
<SYNC Start=5930223><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5936672><P Class=ENCC>
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.<br>- Good evening, Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=5939842><P Class=ENCC>
l wonder, could we...?
<SYNC Start=5942445><P Class=ENCC>
Of course. Come in. Come in.
<SYNC Start=5945114><P Class=ENCC>
That's Dad's boss.
<SYNC Start=5946649><P Class=ENCC>
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
<SYNC Start=5950420><P Class=ENCC>
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.<br>Had to come.
<SYNC Start=5954991><P Class=ENCC>
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.<br>Things have gone far enough.
<SYNC Start=5958394><P Class=ENCC>
- The Ministry's got to act.<br>- But l never--
<SYNC Start=5961831><P Class=ENCC>
You know l never, professor.
<SYNC Start=5963766><P Class=ENCC>
l want it understood, Cornelius...
<SYNC Start=5967036><P Class=ENCC>
...that Hagrid...
<SYNC Start=5969038><P Class=ENCC>
...has my full confidence.
<SYNC Start=5971507><P Class=ENCC>
Albus, look,<br>Hagrid's record is against him.
<SYNC Start=5975478><P Class=ENCC>
- I've got to take him.<br>- Take me?
<SYNC Start=5978181><P Class=ENCC>
Take me where?<br>Not Azkaban prison.
<SYNC Start=5980783><P Class=ENCC>
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=5984514><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5985188><P Class=ENCC>
Already here, Fudge?
<SYNC Start=5987256><P Class=ENCC>
Good.
<SYNC Start=5988587><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5989492><P Class=ENCC>
What are you doing here?<br>Get out of my house!
<SYNC Start=5992256><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5992929><P Class=ENCC>
Believe me...
<SYNC Start=5994764><P Class=ENCC>
...l take absolutely no pleasure<br>being inside your...
<SYNC Start=5998962><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6000837><P Class=ENCC>
You call this a house?
<SYNC Start=6003067><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6004140><P Class=ENCC>
No.
<SYNC Start=6005341><P Class=ENCC>
l simply called up the school<br>and was told the headmaster was here.
<SYNC Start=6009412><P Class=ENCC>
Well, what exactly is it<br>that you want with me?
<SYNC Start=6013473><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6014050><P Class=ENCC>
The other governors and l have decided<br>it's time for you to step aside.
<SYNC Start=6018817><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6020456><P Class=ENCC>
This is an order of suspension.
<SYNC Start=6023357><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6028931><P Class=ENCC>
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.
<SYNC Start=6032298><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6036172><P Class=ENCC>
I'm afraid we feel<br>you've rather lost your touch.
<SYNC Start=6040370><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6041110><P Class=ENCC>
Well, what, with all these attacks...
<SYNC Start=6043646><P Class=ENCC>
...there'll be no<br>Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.
<SYNC Start=6046582><P Class=ENCC>
l can only imagine what an awful loss<br>that would be to the school.
<SYNC Start=6051353><P Class=ENCC>
You can't take<br>Professor Dumbledore away.
<SYNC Start=6053822><P Class=ENCC>
Take him away and the Muggle-borns<br>won't stand a chance.
<SYNC Start=6056559><P Class=ENCC>
You mark my words,<br>there'll be killings next!
<SYNC Start=6059195><P Class=ENCC>
You think so?
<SYNC Start=6060930><P Class=ENCC>
Calm yourself, Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=6063421><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6064800><P Class=ENCC>
lf the governors desire my removal...
<SYNC Start=6067703><P Class=ENCC>
...l will, of course, step aside.
<SYNC Start=6071400><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6073008><P Class=ENCC>
However...
<SYNC Start=6075238><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6075911><P Class=ENCC>
...you will find that help<br>will always be given at Hogwarts...
<SYNC Start=6080649><P Class=ENCC>
...to those who...
<SYNC Start=6082685><P Class=ENCC>
...ask for it.
<SYNC Start=6085051><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6091860><P Class=ENCC>
Admirable sentiments.
<SYNC Start=6094363><P Class=ENCC>
Shall we?
<SYNC Start=6096160><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6108277><P Class=ENCC>
Fudge.
<SYNC Start=6109801><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6111547><P Class=ENCC>
Come, Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=6113378><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6114483><P Class=ENCC>
Well?
<SYNC Start=6116041><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6116719><P Class=ENCC>
lf...
<SYNC Start=6118187><P Class=ENCC>
lf anybody was looking for some stuff...
<SYNC Start=6120889><P Class=ENCC>
...then all they'd have to do<br>would be to follow the spiders.
<SYNC Start=6125928><P Class=ENCC>
Yep. That would lead them right.
<SYNC Start=6128697><P Class=ENCC>
That's all l have to say.
<SYNC Start=6130631><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6132368><P Class=ENCC>
And someone will need<br>to feed Fang while I'm away.
<SYNC Start=6136099><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6139475><P Class=ENCC>
Good boy.
<SYNC Start=6141466><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6148040><P Class=ENCC>
Hagrid's right.
<SYNC Start=6150342><P Class=ENCC>
With Dumbledore gone,<br>there'll be an attack a day.
<SYNC Start=6153445><P Class=ENCC>
Look.
<SYNC Start=6155072><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6161186><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=6162983><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6166692><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, Fang.
<SYNC Start=6168717><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6186978><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=6188480><P Class=ENCC>
What?
<SYNC Start=6189981><P Class=ENCC>
You heard what Hagrid said.<br>"Follow the spiders."
<SYNC Start=6193385><P Class=ENCC>
They're heading to the Dark Forest.
<SYNC Start=6196013><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6198056><P Class=ENCC>
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be<br>"follow the butterflies"?
<SYNC Start=6202516><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6238296><P Class=ENCC>
Harry, l don't like this.
<SYNC Start=6240992><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6246104><P Class=ENCC>
- Harry, l don't like this at all.<br>- Shush!
<SYNC Start=6249301><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6260886><P Class=ENCC>
Can we go back now?
<SYNC Start=6263588><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=6265317><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6315006><P Class=ENCC>
Who is it?
<SYNC Start=6317770><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6318476><P Class=ENCC>
Don't panic.
<SYNC Start=6319911><P Class=ENCC>
Hagrid?
<SYNC Start=6321847><P Class=ENCC>
ls that you?
<SYNC Start=6323405><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6324015><P Class=ENCC>
We're friends of Hagrid's.
<SYNC Start=6325949><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6344035><P Class=ENCC>
And you?<br>You're Aragog, aren't you?
<SYNC Start=6347232><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6347873><P Class=ENCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=6349341><P Class=ENCC>
Hagrid has never sent<br>men into our hollow before.
<SYNC Start=6353311><P Class=ENCC>
He's in trouble. Up at the school,<br>there have been attacks.
<SYNC Start=6356439><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6357082><P Class=ENCC>
They think it's Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=6359184><P Class=ENCC>
They think he opened<br>the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
<SYNC Start=6362954><P Class=ENCC>
That's a lie.
<SYNC Start=6365252><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6365757><P Class=ENCC>
Hagrid never opened<br>the Chamber of Secrets.
<SYNC Start=6368692><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6369327><P Class=ENCC>
- Then you're not the monster?<br>- No.
<SYNC Start=6372364><P Class=ENCC>
The monster was born in the castle.
<SYNC Start=6375634><P Class=ENCC>
l came to Hagrid from a distant land<br>in the pocket of a traveler.
<SYNC Start=6380901><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6381506><P Class=ENCC>
Harry.
<SYNC Start=6383133><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6385076><P Class=ENCC>
But if you're not the monster, then<br>what did kill that girl 50 years ago?
<SYNC Start=6389814><P Class=ENCC>
We do not speak of it.
<SYNC Start=6393151><P Class=ENCC>
It is an ancient creature we<br>spiders fear above all others.
<SYNC Start=6398890><P Class=ENCC>
But have you seen it?
<SYNC Start=6400653><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6401326><P Class=ENCC>
l never saw any part of the castle<br>but the box in which Hagrid kept me.
<SYNC Start=6407332><P Class=ENCC>
The girl was discovered<br>in a bathroom.
<SYNC Start=6410669><P Class=ENCC>
When l was accused,<br>Hagrid brought me here.
<SYNC Start=6415340><P Class=ENCC>
- Harry!<br>- What?
<SYNC Start=6417365><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6430188><P Class=ENCC>
Well, thank you.
<SYNC Start=6433180><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6434125><P Class=ENCC>
We'll just go.
<SYNC Start=6436761><P Class=ENCC>
Go?
<SYNC Start=6438697><P Class=ENCC>
l think not.
<SYNC Start=6440632><P Class=ENCC>
My sons and daughters<br>do not harm Hagrid on my command.
<SYNC Start=6446271><P Class=ENCC>
But l cannot deny them<br>fresh meat...
<SYNC Start=6448840><P Class=ENCC>
...when it wanders<br>so willingly into our midst.
<SYNC Start=6453411><P Class=ENCC>
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
<SYNC Start=6457349><P Class=ENCC>
Can we panic now?
<SYNC Start=6459180><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6469894><P Class=ENCC>
Know any spells?
<SYNC Start=6471997><P Class=ENCC>
One, but it's not powerful<br>enough for all of them.
<SYNC Start=6475333><P Class=ENCC>
Where's Hermione when you need her?
<SYNC Start=6478063><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6491549><P Class=ENCC>
Let's go!
<SYNC Start=6492846><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6497989><P Class=ENCC>
Arania Exumai!
<SYNC Start=6500048><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6505363><P Class=ENCC>
Go!
<SYNC Start=6506694><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6524716><P Class=ENCC>
Glad we're out of there.
<SYNC Start=6526741><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6533758><P Class=ENCC>
Arania Exumai!
<SYNC Start=6536090><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6541733><P Class=ENCC>
- Thanks for that.<br>- Don't mention it.
<SYNC Start=6545499><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6556448><P Class=ENCC>
Get us out of here.
<SYNC Start=6558575><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6559117><P Class=ENCC>
Now!
<SYNC Start=6560778><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6562887><P Class=ENCC>
Come on!<br>Come on, move faster!
<SYNC Start=6567119><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6569828><P Class=ENCC>
Come on! Go!
<SYNC Start=6571159><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6588680><P Class=ENCC>
Get us in the air.
<SYNC Start=6590705><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6591816><P Class=ENCC>
The flying gear's jammed!
<SYNC Start=6593283><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6597388><P Class=ENCC>
- Come on! Pull!<br> - I'm trying!
<SYNC Start=6601154><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6630522><P Class=ENCC>
Follow the spiders.<br>Follow the spiders.
<SYNC Start=6633625><P Class=ENCC>
lf Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,<br>I'll kill him.
<SYNC Start=6637959><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6651976><P Class=ENCC>
l mean, what was the point<br>of sending us in there?
<SYNC Start=6655380><P Class=ENCC>
- What have we found out?<br>- We know one thing.
<SYNC Start=6660084><P Class=ENCC>
Hagrid never opened<br>the Chamber of Secrets.
<SYNC Start=6663688><P Class=ENCC>
He was innocent.
<SYNC Start=6665679><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6681172><P Class=ENCC>
Wish you were here, Hermione.
<SYNC Start=6683640><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6684175><P Class=ENCC>
We need you.
<SYNC Start=6686439><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6687412><P Class=ENCC>
Now more than ever.
<SYNC Start=6689471><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6706431><P Class=ENCC>
- What's that?<br>- Ron...
<SYNC Start=6709832><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6710668><P Class=ENCC>
This is why Hermione was in<br>the library the day she was attacked.
<SYNC Start=6715128><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6715673><P Class=ENCC>
Come on.
<SYNC Start=6716935><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6717609><P Class=ENCC>
"Of the many fearsome beasts<br>that roam our land...
<SYNC Start=6720712><P Class=ENCC>
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.<br>Capable of living for hundreds of years...
<SYNC Start=6725516><P Class=ENCC>
...instant death awaits any who meet<br>this giant serpent's eye.
<SYNC Start=6729454><P Class=ENCC>
Spiders flee before it."<br>Ron, this is it.
<SYNC Start=6732624><P Class=ENCC>
The monster in the Chamber<br>of Secrets is a basilisk.
<SYNC Start=6735593><P Class=ENCC>
That's why l can hear it speak.<br>It's a snake.
<SYNC Start=6739864><P Class=ENCC>
But if it kills by looking people<br>in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
<SYNC Start=6745131><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6755813><P Class=ENCC>
Because no one did look it<br>in the eye.
<SYNC Start=6758714><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6760685><P Class=ENCC>
Not directly, at least.
<SYNC Start=6763279><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6764522><P Class=ENCC>
Colin saw it through his camera.
<SYNC Start=6766924><P Class=ENCC>
Justin-- Justin must have seen<br>the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
<SYNC Start=6771129><P Class=ENCC>
Nick got the full blast of it.<br>But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.
<SYNC Start=6775300><P Class=ENCC>
And Hermione had the mirror.
<SYNC Start=6778603><P Class=ENCC>
l bet you she was using it to look<br>around corners in case it came along.
<SYNC Start=6782106><P Class=ENCC>
And Mrs. Norris?
<SYNC Start=6783508><P Class=ENCC>
I'm pretty sure she didn't have<br>a camera or a mirror, Harry.
<SYNC Start=6787000><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6788613><P Class=ENCC>
The water.
<SYNC Start=6790948><P Class=ENCC>
There was water on the floor that night.<br>She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
<SYNC Start=6796477><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6802660><P Class=ENCC>
"Spiders flee before it."
<SYNC Start=6804762><P Class=ENCC>
- It all fits.<br>- But how's a basilisk been getting around?
<SYNC Start=6808666><P Class=ENCC>
A dirty, great snake.<br>Someone would have seen it.
<SYNC Start=6811736><P Class=ENCC>
- Hermione's answered that too.<br>- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.
<SYNC Start=6817508><P Class=ENCC>
Remember what Aragog said<br>about that girl 50 years ago?
<SYNC Start=6821979><P Class=ENCC>
She died in a bathroom?<br>What if she never left?
<SYNC Start=6826211><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6826884><P Class=ENCC>
Moaning Myrtle.
<SYNC Start=6828215><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6829187><P Class=ENCC>
All students are to return<br>to their house dormitories at once,
<SYNC Start=6833391><P Class=ENCC>
All teachers to the second-floor<br>corridor immediately,
<SYNC Start=6836827><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6841766><P Class=ENCC>
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin<br>has left another message.
<SYNC Start=6847772><P Class=ENCC>
Our worst fear has been realized.
<SYNC Start=6850141><P Class=ENCC>
A student has been taken by the monster<br>into the Chamber itself.
<SYNC Start=6854703><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6855813><P Class=ENCC>
The students must be sent home.<br>I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
<SYNC Start=6861479><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6863855><P Class=ENCC>
So sorry. Dozed off.<br>What have l missed?
<SYNC Start=6866457><P Class=ENCC>
A girl has been snatched by the monster,<br>Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.
<SYNC Start=6870995><P Class=ENCC>
- My moment?<br>- Weren't you saying just last night...
<SYNC Start=6874098><P Class=ENCC>
...that you've known all along where<br>the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
<SYNC Start=6878626><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6880004><P Class=ENCC>
That's settled. We'll leave you<br>to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.
<SYNC Start=6885643><P Class=ENCC>
- Your skills, after all, are legend.<br>- Very well.
<SYNC Start=6891048><P Class=ENCC>
I'll just be in my office getting...
<SYNC Start=6894245><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6895086><P Class=ENCC>
Getting ready.
<SYNC Start=6897054><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6899891><P Class=ENCC>
Who is it that the monster's taken,<br>Minerva?
<SYNC Start=6903261><P Class=ENCC>
Ginny Weasley.
<SYNC Start=6905092><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6916507><P Class=ENCC>
"Her skeleton will lie<br>in the Chamber forever."
<SYNC Start=6919567><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6923648><P Class=ENCC>
Ginny.
<SYNC Start=6925411><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6927518><P Class=ENCC>
Lockhart may be useless, but he's<br>going to try and get into the Chamber.
<SYNC Start=6931189><P Class=ENCC>
At least we can tell him<br>what we know.
<SYNC Start=6933919><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6935259><P Class=ENCC>
Professor, we have some information<br>for you.
<SYNC Start=6937819><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6939597><P Class=ENCC>
Are you going somewhere?
<SYNC Start=6941732><P Class=ENCC>
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.<br>Got to go.
<SYNC Start=6945002><P Class=ENCC>
- What about my sister?<br>- Well...
<SYNC Start=6948573><P Class=ENCC>
As to that, most unfortunate.<br>No one regrets more than l.
<SYNC Start=6952243><P Class=ENCC>
You're the Defense Against the Dark<br>Arts teacher. You can't go now.
<SYNC Start=6956414><P Class=ENCC>
l must say, when l took the job,<br>there was nothing in the description--
<SYNC Start=6959550><P Class=ENCC>
You're running away?
<SYNC Start=6960852><P Class=ENCC>
- After all you did in your books?<br>- Books can be misleading.
<SYNC Start=6963821><P Class=ENCC>
- You wrote them.<br>- My dear boy, do use your common sense.
<SYNC Start=6966557><P Class=ENCC>
My books wouldn't have sold half as well<br>if people didn't think l'd done those things.
<SYNC Start=6970960><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6971529><P Class=ENCC>
You're a fraud.
<SYNC Start=6973297><P Class=ENCC>
You've been taking credit<br>for what other wizards have done.
<SYNC Start=6976267><P Class=ENCC>
ls there anything you can do?
<SYNC Start=6978369><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, now you mention it.<br>I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.
<SYNC Start=6983307><P Class=ENCC>
Otherwise, all those wizards<br>would have gone blabbing.
<SYNC Start=6985977><P Class=ENCC>
l'd never have sold another book.
<SYNC Start=6989247><P Class=ENCC>
In fact, I'm going to have to do<br>the same to you.
<SYNC Start=6994981><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6995486><P Class=ENCC>
Don't even think about it.
<SYNC Start=6998250><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7009133><P Class=ENCC>
Who's there?
<SYNC Start=7010566><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7013004><P Class=ENCC>
Hello, Harry.
<SYNC Start=7015029><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7015973><P Class=ENCC>
- What do you want?<br>- To ask you how you died.
<SYNC Start=7021070><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7023447><P Class=ENCC>
It was dreadful.
<SYNC Start=7026083><P Class=ENCC>
It happened right here<br>in this very cubicle.
<SYNC Start=7029954><P Class=ENCC>
l'd hidden because Olive Hornby<br>was teasing me about my glasses.
<SYNC Start=7034158><P Class=ENCC>
l was crying, and then<br>l heard somebody come in.
<SYNC Start=7039230><P Class=ENCC>
- Who was it, Myrtle?<br>- l don't know. l was distraught!
<SYNC Start=7045567><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7046871><P Class=ENCC>
But they said something funny,<br>a kind of made-up language.
<SYNC Start=7050441><P Class=ENCC>
And l realized it was a boy, so l unlocked<br>the door to tell him to go away and...
<SYNC Start=7056812><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7058015><P Class=ENCC>
- ...l died.<br>- Just like that? How?
<SYNC Start=7063020><P Class=ENCC>
l just remember seeing a pair<br>of great, big, yellow eyes...
<SYNC Start=7067692><P Class=ENCC>
...over there by that sink.
<SYNC Start=7071526><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7096587><P Class=ENCC>
This is it.
<SYNC Start=7098578><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7099523><P Class=ENCC>
This is it, Ron. l think this is<br>the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
<SYNC Start=7104324><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7106330><P Class=ENCC>
Say something. Harry,<br>say something in Parseltongue.
<SYNC Start=7111199><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7162720><P Class=ENCC>
Excellent, Harry. Good work.<br>Well, then, I'll just be...
<SYNC Start=7166991><P Class=ENCC>
There's no need for me to stay.
<SYNC Start=7169255><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7169860><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, there is.
<SYNC Start=7171760><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7173564><P Class=ENCC>
- You first.<br>- Now, boys, what good will it do?
<SYNC Start=7176834><P Class=ENCC>
Better you than us.
<SYNC Start=7178165><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7179370><P Class=ENCC>
But-- Obviously, yes.
<SYNC Start=7182305><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7186610><P Class=ENCC>
Sure you don't want to test it first?
<SYNC Start=7189306><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7196153><P Class=ENCC>
It's really quite filthy down here.
<SYNC Start=7199857><P Class=ENCC>
- All right. Let's go.<br>- Oh, Harry?
<SYNC Start=7204795><P Class=ENCC>
lf you die down there,<br>you're welcome to share my toilet.
<SYNC Start=7209732><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7212269><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks, Myrtle.
<SYNC Start=7214237><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7243367><P Class=ENCC>
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,<br>close your eyes straightaway.
<SYNC Start=7248566><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7249507><P Class=ENCC>
Go on.
<SYNC Start=7251168><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7254879><P Class=ENCC>
This way.
<SYNC Start=7256244><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7263220><P Class=ENCC>
- What's this?<br>- It looks like a snake.
<SYNC Start=7268626><P Class=ENCC>
- It's a snakeskin.<br>- Bloody hell.
<SYNC Start=7272463><P Class=ENCC>
Whatever shed this must be<br>60 feet long. Or more.
<SYNC Start=7278265><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7280171><P Class=ENCC>
Heart of a lion, this one.
<SYNC Start=7283140><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7286844><P Class=ENCC>
The adventure ends here, boys.<br>But don't fret.
<SYNC Start=7291508><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7293484><P Class=ENCC>
The world will know our story.<br>How l was too late to save the girl.
<SYNC Start=7299290><P Class=ENCC>
How you two<br>tragically lost your minds...
<SYNC Start=7302960><P Class=ENCC>
...at the sight of her mangled body.
<SYNC Start=7305929><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7306797><P Class=ENCC>
So...
<SYNC Start=7308230><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7309366><P Class=ENCC>
You first, Mr. Potter.
<SYNC Start=7311936><P Class=ENCC>
Say goodbye to your memories.
<SYNC Start=7315099><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7317174><P Class=ENCC>
Obliviate!
<SYNC Start=7319108><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7353043><P Class=ENCC>
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?<br>- I'm fine.
<SYNC Start=7356137><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7359917><P Class=ENCC>
Hello.
<SYNC Start=7361680><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7362353><P Class=ENCC>
Who are you?
<SYNC Start=7364184><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7365556><P Class=ENCC>
- Ron Weasley.<br>- Really?
<SYNC Start=7368392><P Class=ENCC>
And who am l?
<SYNC Start=7371259><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7373030><P Class=ENCC>
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.<br>He hasn't got a clue who he is.
<SYNC Start=7377668><P Class=ENCC>
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?
<SYNC Start=7382306><P Class=ENCC>
Do you live here?
<SYNC Start=7384399><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7385109><P Class=ENCC>
- No.<br>- Really?
<SYNC Start=7387634><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7392249><P Class=ENCC>
- What do l do now?<br>- You wait here...
<SYNC Start=7394218><P Class=ENCC>
...and try and shift some of this rock<br>so we can get back through.
<SYNC Start=7397321><P Class=ENCC>
- I'll go on and find Ginny.<br>- Okay.
<SYNC Start=7400984><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7494251><P Class=ENCC>
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.<br>Wake up, wake up.
<SYNC Start=7498119><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7498622><P Class=ENCC>
Please wake up.
<SYNC Start=7500924><P Class=ENCC>
She won't wake.
<SYNC Start=7503051><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7508532><P Class=ENCC>
Tom. Tom Riddle.<br>What do you mean, she won't wake?
<SYNC Start=7513037><P Class=ENCC>
- She's not...?<br>- She's still alive, but only just.
<SYNC Start=7516404><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7517408><P Class=ENCC>
- Are you a ghost?<br>- A memory...
<SYNC Start=7519910><P Class=ENCC>
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.
<SYNC Start=7522310><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7524982><P Class=ENCC>
She's cold as ice.<br>Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.
<SYNC Start=7530354><P Class=ENCC>
You've got to help me, Tom.<br>There's a basilisk.
<SYNC Start=7532923><P Class=ENCC>
It won't come until it's called.
<SYNC Start=7535517><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7538328><P Class=ENCC>
- Give me my wand, Tom.<br>- You won't be needing it.
<SYNC Start=7541126><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7542199><P Class=ENCC>
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.<br>- I'm afraid l can't do that.
<SYNC Start=7545769><P Class=ENCC>
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,<br>l grow stronger.
<SYNC Start=7549796><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7551175><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley<br>who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
<SYNC Start=7555879><P Class=ENCC>
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
<SYNC Start=7558382><P Class=ENCC>
It was Ginny who set the basilisk<br>on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...
<SYNC Start=7561685><P Class=ENCC>
...Ginny who wrote the threatening<br>messages on the walls.
<SYNC Start=7564288><P Class=ENCC>
- But why?<br>- Because l told her to.
<SYNC Start=7567758><P Class=ENCC>
You'll find l can be very persuasive.<br>Not that she knew what she was doing.
<SYNC Start=7572896><P Class=ENCC>
She was, shall we say,<br>in a kind of trance.
<SYNC Start=7576229><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7576767><P Class=ENCC>
Still, the power of the diary<br>began to scare her.
<SYNC Start=7579436><P Class=ENCC>
She tried to dispose of it<br>in the girls' bathroom.
<SYNC Start=7581972><P Class=ENCC>
And then who should find it but you?
<SYNC Start=7586510><P Class=ENCC>
The very person<br>l was most anxious to meet.
<SYNC Start=7589604><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7590247><P Class=ENCC>
And why did you want to meet me?
<SYNC Start=7592716><P Class=ENCC>
l knew l had to talk to you,<br>meet you if l could.
<SYNC Start=7596253><P Class=ENCC>
So l decided to show you my capture<br>of that brainless oaf Hagrid...
<SYNC Start=7599690><P Class=ENCC>
- ...to gain your trust.<br>- Hagrid's my friend.
<SYNC Start=7602853><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7603794><P Class=ENCC>
- And you framed him, didn't you?<br>- It was my word against Hagrid's.
<SYNC Start=7608565><P Class=ENCC>
Only Dumbledore seemed to think<br>he was innocent.
<SYNC Start=7612002><P Class=ENCC>
I'll bet Dumbledore saw<br>right through you.
<SYNC Start=7614338><P Class=ENCC>
He certainly kept an annoyingly close<br>watch on me after that.
<SYNC Start=7617975><P Class=ENCC>
l knew it wouldn't be safe to open the<br>Chamber again while l was still at school...
<SYNC Start=7621378><P Class=ENCC>
...so l decided to leave behind<br>a diary...
<SYNC Start=7623413><P Class=ENCC>
...preserving my 16-year-old self<br>in its pages...
<SYNC Start=7625682><P Class=ENCC>
...so that one day<br>l would be able to lead another...
<SYNC Start=7628552><P Class=ENCC>
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's<br>noble work.
<SYNC Start=7631522><P Class=ENCC>
Well, you haven't finished it<br>this time.
<SYNC Start=7633957><P Class=ENCC>
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught<br>will be ready.
<SYNC Start=7637094><P Class=ENCC>
And everyone who was Petrified<br>will be all right again.
<SYNC Start=7640230><P Class=ENCC>
Haven't l told you? Killing Mudbloods<br>doesn't matter to me anymore.
<SYNC Start=7645736><P Class=ENCC>
For many months now,<br>my new target has been you.
<SYNC Start=7650503><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7652009><P Class=ENCC>
How is it that a baby<br>with no extraordinary magical talent...
<SYNC Start=7655779><P Class=ENCC>
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard<br>of all time?
<SYNC Start=7658782><P Class=ENCC>
How did you escape with nothing<br>but a scar...
<SYNC Start=7661885><P Class=ENCC>
...while Lord Voldemort's powers<br>were destroyed?
<SYNC Start=7664454><P Class=ENCC>
Why do you care how l escaped?<br>Voldemort was after your time.
<SYNC Start=7668792><P Class=ENCC>
Voldemort is my past,<br>present and future.
<SYNC Start=7675254><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7695652><P Class=ENCC>
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
<SYNC Start=7699088><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7702259><P Class=ENCC>
- You're Voldemort.<br>- Surely you didn't think...
<SYNC Start=7706029><P Class=ENCC>
...l was going to keep<br>my filthy Muggle father's name?
<SYNC Start=7710701><P Class=ENCC>
No. l fashioned myself a new name,<br>a name l knew wizards everywhere...
<SYNC Start=7715038><P Class=ENCC>
...would one day fear to speak when l<br>became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
<SYNC Start=7719409><P Class=ENCC>
Albus Dumbledore<br>is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
<SYNC Start=7722779><P Class=ENCC>
Dumbledore's been driven out of<br>this castle by the mere memory of me.
<SYNC Start=7726350><P Class=ENCC>
He'll never be gone. Not as long as<br>those who remain are loyal to him.
<SYNC Start=7731413><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7737828><P Class=ENCC>
Fawkes?
<SYNC Start=7738817><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7755078><P Class=ENCC>
So this is what Dumbledore<br>sends his great defender.
<SYNC Start=7758815><P Class=ENCC>
A songbird and an old hat.
<SYNC Start=7762512><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7775799><P Class=ENCC>
Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort,<br>Heir of Salazar Slytherin...
<SYNC Start=7780504><P Class=ENCC>
...against the famous Harry Potter.
<SYNC Start=7784531><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7797888><P Class=ENCC>
Parseltongue won't save you now,<br>Potter. It only obeys me.
<SYNC Start=7802222><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7832456><P Class=ENCC>
No!
<SYNC Start=7834458><P Class=ENCC>
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,<br>but it can still hear you.
<SYNC Start=7838952><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7940931><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, Potter.<br>The process is nearly complete.
<SYNC Start=7944401><P Class=ENCC>
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be<br>dead, and l will cease to be a memory.
<SYNC Start=7949473><P Class=ENCC>
Lord Voldemort will return...
<SYNC Start=7952509><P Class=ENCC>
...very much alive.
<SYNC Start=7956741><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=7957481><P Class=ENCC>
Ginny?
<SYNC Start=7958880><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8095218><P Class=ENCC>
Remarkable, isn't it...
<SYNC Start=8096987><P Class=ENCC>
...how quickly the venom<br>of the basilisk penetrates the body?
<SYNC Start=8101091><P Class=ENCC>
l'd guess you have little more<br>than a minute to live.
<SYNC Start=8104094><P Class=ENCC>
You'll be with your dear<br>Mudblood mother soon, Harry.
<SYNC Start=8108121><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8113136><P Class=ENCC>
Funny, the damage a silly<br>little book can do...
<SYNC Start=8117007><P Class=ENCC>
...especially in the hands<br>of a silly little girl.
<SYNC Start=8122001><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8124914><P Class=ENCC>
What are you doing?
<SYNC Start=8126711><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8129552><P Class=ENCC>
Stop. No!
<SYNC Start=8131679><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8189979><P Class=ENCC>
It was me.<br>But l swear, l didn't mean to.
<SYNC Start=8194117><P Class=ENCC>
Riddle made me, and...
<SYNC Start=8197609><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8198154><P Class=ENCC>
Harry, you're hurt.
<SYNC Start=8201157><P Class=ENCC>
Don't worry.
<SYNC Start=8202826><P Class=ENCC>
Ginny, you need<br>to get yourself out.
<SYNC Start=8206629><P Class=ENCC>
Follow the Chamber<br>and you'll find Ron.
<SYNC Start=8209894><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8221978><P Class=ENCC>
You were brilliant, Fawkes.
<SYNC Start=8224105><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8225248><P Class=ENCC>
l just wasn't quick enough.
<SYNC Start=8227682><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8248471><P Class=ENCC>
Of course.
<SYNC Start=8250473><P Class=ENCC>
Phoenix tears have healing powers.
<SYNC Start=8253340><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8254978><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.
<SYNC Start=8256741><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8258481><P Class=ENCC>
It's all right, Ginny.
<SYNC Start=8260608><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8261785><P Class=ENCC>
It's over.
<SYNC Start=8263980><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8264988><P Class=ENCC>
It's just a memory.
<SYNC Start=8267479><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8270426><P Class=ENCC>
Amazing!<br>This is just like magic!
<SYNC Start=8275762><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8286976><P Class=ENCC>
You both realize, of course...
<SYNC Start=8289846><P Class=ENCC>
...that in the past few hours, you have<br>broken perhaps a dozen school rules.
<SYNC Start=8295307><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8296019><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=8297187><P Class=ENCC>
There is sufficient evidence<br>to have you both expelled.
<SYNC Start=8300590><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, sir.
<SYNC Start=8301958><P Class=ENCC>
Therefore, it is only fitting...
<SYNC Start=8304722><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8306262><P Class=ENCC>
...that you both receive...
<SYNC Start=8308526><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8309032><P Class=ENCC>
...Special Awards for Services<br>to the School.
<SYNC Start=8313128><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8315205><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks, sir.
<SYNC Start=8317070><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8317640><P Class=ENCC>
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...
<SYNC Start=8320109><P Class=ENCC>
...have an owl deliver these<br>release papers to Azkaban.
<SYNC Start=8324307><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8325415><P Class=ENCC>
l believe we want<br>our gamekeeper back.
<SYNC Start=8330182><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8335158><P Class=ENCC>
First, l want to thank you, Harry.
<SYNC Start=8339492><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8340063><P Class=ENCC>
You must have shown me<br>real loyalty down in the Chamber.
<SYNC Start=8343555><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8344434><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing but that<br>could have called Fawkes to you.
<SYNC Start=8348996><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8351407><P Class=ENCC>
And...
<SYNC Start=8352931><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8353543><P Class=ENCC>
...second...
<SYNC Start=8355144><P Class=ENCC>
...l sense that something<br>is troubling you.
<SYNC Start=8360149><P Class=ENCC>
Am l right, Harry?
<SYNC Start=8362617><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8364487><P Class=ENCC>
It's just...
<SYNC Start=8366216><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8367390><P Class=ENCC>
You see, sir, l couldn't help<br>but notice certain things, certain...
<SYNC Start=8372295><P Class=ENCC>
Certain similarities<br>between Tom Riddle and me.
<SYNC Start=8377927><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8378501><P Class=ENCC>
l see.
<SYNC Start=8379869><P Class=ENCC>
Well, you can speak<br>Parseltongue, Harry. Why?
<SYNC Start=8386109><P Class=ENCC>
Because Lord Voldemort<br>can speak Parseltongue.
<SYNC Start=8391638><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8392882><P Class=ENCC>
lf I'm not mistaken, Harry...
<SYNC Start=8396019><P Class=ENCC>
...he transferred<br>some of his powers to you...
<SYNC Start=8400023><P Class=ENCC>
...the night he gave you that scar.
<SYNC Start=8403126><P Class=ENCC>
Voldemort transferred<br>some of his powers to me?
<SYNC Start=8407028><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8408932><P Class=ENCC>
Not intentionally...
<SYNC Start=8411628><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8412535><P Class=ENCC>
...but yes.
<SYNC Start=8414435><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8416372><P Class=ENCC>
So the Sorting Hat was right.<br>l should be in Slytherin.
<SYNC Start=8419842><P Class=ENCC>
It's true. You possess many of the<br>qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
<SYNC Start=8424881><P Class=ENCC>
Determination, resourcefulness...
<SYNC Start=8427917><P Class=ENCC>
...and if l may say so,<br>a certain disregard for the rules.
<SYNC Start=8431910><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8432588><P Class=ENCC>
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat<br>place you in Gryffindor?
<SYNC Start=8436581><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8437393><P Class=ENCC>
- Because l asked it to.<br>- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.
<SYNC Start=8441264><P Class=ENCC>
Which makes you different<br>from Voldemort.
<SYNC Start=8443499><P Class=ENCC>
It is not our abilities<br>that show what we truly are.
<SYNC Start=8447670><P Class=ENCC>
It is our choices.
<SYNC Start=8449797><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8453476><P Class=ENCC>
lf you want proof<br>why you belong in Gryffindor...
<SYNC Start=8457080><P Class=ENCC>
...then l suggest<br>you look more closely at this.
<SYNC Start=8461881><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8462885><P Class=ENCC>
Be careful.
<SYNC Start=8464580><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8470226><P Class=ENCC>
Godric Gryffindor.
<SYNC Start=8473062><P Class=ENCC>
It would take a true Gryffindor<br>to pull that out of the hat.
<SYNC Start=8477158><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8486042><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby.
<SYNC Start=8487441><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8488745><P Class=ENCC>
So this is your master.<br>The family you serve is the Malfoys.
<SYNC Start=8493114><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8495318><P Class=ENCC>
I'll deal with you later.
<SYNC Start=8498651><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8504494><P Class=ENCC>
Out of my way, Potter.
<SYNC Start=8506262><P Class=ENCC>
So it's true. You have returned.
<SYNC Start=8509857><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8510533><P Class=ENCC>
When the governors learned that<br>Arthur Weasley's daughter...
<SYNC Start=8513469><P Class=ENCC>
...was taken into the Chamber,<br>they saw fit to summon me back.
<SYNC Start=8517667><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8518508><P Class=ENCC>
- Ridiculous.<br>- Curiously, Lucius, several of them...
<SYNC Start=8522712><P Class=ENCC>
...were under the impression<br>that you would curse their family...
<SYNC Start=8526549><P Class=ENCC>
...if they did not agree<br>to suspend me in the first place.
<SYNC Start=8529852><P Class=ENCC>
- How dare you!<br>- Beg your pardon?
<SYNC Start=8533489><P Class=ENCC>
My sole concern has always been<br>and will always be...
<SYNC Start=8537427><P Class=ENCC>
...the welfare of this school...
<SYNC Start=8540430><P Class=ENCC>
...and, of course, its students.
<SYNC Start=8544730><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8548771><P Class=ENCC>
The culprit has been identified,<br>l presume?
<SYNC Start=8553409><P Class=ENCC>
Yes.
<SYNC Start=8554899><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8556512><P Class=ENCC>
And?
<SYNC Start=8558343><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8559515><P Class=ENCC>
Who was it?
<SYNC Start=8561540><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8567990><P Class=ENCC>
Voldemort.
<SYNC Start=8570550><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8571694><P Class=ENCC>
Only this time he chose to act<br>through somebody else...
<SYNC Start=8577155><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8577700><P Class=ENCC>
...by means of this.
<SYNC Start=8581261><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8583940><P Class=ENCC>
l see.
<SYNC Start=8585464><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8586976><P Class=ENCC>
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter<br>discovered it.
<SYNC Start=8591547><P Class=ENCC>
One hopes that no more of Lord<br>Voldemort's old school-things...
<SYNC Start=8595384><P Class=ENCC>
...should find their way<br>into innocent hands.
<SYNC Start=8598955><P Class=ENCC>
The consequences for the one<br>responsible would be...
<SYNC Start=8603259><P Class=ENCC>
...severe.
<SYNC Start=8605124><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8606529><P Class=ENCC>
Well, let us hope...
<SYNC Start=8609499><P Class=ENCC>
...that Mr. Potter will always<br>be around to save the day.
<SYNC Start=8615028><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8615805><P Class=ENCC>
Don't worry. l will be.
<SYNC Start=8619571><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8628351><P Class=ENCC>
Dumbledore.
<SYNC Start=8630342><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8631521><P Class=ENCC>
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
<SYNC Start=8635048><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8652308><P Class=ENCC>
Sir?<br>l wonder if l could have that?
<SYNC Start=8656711><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8663186><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Malfoy.
<SYNC Start=8664954><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Malfoy!
<SYNC Start=8667623><P Class=ENCC>
l have something of yours.
<SYNC Start=8669784><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8671460><P Class=ENCC>
Mine? l don't know<br>what you're talking about.
<SYNC Start=8674630><P Class=ENCC>
l think you do, sir.
<SYNC Start=8676332><P Class=ENCC>
l think you slipped the diary<br>into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...
<SYNC Start=8679602><P Class=ENCC>
...that day at Diagon Alley.
<SYNC Start=8681035><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8681737><P Class=ENCC>
You do, do you?
<SYNC Start=8684262><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8691681><P Class=ENCC>
Why don't you prove it?
<SYNC Start=8694741><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8700923><P Class=ENCC>
Come, Dobby.
<SYNC Start=8703084><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8704393><P Class=ENCC>
Open it.
<SYNC Start=8706418><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8709966><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby.
<SYNC Start=8711667><P Class=ENCC>
Master has given Dobby a sock.
<SYNC Start=8715104><P Class=ENCC>
What? l didn't give--
<SYNC Start=8717406><P Class=ENCC>
Master has presented Dobby<br>with clothes.
<SYNC Start=8721277><P Class=ENCC>
Dobby is free.
<SYNC Start=8724303><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8730886><P Class=ENCC>
You lost me my servant!
<SYNC Start=8734617><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8741597><P Class=ENCC>
You shall not harm Harry Potter.
<SYNC Start=8745590><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8757780><P Class=ENCC>
Your parents were<br>meddlesome fools too.
<SYNC Start=8761584><P Class=ENCC>
Mark my words, Potter.<br>One day soon...
<SYNC Start=8764920><P Class=ENCC>
...you are going to meet<br>the same sticky end.
<SYNC Start=8770119><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8775831><P Class=ENCC>
Harry Potter freed Dobby.<br>How can Dobby ever repay him?
<SYNC Start=8782104><P Class=ENCC>
- Just promise me something.<br>- Anything, sir.
<SYNC Start=8786336><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8788311><P Class=ENCC>
Never try to save my life again.
<SYNC Start=8790802><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8796952><P Class=ENCC>
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.<br>- Thank you.
<SYNC Start=8800256><P Class=ENCC>
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.<br>- Good evening.
<SYNC Start=8802792><P Class=ENCC>
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.<br>- Thank you.
<SYNC Start=8805693><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8807096><P Class=ENCC>
Hello.
<SYNC Start=8809291><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8811000><P Class=ENCC>
- Hermione! Welcome back.<br>- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.
<SYNC Start=8815630><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8818874><P Class=ENCC>
Harry. It's Hermione.
<SYNC Start=8822173><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8849004><P Class=ENCC>
- Welcome back, Hermione.<br>- It's good to be back.
<SYNC Start=8852908><P Class=ENCC>
Congratulations.<br>l can't believe you solved it.
<SYNC Start=8855678><P Class=ENCC>
We had loads of help from you.
<SYNC Start=8858114><P Class=ENCC>
- We couldn't have done it without you.<br>- Thanks.
<SYNC Start=8861311><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8863185><P Class=ENCC>
Could l have your attention, please?
<SYNC Start=8866154><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8870292><P Class=ENCC>
Before we begin the feast...
<SYNC Start=8872995><P Class=ENCC>
...let us have a round of applause<br>for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...
<SYNC Start=8879402><P Class=ENCC>
...whose Mandrake juice has been<br>so successfully administered...
<SYNC Start=8883672><P Class=ENCC>
...to all who had been Petrified.
<SYNC Start=8886300><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8896852><P Class=ENCC>
Also, in light of the recent events...
<SYNC Start=8900022><P Class=ENCC>
...as a school treat...
<SYNC Start=8902358><P Class=ENCC>
...all exams have been canceled.
<SYNC Start=8906317><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8908998><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, no.
<SYNC Start=8910556><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8927550><P Class=ENCC>
Sorry I'm late.
<SYNC Start=8929541><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8935624><P Class=ENCC>
The owl that delivered my release papers<br>got all lost and confused.
<SYNC Start=8940296><P Class=ENCC>
Some ruddy bird called Errol.
<SYNC Start=8943595><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8959415><P Class=ENCC>
And l'd just like to say that if it hadn't<br>been for you, Harry and Ron...
<SYNC Start=8965588><P Class=ENCC>
...and Hermione, of course...
<SYNC Start=8968523><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=8969191><P Class=ENCC>
...l would still be you-know-where...
<SYNC Start=8973462><P Class=ENCC>
...so l'd just like to say thanks.
<SYNC Start=8977023><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
