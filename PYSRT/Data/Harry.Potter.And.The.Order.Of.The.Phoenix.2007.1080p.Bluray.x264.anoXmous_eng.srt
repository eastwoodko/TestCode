1
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:56,929
<i>I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?</i>

2
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,433
<i>And it's going to get even Worse.
Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius...</i>

3
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:05,312
<i>that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.</i>

4
00:01:05,313 --> 00:01:08,148
<i>So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...</i>

5
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:11,151
<i>with the hottest hits on your FM dial.</i>

6
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:14,655
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:18,742
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:22,788
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:27,084
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:27,085 --> 00:01:28,919
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,631
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:35,342
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:35,343 --> 00:01:37,135
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:37,136 --> 00:01:40,222
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:40,223 --> 00:01:44,643
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:49,644
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:55,320
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:58,323
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:58,324 --> 00:02:02,744
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:02,745 --> 00:02:05,831
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:08,917
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,837
She dead?

23
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:14,006
Is she dead?

24
00:02:14,007 --> 00:02:19,007
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:34,276
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:34,277 --> 00:02:36,278
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:39,406
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:44,407
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:36,292
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:13,913
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

31
00:04:40,153 --> 00:04:45,153
Mrs. Figg-

32
00:04:45,825 --> 00:04:48,201
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:51,872
They might come back.

34
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:55,000
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:59,129
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,506
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:01,507 --> 00:05:05,051
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:05,052 --> 00:05:09,055
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:11,892
did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:11,893 --> 00:05:14,728
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:18,023
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:23,024
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:34,664
<i>It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.</i>

44
00:05:34,665 --> 00:05:36,958
<i>There's sweet. There's stifling.</i>

45
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,211
Diddykins?

46
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:44,212
Is that you?

47
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:48,345
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:48,346 --> 00:05:50,931
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:50,932 --> 00:05:55,932
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,565
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:03,401
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,404
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:11,076
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Cur boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:13,245
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:18,246
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:33,265
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:38,266
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:43,650
you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:45,861
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:50,115
of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:52,659
you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,830
from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:56,831 --> 00:07:01,831
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:05,881
Jusüce.

65
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,979
He's not very well.

66
00:07:34,702 --> 00:07:39,702
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,855
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:50,856
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:52,697 --> 00:08:54,698
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:59,699
- What are you doing here?
- Resouing you, of course.

71
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:03,498
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:06,084
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:07,293
But the letter said...

74
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:10,463
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:10,464 --> 00:09:12,799
- ...pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,344
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:18,805
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:18,806 --> 00:09:23,806
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:32,982
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,997
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:26,542
Come on.

82
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:10,208
In you go, son.

83
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:11,876
There've been no Sightings.

84
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:13,753
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:16,798
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

86
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,799
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:25,598
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:11:25,599 --> 00:11:30,186
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:33,565
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.

90
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:36,901
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your Voices down.

91
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:41,902
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:50,248
- Harm.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:55,249
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:56,255 --> 00:12:00,133
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:12:00,134 --> 00:12:05,134
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,350
Yeah.

97
00:12:09,351 --> 00:12:14,351
Mudblood, werewolves,
traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:19,732
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:23,114
what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:12:23,115 --> 00:12:28,115
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:41,424
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:44,969
<i>Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.</i>

103
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,970
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:51,644 --> 00:12:55,897
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:55,898 --> 00:12:59,901
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:59,902 --> 00:13:02,904
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:07,283
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

108
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:09,619
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,830
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:17,335
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:19,462
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:19,463 --> 00:13:22,966
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,592
It's a secret society.

114
00:13:24,593 --> 00:13:27,345
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:13:27,346 --> 00:13:30,598
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:33,393
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:37,188
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

118
00:13:37,189 --> 00:13:38,398
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,399
Cnly Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:43,404 --> 00:13:46,906
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:49,826
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,953
I'm the one
who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:54,956
the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,333
- Harm.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:57,334 --> 00:14:01,546
- Don't bottle it up, though. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...

126
00:14:01,547 --> 00:14:05,383
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:05,384 --> 00:14:08,886
<i>If anyone has</i> a <i>right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry...</i>

128
00:14:08,887 --> 00:14:11,097
<i>we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.</i>

129
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:12,849
<i>He's not a child, Mol/y.</i>

130
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:15,518
<i>But he's not an adult either.</i>

131
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,604
<i>- He's not James, Sir/us.
- Well, he's not your son.</i>

132
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:21,149
<i>He's as good as.</i>

133
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,026
<i>- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.</i>

134
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:25,611
<i>- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.</i>

135
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:28,906
<i>Perhaps Potter will grow up
to be a fe/on, just like his godfather.</i>

136
00:14:28,907 --> 00:14:30,825
<i>Now, you stay out of this, Snivel/us.</i>

137
00:14:30,826 --> 00:14:33,077
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:35,079
<i>About your supposed reformation.</i>

139
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,999
<i>- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?</i>

140
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,876
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:41,919
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,255
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:48,468
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:48,469 --> 00:14:53,389
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,976
Well, we'll be eating
down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:59,479
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

147
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,690
does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:05,276
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:07,153
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:09,947
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:14,327
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:14,828
Sirius.

153
00:15:21,877 --> 00:15:24,295
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:28,132
It seems your hearing at the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:32,512
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:37,513
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:51,155
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:56,156
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the <i>Daily</i> Prophet...

159
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:59,664
to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:01,124
Why?

161
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,251
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:05,545
No one in their right mind
could believe that...

163
00:16:05,546 --> 00:16:08,589
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,802
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:15,388
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:18,015
The last time
Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:21,519
he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,606
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:29,819
to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,820
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

171
00:16:35,617 --> 00:16:38,453
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:43,454
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:48,588
He's been recruiting heavily, and we've
been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:53,589
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:55,304 --> 00:16:58,097
We believe...

176
00:16:58,098 --> 00:17:00,224
Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:00,725
Sirius.

178
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,317
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:17:09,318 --> 00:17:11,527
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:11,528 --> 00:17:15,740
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:18,743
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

182
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:23,744
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,053
<i>Harry.</i>

184
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:39,472
<i>You are hereby expel/ed.</i>

185
00:17:39,473 --> 00:17:44,473
<i>Before the entire Wizengamot.</i>

186
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,569
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:58,570
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:16,676
Here we are.

189
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:21,677
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

190
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:26,848
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:09,270
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:12,732
<i>Daily</i> Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for <i>Daily</i> Prophet?

193
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:17,733
Dumbledore: Ls he daft,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:42,716
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,889
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,890
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:57,526
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:57,527 --> 00:19:59,570
They've changed the time
of your hearing.

199
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:01,364
When is it?

200
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:06,365
In five minutes.

201
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:15,916
<i>Department of Mysteries.</i>

202
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:20,966
And I'm Confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

203
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:25,967
Yes, but we must be...

204
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:33,813
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

205
00:20:33,814 --> 00:20:37,650
Keep calm.
You've done nothing wrong.

206
00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:41,445
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

207
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:43,948
Yes?

208
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:47,910
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

209
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:52,911
Good luck, Harry.

210
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,293
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

211
00:20:56,294 --> 00:20:59,422
into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

212
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:03,217
resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

213
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:06,470
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...

214
00:21:06,471 --> 00:21:08,472
Witness for the defense.

215
00:21:08,473 --> 00:21:11,976
Albus Percival Wulfric...

216
00:21:11,977 --> 00:21:15,688
Brian Dumbledore.

217
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:19,150
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

218
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:21,861
- ...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

219
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:26,862
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

220
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:30,161
The Charges?

221
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:32,830
The Charges against the accused
are as follows:

222
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:34,665
"That he did knowingly..."

223
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,377
and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

224
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:41,547
produce a Patronus Charm...

225
00:21:41,548 --> 00:21:44,967
"...in the presence of a Muggle."

226
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:48,429
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

227
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,057
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

228
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:55,102
- ...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

229
00:21:55,103 --> 00:21:58,647
Witches and wizards
of the Wizengamot...

230
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:03,611
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

231
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:05,863
Dementors?

232
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:07,698
In Little Whinging?

233
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:10,201
That's quite clever.

234
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:13,621
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

235
00:22:13,622 --> 00:22:15,915
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

236
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:18,667
- There were two of them, if I hadn't...
- Enough.

237
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:23,047
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure
would be a very well-rehearsed story...

238
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:27,718
but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

239
00:22:27,719 --> 00:22:32,719
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

240
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:40,644
Please describe the attack.

241
00:22:41,525 --> 00:22:43,901
What did they look like?

242
00:22:43,902 --> 00:22:48,902
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

243
00:22:50,408 --> 00:22:53,410
Not the boys. The Dementors.

244
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:58,249
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

245
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:03,250
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

246
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:07,091
as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

247
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:12,092
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

248
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:16,141
and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

249
00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:18,060
I don't think anyone would believe...

250
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:23,061
the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

251
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:26,652
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

252
00:23:26,653 --> 00:23:31,653
Dementors are, after all, under
the control of the Ministry of Magic.

253
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:36,704
And it's so silly of me, but it sounded
for a moment as though...

254
00:23:36,705 --> 00:23:40,875
you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

255
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:43,836
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

256
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:48,173
which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiw...

257
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:51,719
into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

258
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,973
and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

259
00:23:55,974 --> 00:23:58,517
Of course, there is someone...

260
00:23:58,518 --> 00:24:03,518
who might be behind the attack.

261
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:08,944
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

262
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:13,657
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

263
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:18,658
He is not back.

264
00:24:22,334 --> 00:24:25,127
In the matter of Harry Potter...

265
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:27,796
the law clearly states...

266
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:32,343
that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

267
00:24:32,344 --> 00:24:35,429
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

268
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,766
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full Criminal trial...

269
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:43,767
to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

270
00:24:50,028 --> 00:24:55,028
Those in favor of conviction?

271
00:25:02,415 --> 00:25:07,415
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all Charges?

272
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:26,476
Cleared of all Charges.

273
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:31,773
Professor.

274
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:44,707
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

275
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:49,708
You'll blow the entire operation.

276
00:25:55,427 --> 00:25:58,262
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...

277
00:25:58,263 --> 00:26:02,683
I had to see you off, didn't I?

278
00:26:02,684 --> 00:26:05,394
What's life without a little risk?

279
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:07,896
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

280
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:09,773
Don't worry about me.

281
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:14,774
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

282
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,746
Original Order of the Phoenix.

283
00:26:23,747 --> 00:26:25,622
Marlene McKinnon.

284
00:26:25,623 --> 00:26:28,584
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

285
00:26:28,585 --> 00:26:32,171
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

286
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:34,131
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

287
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:35,799
Neville's parents.

288
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,800
They suffered a fate Worse than death,
you ask me.

289
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:44,725
It's been 14 years.

290
00:26:44,726 --> 00:26:49,726
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

291
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,610
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

292
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:03,948
It feels like it did before.

293
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:08,499
You keep it.

294
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

295
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,091
I'll see you at the train.

296
00:27:17,092 --> 00:27:20,010
Bye-bye, darling.

297
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:22,262
I love you.

298
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:24,515
Hold my hand, lovey.

299
00:27:24,516 --> 00:27:26,975
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

300
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:27,476
Bye.

301
00:28:10,436 --> 00:28:13,564
I'm Surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

302
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:15,232
Better enjoy it while you can.

303
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:20,233
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

304
00:28:21,114 --> 00:28:26,114
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

305
00:28:26,286 --> 00:28:28,954
It's only Malfoy.

306
00:28:28,955 --> 00:28:33,955
What'd you expect?

307
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:52,102
Hi, guys.

308
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:57,103
- Hey, Nevme.
- Hey there, Neville.

309
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:10,537
What is it?

310
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:14,625
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

311
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:17,586
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

312
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:22,587
It's pulling itself, like always.

313
00:29:33,436 --> 00:29:38,232
You're not going mad.

314
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:41,735
I can see them too.

315
00:29:41,736 --> 00:29:46,736
You're just as sane as I am.

316
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,997
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

317
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:58,998
Luna Lovegood.

318
00:29:59,837 --> 00:30:02,714
What an interesting necklace.

319
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:06,260
It's a charm, actually.

320
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:11,261
Keeps away the Nargles.

321
00:30:11,641 --> 00:30:13,809
Hungry-

322
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:16,770
I hope there's pudding.

323
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:21,771
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

324
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:35,998
Good evening, children.

325
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:38,875
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

326
00:30:38,876 --> 00:30:42,087
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

327
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:44,840
who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

328
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:49,136
while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

329
00:30:49,137 --> 00:30:53,307
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

330
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:56,768
Professor Dolores Umbridge.

331
00:30:56,769 --> 00:31:01,315
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

332
00:31:01,316 --> 00:31:06,316
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

333
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:20,292
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

334
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:25,293
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

335
00:31:27,383 --> 00:31:31,219
And how lovely to see all your bright...

336
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,431
happy faces smiling up at me.

337
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:39,432
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

338
00:31:39,771 --> 00:31:44,771
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

339
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:47,986
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

340
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:52,987
the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

341
00:31:53,951 --> 00:31:56,411
Although each headmaster...

342
00:31:56,412 --> 00:32:01,412
has brought something new
to this historic school...

343
00:32:02,794 --> 00:32:07,794
progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

344
00:32:09,675 --> 00:32:13,678
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

345
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,349
perfect what can be perfected...

346
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:22,350
and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

347
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:35,325
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

348
00:32:35,326 --> 00:32:40,326
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

349
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:42,749
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

350
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,750
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

351
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:08,150
Dean, Seamus.

352
00:33:08,151 --> 00:33:10,652
- Good holiday?
- All right.

353
00:33:10,653 --> 00:33:14,197
Better than Seamus', anyway.

354
00:33:14,198 --> 00:33:16,700
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

355
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:20,412
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

356
00:33:20,413 --> 00:33:23,957
The <i>Daily</i> Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

357
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,459
What, your mum believes them?

358
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,544
Nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

359
00:33:27,545 --> 00:33:30,797
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.

360
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:34,468
Don't talk about my mother. - I'll
have a go at anyone Calling me a liar.

361
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:37,137
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

362
00:33:37,138 --> 00:33:40,390
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

363
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:43,059
Yeah. I do.

364
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

365
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:57,032
- You all right?
- Fine.

366
00:33:57,033 --> 00:34:00,410
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

367
00:34:00,411 --> 00:34:05,411
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

368
00:34:07,835 --> 00:34:12,835
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

369
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,160
<i>Harry.</i>

370
00:34:57,134 --> 00:35:00,220
Bring it over here. Over here.

371
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:05,221
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

372
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:22,158
Good morning, children.

373
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,159
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

374
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:30,250
O-W-Ls.

375
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:35,005
More commonly known as OWLs.

376
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:38,466
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

377
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:43,467
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

378
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:54,312
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

379
00:35:54,525 --> 00:35:56,860
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

380
00:35:56,861 --> 00:36:00,530
you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

381
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:04,534
course of defensive magic. Yes?

382
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:07,329
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

383
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,039
Using spells?

384
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

385
00:36:14,211 --> 00:36:15,962
We're not gonna use magic?

386
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:20,963
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a Secure, risk-free way.

387
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:24,054
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

388
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:29,055
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

389
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:33,229
It is the view of the Ministry...

390
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,149
that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

391
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,276
to get you through
your examinations...

392
00:36:38,277 --> 00:36:40,904
which, after all,
is what school is all about.

393
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:43,865
And how's theory supposed
to prepare us for what's out there?

394
00:36:43,866 --> 00:36:46,076
There is nothing out there, dear.

395
00:36:46,077 --> 00:36:49,245
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

396
00:36:49,246 --> 00:36:54,246
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Lord Voldemort.

397
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:08,219
Now, let me make this quite plain.

398
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:09,891
You have been told...

399
00:37:09,892 --> 00:37:14,892
that a certain dark Wizard
is at large once again.

400
00:37:15,439 --> 00:37:20,439
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

401
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:22,529
Detention, Mr. Potter.

402
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,864
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

403
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:27,450
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

404
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:29,786
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

405
00:37:29,787 --> 00:37:31,955
Enough!

406
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:33,790
Enough.

407
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:38,791
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

408
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:03,406
Come in.

409
00:38:09,326 --> 00:38:11,870
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

410
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:12,371
Sit.

411
00:38:20,838 --> 00:38:24,924
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

412
00:38:24,925 --> 00:38:27,010
No, not with your quill.

413
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:32,011
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

414
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:37,729
Now...

415
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:42,730
I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

416
00:38:45,696 --> 00:38:48,031
How many times?

417
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:53,032
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

418
00:38:54,705 --> 00:38:56,539
You haven't given me any ink.

419
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:01,540
Oh, you won't need any ink.

420
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,760
Yes?

421
00:39:58,102 --> 00:40:02,397
- Nothing.
- That's right.

422
00:40:02,398 --> 00:40:06,526
Because you know, deep down...

423
00:40:06,527 --> 00:40:09,779
you deserve to be punished.

424
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,780
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

425
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:16,661
Go on.

426
00:40:26,797 --> 00:40:29,257
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

427
00:40:29,258 --> 00:40:31,050
Get out of class whenever you like.

428
00:40:31,051 --> 00:40:35,805
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

429
00:40:35,806 --> 00:40:37,307
Care for another?

430
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:40,018
- I'm not asking you to write all of it.
- Please.

431
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:43,479
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

432
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,440
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

433
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:49,360
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

434
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:54,361
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

435
00:40:58,662 --> 00:41:01,289
What's wrong with your hand?

436
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:04,000
Nothing.

437
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:08,421
The other hand.

438
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:10,423
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

439
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:12,800
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

440
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:15,094
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

441
00:41:15,095 --> 00:41:17,680
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

442
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:22,681
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

443
00:41:24,438 --> 00:41:27,065
Harry, you've got to report this.

444
00:41:27,066 --> 00:41:30,777
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

445
00:41:30,778 --> 00:41:34,656
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

446
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:39,285
You don't understand.

447
00:41:39,286 --> 00:41:44,286
Then help us to.

448
00:41:55,928 --> 00:41:58,346
<i>Dear Padfoot.</i> ..

449
00:41:58,347 --> 00:42:00,223
<i>I hope you're all right.</i>

450
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:05,224
<i>It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.</i>

451
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:12,481
<i>In spite of being back at Hogwarfs,
I feel more alone than ever.</i>

452
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:18,070
<i>/know you, of all people,
will understand.</i>

453
00:42:50,482 --> 00:42:55,319
Hello, Harry Potter.

454
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,320
- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.

455
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:05,455
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

456
00:43:05,456 --> 00:43:10,456
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

457
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:19,177
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

458
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:24,178
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

459
00:43:27,186 --> 00:43:31,939
Different.

460
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,484
But why can't the others see them?

461
00:43:34,485 --> 00:43:39,485
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

462
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:42,909
So you've known someone
Who's died, then?

463
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,078
My mum.

464
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:50,079
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

465
00:43:50,167 --> 00:43:53,628
and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

466
00:43:53,629 --> 00:43:56,589
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

467
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,966
Yes, it was rather horrible.

468
00:43:58,967 --> 00:44:03,967
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

469
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:11,517
We both believe you, by the way.

470
00:44:12,231 --> 00:44:15,399
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

471
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,694
and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

472
00:44:18,695 --> 00:44:23,199
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

473
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,911
I don't think that's true.

474
00:44:26,912 --> 00:44:30,206
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

475
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:32,625
What do you mean?

476
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:34,961
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

477
00:44:34,962 --> 00:44:38,714
I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

478
00:44:38,715 --> 00:44:42,260
because if it's just you alone...

479
00:44:42,261 --> 00:44:47,261
you're not as much of a threat.

480
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,239
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

481
00:45:10,372 --> 00:45:13,249
Harry.

482
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:16,419
Can I join you?

483
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,714
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

484
00:45:19,715 --> 00:45:22,633
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

485
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:27,096
you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

486
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,931
So silly of me, but it Sounds...

487
00:45:28,932 --> 00:45:33,227
as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

488
00:45:33,228 --> 00:45:34,729
Minerva.

489
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:39,442
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

490
00:45:39,443 --> 00:45:42,111
I am sorry, dear.

491
00:45:42,112 --> 00:45:45,615
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

492
00:45:45,616 --> 00:45:48,910
and by extension,
the minister himself.

493
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:50,661
I am a tolerant woman...

494
00:45:50,662 --> 00:45:55,662
but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

495
00:45:57,502 --> 00:46:01,005
Disloyalty.

496
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:05,134
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

497
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:10,135
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

498
00:46:20,025 --> 00:46:22,109
What's happened to Dumbledore?

499
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,820
<i>Ha ving already revolutionized.</i> ..

500
00:46:24,821 --> 00:46:29,158
<i>The teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...</i>

501
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:34,159
<i>Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...</i>

502
00:46:35,165 --> 00:46:40,165
to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

503
00:46:47,094 --> 00:46:49,428
Just one question, dear.

504
00:46:49,429 --> 00:46:54,429
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

505
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,440
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

506
00:47:05,696 --> 00:47:08,114
Yes.

507
00:47:08,115 --> 00:47:11,951
But you were unsuccessful?

508
00:47:11,952 --> 00:47:16,952
Obviously.

509
00:47:46,737 --> 00:47:51,737
Could you please predict something
for me?

510
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:56,908
I'm sorry?

511
00:47:58,332 --> 00:48:03,332
Move those mouths.

512
00:48:06,673 --> 00:48:11,673
One teensy little prophecy?

513
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,641
Pity.

514
00:48:17,642 --> 00:48:20,227
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

515
00:48:20,228 --> 00:48:22,688
Yes, I do. Something dark.

516
00:48:22,689 --> 00:48:27,689
You are in grave danger.

517
00:48:28,695 --> 00:48:29,195
Lovely.

518
00:48:40,624 --> 00:48:42,958
Cho. What's going on?

519
00:48:42,959 --> 00:48:47,959
It's Professor Trelawney.

520
00:49:15,117 --> 00:49:18,786
Sixteen years I've lived
and taught here.

521
00:49:18,787 --> 00:49:23,624
Hogwarts is my home.

522
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:26,961
You can't do this.

523
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:31,962
Actually, I can.

524
00:49:38,098 --> 00:49:39,640
Something you'd like to say?

525
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:42,852
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

526
00:49:42,853 --> 00:49:43,397
There...

527
00:49:58,368 --> 00:50:03,368
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

528
00:50:04,332 --> 00:50:06,959
Sybil, dear. This way.

529
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,628
Thank you.

530
00:50:09,629 --> 00:50:13,841
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

531
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:17,261
of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister...

532
00:50:17,262 --> 00:50:20,598
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

533
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:24,351
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

534
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:29,352
That power remains
with the headmaster.

535
00:50:29,399 --> 00:50:29,943
For now.

536
00:50:37,073 --> 00:50:39,241
Don't you all have studying to do?

537
00:50:39,242 --> 00:50:42,244
Professor.

538
00:50:42,245 --> 00:50:43,829
Professor?

539
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:46,790
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

540
00:50:46,791 --> 00:50:51,791
Professor Dumbledore.

541
00:50:59,596 --> 00:51:02,264
<i>That foul, evil, old gargoyle.</i>

542
00:51:02,265 --> 00:51:04,600
We're not learning
how to defend ourselves.

543
00:51:04,601 --> 00:51:07,645
We're not learning
how to pass our OWLs.

544
00:51:07,646 --> 00:51:09,855
She's taking over the entire school.

545
00:51:09,856 --> 00:51:14,693
<i>Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.</i>

546
00:51:14,694 --> 00:51:17,696
<i>Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...</i>

547
00:51:17,697 --> 00:51:20,741
<i>that these disappearances
are the</i> work...

548
00:51:20,742 --> 00:51:24,870
of <i>notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.</i>

549
00:51:24,871 --> 00:51:26,664
Harry.

550
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:29,124
Sirius.

551
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,961
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

552
00:51:31,962 --> 00:51:35,047
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

553
00:51:35,048 --> 00:51:37,132
Training you to kill half-breeds?

554
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:40,469
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not Surprised.

555
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:44,682
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in Combat.

556
00:51:44,683 --> 00:51:46,225
Combat?

557
00:51:46,226 --> 00:51:49,311
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of Wizard army?

558
00:51:49,312 --> 00:51:50,854
That's exactly what he thinks.

559
00:51:50,855 --> 00:51:55,317
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

560
00:51:55,318 --> 00:51:58,988
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

561
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:02,992
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

562
00:52:02,993 --> 00:52:05,995
but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

563
00:52:05,996 --> 00:52:08,831
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

564
00:52:08,832 --> 00:52:13,627
and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

565
00:52:13,628 --> 00:52:17,339
Voldemort is on the move.

566
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:19,341
Well, what can we do?

567
00:52:19,342 --> 00:52:20,968
Someone's coming.

568
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:23,345
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

569
00:52:23,346 --> 00:52:28,346
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

570
00:52:39,863 --> 00:52:44,033
He really is out there, isn't he?

571
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:47,286
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

572
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:52,287
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us
how, we need someone who will.

573
00:53:08,058 --> 00:53:08,558
<i>Harry.</i>

574
00:53:19,819 --> 00:53:22,363
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

575
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:23,739
I'm a nutter, remember?

576
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:28,494
Look on the bright side: You can't be
any Worse than old toad face.

577
00:53:28,495 --> 00:53:32,456
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

578
00:53:32,457 --> 00:53:34,958
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

579
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:39,959
Just a couple of people.

580
00:53:42,092 --> 00:53:47,092
Lovely spot.

581
00:53:47,263 --> 00:53:49,556
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

582
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:54,557
Matey, come back here.

583
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:01,735
Hi.

584
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:04,780
So you all know why we're here.

585
00:54:04,781 --> 00:54:07,741
We need a teacher.

586
00:54:07,742 --> 00:54:10,202
A proper teacher.

587
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:13,539
One Who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

588
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,457
- Why?
- Why?

589
00:54:15,458 --> 00:54:17,710
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

590
00:54:17,711 --> 00:54:19,461
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

591
00:54:19,462 --> 00:54:21,755
So Dumbledore says because he says.

592
00:54:21,756 --> 00:54:25,509
The point is, where's the proof?

593
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:30,510
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

594
00:54:31,641 --> 00:54:35,602
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

595
00:54:35,603 --> 00:54:39,189
Come on, Hermione. They're here
because they think I'm some freak.

596
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:44,190
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

597
00:54:45,155 --> 00:54:48,031
Yes.

598
00:54:48,032 --> 00:54:49,658
I've seen it.

599
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:52,453
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

600
00:54:52,454 --> 00:54:56,749
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

601
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,167
It's true.

602
00:54:58,168 --> 00:55:02,171
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

603
00:55:02,172 --> 00:55:05,174
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

604
00:55:05,175 --> 00:55:07,176
Wait.

605
00:55:07,177 --> 00:55:11,889
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

606
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,726
but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

607
00:55:15,727 --> 00:55:19,646
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

608
00:55:19,647 --> 00:55:24,647
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

609
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:30,695
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

610
00:55:31,409 --> 00:55:35,037
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

611
00:55:35,038 --> 00:55:37,122
But out there...

612
00:55:37,123 --> 00:55:40,584
when you're a second away
from being murdered...

613
00:55:40,585 --> 00:55:45,585
or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

614
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:52,050
You don't know what that's like.

615
00:55:58,645 --> 00:56:01,313
You're right, Harry, we don't.

616
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:03,565
That's why we need your help.

617
00:56:03,566 --> 00:56:08,566
Because if we're going to have
any Chance at beating...

618
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:13,283
Voldemort...

619
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:18,284
He's really back?

620
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:39,184
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

621
00:56:39,185 --> 00:56:40,769
where Umbridge won't find out.

622
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,105
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

623
00:56:43,106 --> 00:56:46,233
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

624
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:48,485
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

625
00:56:48,486 --> 00:56:50,279
Who cares?

626
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,280
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

627
00:56:55,285 --> 00:56:58,287
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

628
00:56:58,288 --> 00:57:02,124
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

629
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:05,127
What's that?

630
00:57:05,128 --> 00:57:10,128
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

631
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:13,802
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

632
00:57:13,803 --> 00:57:16,805
with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

633
00:57:16,806 --> 00:57:20,809
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no Chance she can find us.

634
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:25,810
Will do, Harry.

635
00:57:31,362 --> 00:57:35,657
<i>Al/ student Organizations
are henceforth disbanded.</i>

636
00:57:35,658 --> 00:57:39,494
<i>Any student in noncompliance
will be expel/ed.</i>

637
00:57:39,495 --> 00:57:44,495
Watch where you're going,
Longbottom.

638
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:22,079
<i>You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.</i>

639
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,372
<i>The what?</i>

640
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:25,958
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

641
00:58:25,959 --> 00:58:29,544
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

642
00:58:29,545 --> 00:58:32,381
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

643
00:58:32,382 --> 00:58:37,302
So say you really needed the toilet...

644
00:58:37,303 --> 00:58:42,303
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

645
00:58:42,308 --> 00:58:47,308
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

646
00:58:58,241 --> 00:59:03,241
<i>Expe/liarmus.</i>

647
00:59:04,872 --> 00:59:06,415
I'm hopeless.

648
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:11,416
You're just flourishing your wand
too much. Try it like this. Expe/liarmus.

649
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:17,759
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

650
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,138
to ensure maximum retention.

651
00:59:21,139 --> 00:59:25,017
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

652
00:59:25,018 --> 00:59:30,018
- Expe/liarmus.
- Wands away.

653
00:59:39,991 --> 00:59:43,243
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

654
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:45,620
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

655
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:50,621
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

656
00:59:55,715 --> 00:59:56,259
<i>Stupefy!</i>

657
01:00:02,013 --> 01:00:07,013
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

658
01:00:11,814 --> 01:00:14,316
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

659
01:00:14,317 --> 01:00:18,987
Thanks, Ronald.

660
01:00:18,988 --> 01:00:21,323
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

661
01:00:21,324 --> 01:00:24,743
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

662
01:00:24,744 --> 01:00:29,744
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

663
01:00:33,836 --> 01:00:34,380
<i>Stupefy-</i>

664
01:00:40,843 --> 01:00:43,220
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

665
01:00:43,221 --> 01:00:48,221
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

666
01:00:50,061 --> 01:00:55,061
It was completely intentional.

667
01:01:18,214 --> 01:01:23,214
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

668
01:01:23,469 --> 01:01:28,014
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

669
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:31,560
<i>Expe/liarmus.</i>

670
01:01:31,561 --> 01:01:36,231
Very good. Keep your concentration.

671
01:01:36,232 --> 01:01:38,984
Great.

672
01:01:38,985 --> 01:01:43,985
A little higher.

673
01:01:49,078 --> 01:01:54,078
I'm okay. I'm okay.

674

<i>Diminuendo.</i>

678
01:02:28,242 --> 01:02:32,704
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

679
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:35,081
Believing in yourself.

680
01:02:35,082 --> 01:02:37,375
<i>- Expe/liarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.</i>

681
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:39,127
Think of it this way.

682
01:02:39,128 --> 01:02:43,465
Every great Wizard in history
has started out...

683
01:02:43,466 --> 01:02:47,510
as nothing more
than what we are now: Students.

684
01:02:47,511 --> 01:02:52,511
If they can do it, why not us?

685
01:03:00,608 --> 01:03:04,569
<i>- Stupefy.

691
01:03:39,939 --> 01:03:44,939
<i>Expe/liarmus.</i>

692
01:03:45,861 --> 01:03:50,861
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

693
01:03:50,866 --> 01:03:53,201
So that's it for this lesson.

694
01:03:53,202 --> 01:03:56,997
Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

695
01:03:56,998 --> 01:04:00,208
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

696
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:05,209
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

697
01:04:08,384 --> 01:04:09,968
Well done, mate.

698
01:04:09,969 --> 01:04:10,469
Thanks.

699
01:04:17,059 --> 01:04:22,059
See you after Christmas.

700
01:04:28,904 --> 01:04:32,365
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

701
01:04:32,366 --> 01:04:35,744
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

702
01:04:35,745 --> 01:04:36,911
Merry Christmas.

703
01:04:36,912 --> 01:04:39,664
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

704
01:04:39,665 --> 01:04:42,208
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

705
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:44,252
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

706
01:04:44,253 --> 01:04:47,005
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

707
01:04:47,006 --> 01:04:49,591
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

708
01:04:49,592 --> 01:04:52,427
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

709
01:04:52,428 --> 01:04:57,428
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

710
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,779
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

711
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,865
Yeah. I'm okay.

712
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:18,866
Anyway, it's worth it.

713
01:05:21,999 --> 01:05:25,960
It's just, learning all this...

714
01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:29,589
makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...

715
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:32,884
Cedric did know this stuff.

716
01:05:32,885 --> 01:05:35,929
He was really good.

717
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:40,930
It's just, Voldemort was better.

718
01:05:43,187 --> 01:05:46,272
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

719
01:05:46,273 --> 01:05:51,273
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

720
01:05:58,327 --> 01:06:03,327
Mistletoe.

721
01:06:03,499 --> 01:06:06,501
Probably full of Nargles, though.

722
01:06:06,502 --> 01:06:08,878
What are Nargles?

723
01:06:08,879 --> 01:06:09,379
Noidea.

724
01:06:32,653 --> 01:06:35,613
<i>Well, how was it?</i>

725
01:06:35,614 --> 01:06:37,782
Wet.

726
01:06:37,783 --> 01:06:39,909
I mean, she was sort of Crying.

727
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:42,036
That bad at it, are you?

728
01:06:42,037 --> 01:06:47,037
I'm sure Ham/s kissing
was more than satisfactory.

729
01:06:47,626 --> 01:06:49,961
Cho spends half her time
Crying these days.

730
01:06:49,962 --> 01:06:53,715
You'd think a bit of snogging
would Cheer her up.

731
01:06:53,716 --> 01:06:58,716
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

732
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:04,601
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

733
01:07:04,602 --> 01:07:07,854
and Confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

734
01:07:07,855 --> 01:07:11,232
conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

735
01:07:11,233 --> 01:07:16,233
and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

736
01:07:16,906 --> 01:07:20,658
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

737
01:07:20,659 --> 01:07:25,659
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...

738
01:07:40,387 --> 01:07:40,887
<i>Harry.</i>

739
01:07:50,147 --> 01:07:53,900
<i>Voldemort may be after something.</i>

740
01:07:53,901 --> 01:07:57,737
<i>Something he didn't have last time.</i>

741
01:07:57,738 --> 01:08:00,615
<i>Harry.</i>

742
01:08:00,616 --> 01:08:01,116
<i>Harry.</i>

743
01:08:32,982 --> 01:08:36,568
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

744
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:38,528
or looking down at the scene?

745
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:42,031
Neither. It was like I...

746
01:08:42,032 --> 01:08:44,325
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

747
01:08:44,326 --> 01:08:46,828
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty
tonight.

748
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:49,414
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

749
01:08:49,415 --> 01:08:51,165
- Sir.
- Phineas.

750
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:53,626
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

751
01:08:53,627 --> 01:08:56,421
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

752
01:08:56,422 --> 01:09:00,758
and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

753
01:09:00,759 --> 01:09:04,012
They've got him, Albus. It was close,
but they think he'll make it.

754
01:09:04,013 --> 01:09:06,681
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

755
01:09:06,682 --> 01:09:08,766
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

756
01:09:08,767 --> 01:09:13,767
Look at me!

757
01:09:16,483 --> 01:09:21,483
What's happening to me?

758
01:09:26,577 --> 01:09:28,620
You wished to see me, headmaster?

759
01:09:28,621 --> 01:09:33,621
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

760
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:38,917
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

761
01:09:41,592 --> 01:09:43,384
It appears there's a connection...

762
01:09:43,385 --> 01:09:45,887
between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

763
01:09:45,888 --> 01:09:50,391
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

764
01:09:50,392 --> 01:09:53,603
Pray he remains ignorant.

765
01:09:53,604 --> 01:09:57,357
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

766
01:09:57,358 --> 01:10:01,903
- ...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

767
01:10:01,904 --> 01:10:03,946
unhinge it.

768
01:10:03,947 --> 01:10:07,492
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

769
01:10:07,493 --> 01:10:09,911
to invade the minds of his victims...

770
01:10:09,912 --> 01:10:14,624
creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

771
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:19,587
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

772
01:10:19,588 --> 01:10:24,050
only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

773
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:26,260
kill them.

774
01:10:26,261 --> 01:10:28,846
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

775
01:10:28,847 --> 01:10:32,517
will help shield you
from access or influence.

776
01:10:32,518 --> 01:10:37,518
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

777
01:10:37,856 --> 01:10:41,234
You will attempt to resist.

778
01:10:41,235 --> 01:10:45,446
Prepare yourself.

779
01:10:45,447 --> 01:10:50,447
<i>Legilimens.</i>

780
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:59,790
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

781
01:11:24,278 --> 01:11:27,113
<i>Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.</i>

782
01:11:27,114 --> 01:11:29,949
Here we go.

783
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:34,950
Daddy's back.

784
01:11:35,289 --> 01:11:39,083
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

785
01:11:39,084 --> 01:11:44,084
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

786
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:48,634
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

787
01:11:48,635 --> 01:11:51,095
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

788
01:11:51,096 --> 01:11:53,681
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

789
01:11:53,682 --> 01:11:58,144
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

790
01:11:58,145 --> 01:12:01,189
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

791
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,357
Oh, Harry, Harry.

792
01:12:03,358 --> 01:12:06,277
There you are.

793
01:12:06,278 --> 01:12:08,696
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

794
01:12:08,697 --> 01:12:10,698
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

795
01:12:10,699 --> 01:12:12,867
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

796
01:12:12,868 --> 01:12:14,744
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

797
01:12:14,745 --> 01:12:16,287
Fred? George?

798
01:12:16,288 --> 01:12:18,998
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

799
01:12:18,999 --> 01:12:21,876
To Mr. Harry Potter...

800
01:12:21,877 --> 01:12:26,877
without whom I would not be here.

801
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,802
,Harry-, Harry-

802
01:12:30,803 --> 01:12:33,054
Harry.

803
01:12:33,055 --> 01:12:35,807
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

804
01:12:35,808 --> 01:12:39,101
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

805
01:12:39,102 --> 01:12:43,314
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

806
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:45,316
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

807
01:12:45,317 --> 01:12:47,360
No more than usual, Ron.

808
01:12:47,361 --> 01:12:52,361
I don't know why...

809
01:12:55,202 --> 01:12:59,956
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.

810
01:12:59,957 --> 01:13:04,877
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

811
01:13:04,878 --> 01:13:08,297
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

812
01:13:08,298 --> 01:13:11,092
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

813
01:13:11,093 --> 01:13:14,095
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

814
01:13:14,096 --> 01:13:16,264
Of course, master.

815
01:13:16,265 --> 01:13:21,265
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

816
01:13:23,272 --> 01:13:25,731
Sorry about that.

817
01:13:25,732 --> 01:13:29,735
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

818
01:13:29,736 --> 01:13:32,655
Not to me, anyway.

819
01:13:32,656 --> 01:13:34,782
What, you grew up here?

820
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:37,368
This is my parents' house.

821
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:42,331
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

822
01:13:42,332 --> 01:13:47,003
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

823
01:13:47,004 --> 01:13:50,298
This is the Black family tree.

824
01:13:50,299 --> 01:13:52,592
My deranged cousin.

825
01:13:52,593 --> 01:13:55,469
I hated the lot of them.

826
01:13:55,470 --> 01:14:00,470
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

827
01:14:03,395 --> 01:14:08,395
My mother did that after I ran away.

828
01:14:09,526 --> 01:14:12,653
Charming woman.

829
01:14:12,654 --> 01:14:15,156
I was 16.

830
01:14:15,157 --> 01:14:18,659
Where did you go?

831
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:21,412
Round your dad's.

832
01:14:21,413 --> 01:14:24,832
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

833
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:28,210
I see him so much in you, Harry.

834
01:14:28,211 --> 01:14:31,339
You are so very much alike.

835
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:34,383
I'm not so sure.

836
01:14:34,384 --> 01:14:38,679
Sirius, when I was...

837
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:43,680
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

838
01:14:44,353 --> 01:14:46,687
I was the Snake.

839
01:14:46,688 --> 01:14:49,815
And afterwards,
in Dumbledore's office...

840
01:14:49,816 --> 01:14:54,816
there was a moment
when I wanted to...

841
01:14:59,159 --> 01:15:02,703
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

842
01:15:02,704 --> 01:15:07,625
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

843
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:12,626
I just feel so angry all the time.

844
01:15:12,714 --> 01:15:17,426
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

845
01:15:17,427 --> 01:15:22,427
something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

846
01:15:23,642 --> 01:15:28,062
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

847
01:15:28,063 --> 01:15:31,899
You're not a bad person.

848
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:36,862
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

849
01:15:36,863 --> 01:15:40,074
You understand?

850
01:15:40,075 --> 01:15:45,075
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

851
01:15:45,288 --> 01:15:50,288
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

852
01:15:50,502 --> 01:15:55,502
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

853
01:15:55,716 --> 01:16:00,716
That's who we really are.

854
01:16:01,763 --> 01:16:05,266
Harry, time to go.

855
01:16:05,267 --> 01:16:09,729
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

856
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:12,440
You'll see.

857
01:16:12,441 --> 01:16:12,985
Come on.

858
01:16:51,271 --> 01:16:52,605
Really?

859
01:16:52,606 --> 01:16:55,399
Harry. Harry.

860
01:16:55,400 --> 01:17:00,279
Hagrid's back.

861
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:05,280
I'm sorry.

862
01:17:16,338 --> 01:17:19,799
I will say this one last time.

863
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,343
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

864
01:17:22,344 --> 01:17:25,679
I told you. I've been away
for me health.

865
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:30,017
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

866
01:17:30,018 --> 01:17:35,018
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

867
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,568
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

868
01:17:39,569 --> 01:17:44,569
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

869
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:05,803
This is top-secret, right?

870
01:18:05,804 --> 01:18:08,347
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

871
01:18:08,348 --> 01:18:11,058
Giants?

872
01:18:11,059 --> 01:18:12,268
You found them?

873
01:18:12,269 --> 01:18:17,022
Well, they're not that hard to find, to be
perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

874
01:18:17,023 --> 01:18:20,234
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

875
01:18:20,235 --> 01:18:23,612
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

876
01:18:23,613 --> 01:18:25,990
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

877
01:18:25,991 --> 01:18:29,827
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

878
01:18:29,828 --> 01:18:32,371
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

879
01:18:32,372 --> 01:18:37,372
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I Suppose.

880
01:18:40,088 --> 01:18:42,089
And they did this to you?

881
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:44,341
Not exactly, no.

882
01:18:44,342 --> 01:18:49,342
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

883
01:19:02,235 --> 01:19:04,778
It's changing out there.

884
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:07,823
Just like last time.

885
01:19:07,824 --> 01:19:10,201
There's a storm coming, Harry.

886
01:19:10,202 --> 01:19:15,202
We'd all best be ready when she does.

887
01:19:50,283 --> 01:19:53,494
<i>We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...</i>

888
01:19:53,495 --> 01:19:56,497
in <i>the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.</i>

889
01:19:56,498 --> 01:20:00,334
<i>And of course, the Mugg/e prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.</i>

890
01:20:00,335 --> 01:20:03,254
<i>We strongly suspect...</i>

891
01:20:03,255 --> 01:20:05,422
that the breakout was engineered...

892
01:20:05,423 --> 01:20:09,802
by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

893
01:20:09,803 --> 01:20:14,803
notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

894
01:20:15,475 --> 01:20:20,475
<i>cousin of escapee
Bellatrix Lestrange.</i>

895
01:20:30,156 --> 01:20:32,616
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

896
01:20:32,617 --> 01:20:35,953
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

897
01:20:35,954 --> 01:20:36,454
Harry.

898
01:20:40,792 --> 01:20:43,377
I wanted to apologize.

899
01:20:43,378 --> 01:20:47,715
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

900
01:20:47,716 --> 01:20:52,716
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

901
01:21:00,562 --> 01:21:01,062
Nevme?

902
01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:17,077
Fourteen years ago...

903
01:21:17,078 --> 01:21:21,498
a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

904
01:21:21,499 --> 01:21:25,252
used a Cruciatus Curse
on my parents.

905
01:21:25,253 --> 01:21:29,423
She tortured them for information...

906
01:21:29,424 --> 01:21:33,260
but they never gave in.

907
01:21:33,261 --> 01:21:36,722
I'm quite proud to be their son.

908
01:21:36,723 --> 01:21:41,723
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

909
01:21:46,524 --> 01:21:51,524
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

910
01:21:54,908 --> 01:21:58,786
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

911
01:21:58,787 --> 01:22:02,373
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

912
01:22:02,374 --> 01:22:05,125
George, your turn now.

913
01:22:05,126 --> 01:22:08,379
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

914
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,965
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

915
01:22:11,966 --> 01:22:15,969
but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

916
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:17,930
Wow, that was really good.

917
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:19,640
Fantastic, Ginny.

918
01:22:19,641 --> 01:22:23,852
Just remember, your Patronus can only protect
you for as long as you stay focused.

919
01:22:23,853 --> 01:22:28,853
So focus, Luna.

920
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:31,735
Think of the happiest thing you can.

921
01:22:31,736 --> 01:22:33,862
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

922
01:22:33,863 --> 01:22:36,907
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

923
01:22:36,908 --> 01:22:41,908
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

924
01:22:41,913 --> 01:22:46,913
<i>Expecto Patronum.</i>

925
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:30,043
I'll make short work of this.

926
01:23:30,044 --> 01:23:35,044
<i>Bombarda Maxima.</i>

927
01:23:50,315 --> 01:23:52,107
Get them.

928
01:23:52,108 --> 01:23:53,734
Been watching them for weeks.

929
01:23:53,735 --> 01:23:56,111
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...

930
01:23:56,112 --> 01:24:01,112
proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

931
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:03,410
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

932
01:24:03,411 --> 01:24:05,120
never fooled us for a minute.

933
01:24:05,121 --> 01:24:07,372
We saw your lies for what they were:

934
01:24:07,373 --> 01:24:11,335
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

935
01:24:11,336 --> 01:24:12,544
Naturally.

936
01:24:12,545 --> 01:24:15,255
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

937
01:24:15,256 --> 01:24:19,092
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

938
01:24:19,093 --> 01:24:24,093
the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

939
01:24:24,098 --> 01:24:26,892
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

940
01:24:26,893 --> 01:24:30,521
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

941
01:24:30,522 --> 01:24:32,523
Dispatch an owl to the <i>Daily</i> Prophet.

942
01:24:32,524 --> 01:24:35,234
If we hurry, we should still make
the morning edition.

943
01:24:35,235 --> 01:24:40,197
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

944
01:24:40,198 --> 01:24:42,866
to Azkaban...

945
01:24:42,867 --> 01:24:47,867
to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

946
01:24:48,206 --> 01:24:52,292
I thought we might hit this little snag.

947
01:24:52,293 --> 01:24:56,296
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to...

948
01:24:56,297 --> 01:24:57,923
What was the phrase?

949
01:24:57,924 --> 01:24:59,675
Come quietly.

950
01:24:59,676 --> 01:25:01,802
Well, I can tell you this:

951
01:25:01,803 --> 01:25:04,304
I have no intention
of going to Azkaban.

952
01:25:04,305 --> 01:25:06,056
Enough of this.

953
01:25:06,057 --> 01:25:06,669
Take him.

954
01:25:19,988 --> 01:25:24,533
Well, you may not like him, minister...

955
01:25:24,534 --> 01:25:27,202
but you can't deny...

956
01:25:27,203 --> 01:25:32,203
Dumbledore has got style.

957
01:25:54,147 --> 01:25:58,859
<i>Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.</i>

958
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:02,446
<i>Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...</i>

959
01:26:02,447 --> 01:26:07,447
<i>Students will be submitted to question/bg
about suspected illicit activities.</i>

960
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:12,660
<i>Any student in noncompliance
will be expel/ed.</i>

961
01:27:23,152 --> 01:27:23,652
Harry.

962
01:27:31,703 --> 01:27:35,288
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

963
01:27:35,289 --> 01:27:38,542
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

964
01:27:38,543 --> 01:27:40,877
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

965
01:27:40,878 --> 01:27:43,130
Yeah, we talked you into it.

966
01:27:43,131 --> 01:27:45,674
Yeah, but I agreed.

967
01:27:45,675 --> 01:27:50,675
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things Worse.

968
01:27:51,848 --> 01:27:55,350
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

969
01:27:55,351 --> 01:27:59,730
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

970
01:27:59,731 --> 01:28:02,566
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

971
01:28:02,567 --> 01:28:07,567
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

972
01:28:07,989 --> 01:28:12,989
To go it alone.

973
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:16,747
Hagñd.

974
01:28:21,669 --> 01:28:24,254
Any idea where he's taking us?

975
01:28:24,255 --> 01:28:29,255
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

976
01:28:35,641 --> 01:28:38,477
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

977
01:28:38,478 --> 01:28:41,980
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

978
01:28:41,981 --> 01:28:44,483
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

979
01:28:44,484 --> 01:28:46,860
they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

980
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:48,695
Hagrid, what's going on?

981
01:28:48,696 --> 01:28:51,072
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

982
01:28:51,073 --> 01:28:56,073
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

983
01:28:56,704 --> 01:29:00,040
I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.

984
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:05,041
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

985
01:29:07,715 --> 01:29:08,215
GraWPY-

986
01:29:11,761 --> 01:29:16,761
Down here, you great buffoon.

987
01:29:20,228 --> 01:29:22,687
GraWPY-

988
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:27,688
Brought you some company.

989
01:29:36,744 --> 01:29:39,162
I couldn't just leave him, because...

990
01:29:39,163 --> 01:29:41,081
Because he's my brother.

991
01:29:41,082 --> 01:29:42,374
Blimey.

992
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:44,584
Well, half brother, really.

993
01:29:44,585 --> 01:29:49,585
He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.

994
01:29:51,968 --> 01:29:54,469
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

995
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:57,055
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

996
01:29:57,056 --> 01:29:59,474
That's your new friend, Hermione.

997
01:29:59,475 --> 01:29:59,975
GraWPY-

998
01:30:05,106 --> 01:30:08,316
Grawp.

999
01:30:08,317 --> 01:30:13,317
Put me down.

1000
01:30:15,074 --> 01:30:15,574
Now.

1001
01:30:28,796 --> 01:30:31,172
You all right?

1002
01:30:31,173 --> 01:30:33,258
Fine.

1003
01:30:33,259 --> 01:30:35,719
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1004
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:40,640
I think you've got an admirer.

1005
01:30:40,641 --> 01:30:45,641
You just stay away from her, all right?

1006
01:31:12,924 --> 01:31:16,927
He gets his own food and all.

1007
01:31:16,928 --> 01:31:21,348
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1008
01:31:21,349 --> 01:31:24,059
You will look after him, won't you?

1009
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:29,060
I'm the only family he's got.

1010
01:31:40,368 --> 01:31:45,368
Feeling sentimental?

1011
01:31:45,498 --> 01:31:49,626
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1012
01:31:49,627 --> 01:31:54,627
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1013
01:31:55,549 --> 01:31:58,885
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1014
01:31:58,886 --> 01:32:03,886
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1015
01:32:04,225 --> 01:32:06,643
You're just like your father.

1016
01:32:06,644 --> 01:32:08,603
Lazy, arrogant.

1017
01:32:08,604 --> 01:32:11,022
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1018
01:32:11,023 --> 01:32:13,817
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1019
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:15,902
Control your emotions.

1020
01:32:15,903 --> 01:32:20,903
Discipline your mind.

1021
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:26,701
<i>Legilimens.</i>

1022
01:32:30,084 --> 01:32:31,376
<i>Harry.</i>

1023
01:32:31,377 --> 01:32:33,753
Sirius.

1024
01:32:33,754 --> 01:32:35,422
<i>I may vomit.</i>

1025
01:32:35,423 --> 01:32:37,590
Stop it.

1026
01:32:37,591 --> 01:32:40,385
Is this what you call control?

1027
01:32:40,386 --> 01:32:43,596
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1028
01:32:43,597 --> 01:32:48,597
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1029
01:32:48,644 --> 01:32:50,729
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1030
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:54,858
Sentimental children forever whining
about how unfair your lives have been.

1031
01:32:54,859 --> 01:32:58,403
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.

1032
01:32:58,404 --> 01:33:02,532
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1033
01:33:02,533 --> 01:33:06,619
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1034
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:11,620
<i>- Legi/imens.
- Protega.</i>

1035
01:33:13,669 --> 01:33:15,378
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1036
01:33:15,379 --> 01:33:17,630
<i>Snape. Expelliarmus.</i>

1037
01:33:17,631 --> 01:33:19,799
Nice one, James.

1038
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,302
<i>- Dad.
- Impedimenta.</i>

1039
01:33:22,303 --> 01:33:24,471
<i>Snivel/us Greasy.
Snivel/us Greasy.</i>

1040
01:33:24,472 --> 01:33:27,307
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1041
01:33:27,308 --> 01:33:29,726
<i>Snivel/us Greasy.
Snivel/us Greasy.</i>

1042
01:33:29,727 --> 01:33:32,896
<i>Enough.</i>

1043
01:33:32,897 --> 01:33:33,397
Enough.

1044
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:45,784
Your lessons are at an end.

1045
01:33:47,078 --> 01:33:47,622
Get out.

1046
01:34:07,556 --> 01:34:09,891
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1047
01:34:09,892 --> 01:34:11,976
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1048
01:34:11,977 --> 01:34:15,188
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1049
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:17,357
It's fading already.

1050
01:34:17,358 --> 01:34:22,358
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1051
01:34:29,495 --> 01:34:32,372
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1052
01:34:32,373 --> 01:34:37,373
naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1053
01:34:39,213 --> 01:34:40,713
You know, George...

1054
01:34:40,714 --> 01:34:44,551
I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1055
01:34:44,552 --> 01:34:49,552
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1056
01:36:01,086 --> 01:36:06,086
All right, professor!

1057
01:36:11,513 --> 01:36:16,513
Here you go.

1058
01:36:38,249 --> 01:36:43,249
Ready when you are.

1059
01:38:05,836 --> 01:38:09,255
I need that prophecy.

1060
01:38:09,256 --> 01:38:11,924
You'll have to kill me.

1061
01:38:11,925 --> 01:38:16,679
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1062
01:38:16,680 --> 01:38:17,180
<i>Crucio.</i>

1063
01:38:20,934 --> 01:38:21,434
<i>Crucio.</i>

1064
01:38:34,073 --> 01:38:35,698
Sirius.

1065
01:38:35,699 --> 01:38:36,908
Harry, are you sure?

1066
01:38:36,909 --> 01:38:39,494
I saw it. It's just like
with Mr. Weasley.

1067
01:38:39,495 --> 01:38:41,537
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1068
01:38:41,538 --> 01:38:43,790
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.

1069
01:38:43,791 --> 01:38:45,875
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1070
01:38:45,876 --> 01:38:49,337
Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.

1071
01:38:49,338 --> 01:38:52,799
Harry, please, just listen.

1072
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,094
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1073
01:38:56,095 --> 01:38:59,389
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1074
01:38:59,390 --> 01:39:03,059
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1075
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:08,060
Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.

1076
01:39:09,108 --> 01:39:11,567
What do we do?

1077
01:39:11,568 --> 01:39:13,361
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1078
01:39:13,362 --> 01:39:15,613
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1079
01:39:15,614 --> 01:39:19,992
Not all of them.

1080
01:39:19,993 --> 01:39:24,993
<i>Alohomora.</i>

1081
01:39:32,548 --> 01:39:34,424
Alert the Order if you can.

1082
01:39:34,425 --> 01:39:38,177
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1083
01:39:38,178 --> 01:39:41,973
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1084
01:39:41,974 --> 01:39:45,351
That you are.

1085
01:39:45,352 --> 01:39:50,352
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1086
01:39:53,235 --> 01:39:55,528
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?

1087
01:39:55,529 --> 01:39:57,697
- No.
- Liar.

1088
01:39:57,698 --> 01:40:00,700
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1089
01:40:00,701 --> 01:40:04,620
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1090
01:40:04,621 --> 01:40:06,330
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1091
01:40:06,331 --> 01:40:09,375
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1092
01:40:09,376 --> 01:40:14,376
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1093
01:40:16,550 --> 01:40:18,217
Unless you wish to poison him...

1094
01:40:18,218 --> 01:40:23,218
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1095
01:40:23,265 --> 01:40:27,643
I cannot help you.

1096
01:40:27,644 --> 01:40:30,396
He's got Padfoot.

1097
01:40:30,397 --> 01:40:34,358
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1098
01:40:34,359 --> 01:40:36,652
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1099
01:40:36,653 --> 01:40:41,653
What is he talking about, Snape?

1100
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:45,370
Noidea.

1101
01:40:51,376 --> 01:40:53,920
Very well.

1102
01:40:53,921 --> 01:40:56,631
You give me no choice, Potter.

1103
01:40:56,632 --> 01:40:59,759
As this is an issue
of Ministry security...

1104
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:02,595
you leave me with...

1105
01:41:02,596 --> 01:41:05,348
no alternative.

1106
01:41:05,349 --> 01:41:07,725
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1107
01:41:07,726 --> 01:41:08,935
That's illegal.

1108
01:41:08,936 --> 01:41:13,936
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1109
01:41:19,780 --> 01:41:22,782
Tell her, Harry!

1110
01:41:22,783 --> 01:41:25,451
Tell me what?

1111
01:41:25,452 --> 01:41:28,120
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1112
01:41:28,121 --> 01:41:31,499
I Will.

1113
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:34,502
Where what is?

1114
01:41:34,503 --> 01:41:39,503
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1115
01:41:41,802 --> 01:41:43,511
How much further?

1116
01:41:43,512 --> 01:41:47,181
Not far.

1117
01:41:47,182 --> 01:41:52,182
It had to be Somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1118
01:41:55,232 --> 01:41:56,857
What are you doing?

1119
01:41:56,858 --> 01:42:01,858
Improvising.

1120
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:10,079
Well?

1121
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:15,080
Where is this weapon?

1122
01:42:17,129 --> 01:42:22,129
There isn't one, is there?

1123
01:42:22,175 --> 01:42:27,175
You were trying to trick me.

1124
01:42:28,515 --> 01:42:31,517
You know...

1125
01:42:31,518 --> 01:42:36,518
I really hate children.

1126
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:54,119
You have no business here, Centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1127
01:42:56,209 --> 01:42:58,044
Lower your Weapons.

1128
01:42:58,045 --> 01:43:03,045
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...

1129
01:43:03,759 --> 01:43:05,259
<i>Protego.</i>

1130
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:07,053
How dare you?

1131
01:43:07,054 --> 01:43:09,305
Filthy half-breed.

1132
01:43:09,306 --> 01:43:14,306
<i>Incarcerous.</i>

1133
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:26,322
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1134
01:43:26,323 --> 01:43:31,323
Now, enough. I will have order.

1135
01:43:39,836 --> 01:43:42,588
You filthy animal.

1136
01:43:42,589 --> 01:43:45,716
Do you know who I am?

1137
01:43:45,717 --> 01:43:48,719
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1138
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:53,720
No, he doesn't understand.

1139
01:43:58,271 --> 01:44:01,899
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1140
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,984
I'm sorry, professor.

1141
01:44:03,985 --> 01:44:05,945
But I must not tell lies.

1142
01:44:05,946 --> 01:44:07,154
What are you doing?

1143
01:44:07,155 --> 01:44:11,450
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1144
01:44:11,451 --> 01:44:16,288
Let me go!

1145
01:44:16,289 --> 01:44:18,290
Thank you, Grawp.

1146
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:23,291
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1147
01:44:30,053 --> 01:44:33,806
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1148
01:44:33,807 --> 01:44:36,100
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1149
01:44:36,101 --> 01:44:39,478
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1150
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:41,814
That was clever, Ron.

1151
01:44:41,815 --> 01:44:44,483
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1152
01:44:44,484 --> 01:44:47,653
So how are we getting to London?

1153
01:44:47,654 --> 01:44:52,032
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1154
01:44:52,033 --> 01:44:54,910
but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1155
01:44:54,911 --> 01:44:58,205
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1156
01:44:58,206 --> 01:45:02,209
Or was that all just words to you?

1157
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:07,210
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1158
01:45:10,343 --> 01:45:13,888
So how are we going to get to London?

1159
01:45:13,889 --> 01:45:18,889
We fly, of course.

1160
01:46:07,192 --> 01:46:12,192
<i>Department of Mysteries.</i>

1161
01:46:18,203 --> 01:46:23,203
This is it.

1162
01:47:12,883 --> 01:47:16,927
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1163
01:47:16,928 --> 01:47:19,555
Ninety-four.

1164
01:47:19,556 --> 01:47:24,556
Ninety-five.

1165
01:47:33,153 --> 01:47:38,153
- He should be here.
- Harm.

1166
01:47:38,617 --> 01:47:43,617
It's got your name on it.

1167
01:48:05,101 --> 01:48:10,101
<i>The one with the power
to Vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.</i>

1168
01:48:10,315 --> 01:48:12,900
<i>And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...</i>

1169
01:48:12,901 --> 01:48:17,901
<i>but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.</i>

1170
01:48:21,368 --> 01:48:26,368
<i>For neither can live
while the other survives.</i>

1171
01:48:29,209 --> 01:48:29,709
Harry.

1172
01:48:40,804 --> 01:48:42,471
Where's Sirius?

1173
01:48:42,472 --> 01:48:47,472
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1174
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:53,899
and reality.

1175
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:58,900
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1176
01:48:59,572 --> 01:49:01,240
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1177
01:49:01,241 --> 01:49:06,078
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1178
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:08,831
He knows how to play.

1179
01:49:08,832 --> 01:49:12,793
Itty, bitty baby.

1180
01:49:12,794 --> 01:49:14,586
Potter.

1181
01:49:14,587 --> 01:49:16,630
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1182
01:49:16,631 --> 01:49:19,758
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1183
01:49:19,759 --> 01:49:24,430
Better, now they're
about to be avenged.

1184
01:49:24,431 --> 01:49:29,431
Now, let's everybody
just calm down...

1185
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,395
shall we?

1186
01:49:31,396 --> 01:49:34,023
All we want is that prophecy.

1187
01:49:34,024 --> 01:49:36,400
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1188
01:49:36,401 --> 01:49:39,570
You dare speak his name?

1189
01:49:39,571 --> 01:49:41,321
You filthy half-blood!

1190
01:49:41,322 --> 01:49:45,868
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1191
01:49:45,869 --> 01:49:50,869
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1192
01:49:51,499 --> 01:49:56,499
Which is lucky for you, really.

1193
01:49:58,006 --> 01:50:00,466
Haven't you always wondered...

1194
01:50:00,467 --> 01:50:05,467
the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1195
01:50:06,389 --> 01:50:09,058
Why he was unable to kill you...

1196
01:50:09,059 --> 01:50:12,978
when you were just an infant?

1197
01:50:12,979 --> 01:50:17,979
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1198
01:50:18,693 --> 01:50:23,693
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1199
01:50:24,324 --> 01:50:26,867
All you have to do...

1200
01:50:26,868 --> 01:50:29,119
is give it to me.

1201
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:34,120
Then I can show you everything.

1202
01:50:41,174 --> 01:50:43,550
I've waited 14 years.

1203
01:50:43,551 --> 01:50:46,178
I know.

1204
01:50:46,179 --> 01:50:49,264
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.

1205
01:50:49,265 --> 01:50:49,809
<i>Stupefy-</i>

1206
01:51:06,825 --> 01:51:11,825
<i>Le vicorpus.</i>

1207
01:51:14,374 --> 01:51:16,583
<i>Petrificus Tota/us.</i>

1208
01:51:16,584 --> 01:51:21,584
Well done, Neville.

1209
01:51:26,845 --> 01:51:30,139
<i>Stupefy-</i>

1210
01:51:30,140 --> 01:51:35,140
<i>_5tupefy. _5tupefy.</i>

1211
01:51:42,527 --> 01:51:43,071
<i>Stupefy-</i>

1212
01:51:51,953 --> 01:51:52,497
<i>Reducto.</i>

1213
01:52:10,263 --> 01:52:15,263
Get back to the door.

1214
01:52:47,675 --> 01:52:52,675
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1215
01:52:57,393 --> 01:52:59,853
The Voices.

1216
01:52:59,854 --> 01:53:03,565
Can you tell what they're saying?

1217
01:53:03,566 --> 01:53:06,485
There aren't any Voices, Harry.

1218
01:53:06,486 --> 01:53:08,403
Let's get out of here.

1219
01:53:08,404 --> 01:53:13,116
I hear them too.

1220
01:53:13,117 --> 01:53:18,117
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1221
01:53:18,498 --> 01:53:20,666
Please, Harry.

1222
01:53:20,667 --> 01:53:25,667
Get behind me.

1223
01:54:09,090 --> 01:54:11,967
Did you actually believe...

1224
01:54:11,968 --> 01:54:16,968
or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1225
01:54:17,181 --> 01:54:22,181
that children stood a Chance
against us?

1226
01:54:25,815 --> 01:54:30,815
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1227
01:54:33,239 --> 01:54:36,742
Give me the prophecy now...

1228
01:54:36,743 --> 01:54:41,743
or watch your friends die.

1229
01:54:53,676 --> 01:54:58,676
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1230
01:55:21,371 --> 01:55:26,371
Get away from my godson.

1231
01:55:54,237 --> 01:55:57,155
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1232
01:55:57,156 --> 01:55:59,157
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1233
01:55:59,158 --> 01:56:02,661
You've done beautifully.

1234
01:56:02,662 --> 01:56:04,454
Now, let me take it from here.

1235
01:56:04,455 --> 01:56:04,955
Black.

1236
01:56:32,650 --> 01:56:34,151
<i>Expe/liarmus!</i>

1237
01:56:34,152 --> 01:56:39,152
Nice one, James.

1238
01:56:42,702 --> 01:56:47,702
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

1239
01:57:04,390 --> 01:57:04,890
<i>No. No.</i>

1240
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:34,294
I killed Sirius Black.

1241
01:57:34,295 --> 01:57:39,295
- You Coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1242
01:57:48,601 --> 01:57:51,937
<i>You've got to mean it, Harry.</i>

1243
01:57:51,938 --> 01:57:56,938
<i>She killed him. She deserves it.</i>

1244
01:57:59,529 --> 01:58:04,529
<i>You know the spe/I, Harry.</i>

1245
01:58:14,293 --> 01:58:14,793
Do it.

1246
01:58:23,594 --> 01:58:24,138
So weak.

1247
01:58:33,312 --> 01:58:36,690
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1248
01:58:36,691 --> 01:58:38,608
The Aurors are on their way.

1249
01:58:38,609 --> 01:58:43,609
By which time I shall be gone,
and you...

1250
01:58:44,323 --> 01:58:49,323
shall be dead.

1251
02:01:00,751 --> 02:01:05,751
You've lost, old man.

1252
02:01:22,773 --> 02:01:23,273
Harry.

1253
02:01:27,945 --> 02:01:29,946
<i>So weak.</i>

1254
02:01:29,947 --> 02:01:34,947
<i>So vulnerable.</i>

1255
02:01:36,454 --> 02:01:39,998
Look at me.

1256
02:01:39,999 --> 02:01:44,419
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1257
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:49,420
It's how you are not.

1258
02:01:51,844 --> 02:01:52,344
Harry?

1259
02:02:25,753 --> 02:02:27,837
You're the weak one...

1260
02:02:27,838 --> 02:02:32,838
and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1261
02:02:35,387 --> 02:02:40,387
And I feel sorry for you.

1262
02:03:01,330 --> 02:03:05,750
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1263
02:03:05,751 --> 02:03:10,751
And you will lose everything.

1264
02:03:25,813 --> 02:03:30,813
He's back.

1265
02:04:35,215 --> 02:04:37,050
I know how you feel, Harry.

1266
02:04:37,051 --> 02:04:42,051
No, you don't.

1267
02:04:44,308 --> 02:04:45,850
It's my fault.

1268
02:04:45,851 --> 02:04:50,146
No, the fault is mine.

1269
02:04:50,147 --> 02:04:52,065
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1270
02:04:52,066 --> 02:04:55,944
before Voldemort made the connection
between you.

1271
02:04:55,945 --> 02:05:00,365
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...

1272
02:05:00,366 --> 02:05:05,366
he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.

1273
02:05:08,415 --> 02:05:12,377
The prophecy said:

1274
02:05:12,378 --> 02:05:17,378
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."

1275
02:05:17,675 --> 02:05:22,675
it means one of us is gonna
have to kill the other, in the end.

1276
02:05:25,724 --> 02:05:27,767
Yes.

1277
02:05:27,768 --> 02:05:29,519
Why didn't you tell me?

1278
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,272
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1279
02:05:33,273 --> 02:05:36,567
The same reason your friends saved you.

1280
02:05:36,568 --> 02:05:40,238
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1281
02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:44,617
I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1282
02:05:44,618 --> 02:05:49,618
I cared too much about you.

1283
02:06:11,603 --> 02:06:14,105
How come you're not at the feast?

1284
02:06:14,106 --> 02:06:18,818
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

1285
02:06:18,819 --> 02:06:20,028
That's awful.

1286
02:06:20,029 --> 02:06:22,071
Oh, it's all good fun.

1287
02:06:22,072 --> 02:06:25,700
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1288
02:06:25,701 --> 02:06:30,701
Do you want any help finding them?

1289
02:06:30,956 --> 02:06:35,956
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1290
02:06:41,216 --> 02:06:43,468
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1291
02:06:43,469 --> 02:06:45,303
That's all right.

1292
02:06:45,304 --> 02:06:47,638
Anyway, my mum always said...

1293
02:06:47,639 --> 02:06:52,639
the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1294
02:06:54,730 --> 02:06:59,484
If not always in the way we expect.

1295
02:06:59,485 --> 02:07:04,485
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1296
02:07:37,856 --> 02:07:40,942
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1297
02:07:40,943 --> 02:07:43,236
What's that?

1298
02:07:43,237 --> 02:07:46,197
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1299
02:07:46,198 --> 02:07:49,450
we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1300
02:07:49,451 --> 02:07:52,870
Yeah?

1301
02:07:52,871 --> 02:07:57,871
Something worth fighting for.

1302
02:08:08,153 --> 02:08:30,320
