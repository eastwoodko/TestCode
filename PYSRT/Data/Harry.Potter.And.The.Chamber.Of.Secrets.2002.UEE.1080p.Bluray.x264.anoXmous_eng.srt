I can't let you out, Hedwig.

I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

VERNON: Harry Potter!

He's in there. Vernon?

I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

But she's bored.

If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:51,275
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,276 --> 00:01:56,276
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

Who would want to be
friends with you?

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,375
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,376 --> 00:02:12,045
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

Dudley's second bedroom...

of our hearts.

Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.

Which should be any minute.

Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

Excellent.

And you?

26
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:50,208
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

Too right, you will.

With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...

- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

Not to be rude or anything...

34
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,456
but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

37
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:40,421
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

but never has he been asked
to sit down by a Wizard, like an equal.

You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

No, I haven't.

Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby sen/es, sir.

But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

Harry Potter must not go back...

to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

There is a plot, a plot to make

What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

- Raids?

155
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,173
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

156
00:13:22,174 --> 00:13:25,510
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

157
00:13:25,511 --> 00:13:29,639
Well, now.

158
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,641
And who are you?

159
00:13:31,642 --> 00:13:35,645
Oh, sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

160
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:39,023
Good Lord. Are you really?

161
00:13:39,024 --> 00:13:43,528
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

162
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,488
This morning.

163
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:50,489
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

164
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:54,205
Did you really? How did it go?

165
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:59,206
I mean... That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

166
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:04,507
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

167
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:09,508
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

168
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:11,347
Oh, um...

169
00:14:11,348 --> 00:14:13,099
[OWL SCREECH ES]

170
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,100
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

171
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:24,736
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

172
00:14:24,737 --> 00:14:29,615
- Errol.
RON: He's always doing that.

173
00:14:29,616 --> 00:14:33,745
Oh, look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

174
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:36,998
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

175
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,083
MRS. WEASLEY: Oh, no.
- This lot won't come cheap.

176
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:44,084
- The spell books alone are expensive.
MRS. WEASLEY: We'll manage.

177
00:14:44,131 --> 00:14:49,131
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

178
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:51,220
Right.

179
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:53,514
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

180
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:56,601
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

181
00:14:56,602 --> 00:14:57,810
Floo powder?

182
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:02,732
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

183
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:05,151
In you go.

184
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:10,152
That's it.

185
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:15,157
Diagon Alley.

186
00:15:17,915 --> 00:15:22,915
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

187
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,587
Come on.

188
00:15:24,588 --> 00:15:27,924
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

189
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:32,925
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

190
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,556
That's it, very good.

191
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:40,557
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

192
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:46,688
Diagonally.

193
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:53,116
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

194
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:58,117
I thought he did.

195
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:15,698
Don't touch anything, Draco.

196
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,699
Yes, Father.

197
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:35,468
Master Malfoy,
what a pleasure to see you again.

198
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:39,013
And young Master Malfoy too.
Delighted.

199
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:42,225
I must show you, just in today
and very reasonably priced...

200
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:44,936
I'm not buying today, Borgin,
I'm selling.

201
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:49,937
- Semng?
- Draco.

202
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:53,361
You are aware, no doubt,
that the Ministry of Magic...

203
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:56,614
is conducting more raids
on private houses.

204
00:17:56,615 --> 00:17:59,992
There's even rumors of a new
Muggle Protection Act.

205
00:17:59,993 --> 00:18:04,538
Pure wizard blood is counting for less
everywhere, I'm afraid.

206
00:18:04,539 --> 00:18:06,832
Not with me.

207
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:09,752
Anyway, I brought
a few items from home...

208
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:14,753
that might prove, ahem, embarrassing
were the Ministry to call.

209
00:18:14,883 --> 00:18:19,883
Just poisons and the like.

210
00:18:20,722 --> 00:18:23,683
Look at that.

211
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:27,395
That particular item...

212
00:18:27,396 --> 00:18:29,063
is not for sale.

213
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,148
I understand.

214
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:33,317
It has unique qualities.

215
00:18:33,318 --> 00:18:38,318
One wouldn't want to see it
falling into the wrong hands.

216
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:56,590
You can keep the box.

217
00:18:56,591 --> 00:19:00,803
What did I say?

218
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:02,638
Touch nothing.

219
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:07,639
- Exactly.
- Sorry, Father.

220
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:10,146
Come on, we're going.

221
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:13,774
It's a pleasure to do business
with you, Mr. Malfoy.

222
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:18,775
Always a pleasure.

223
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:36,964
Looking for something?

224
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:38,883
No, I...

225
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:41,093
I'm just in the wrong place.

226
00:19:41,094 --> 00:19:43,971
Sorry.

227
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:48,972
Thank you.

228
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:05,155
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...

229
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:11,661
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

230
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:15,544
- No. Please... Hagrid!
HAGRID: Harry?

231
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:20,545
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

232
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:29,137
HAGRID: You're a mess, Harry. Skulking
around Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

233
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:33,771
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

234
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:36,148
I was lost, I...

235
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:39,276
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

236
00:20:39,277 --> 00:20:44,277
Me? I was... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

237
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:49,616
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

238
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,292
Harry. Hagrid.

239
00:20:55,293 --> 00:20:57,128
Hello, Hermione.

240
00:20:57,129 --> 00:21:00,381
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

241
00:21:00,382 --> 00:21:03,134
What did you do to your glasses?

242
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:08,135
<i>Ocu/us Reparo.</i>

243
00:21:09,474 --> 00:21:12,393
I definitely need to remember that one.

244
00:21:12,394 --> 00:21:16,313
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

245
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:18,023
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

246
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:23,024
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

247
00:21:30,662 --> 00:21:31,912
MRS. WEASLEY: Oh, Harry.

248
00:21:31,913 --> 00:21:35,332
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

249
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,335
MAN 1: Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

250
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:43,336
Here he is.

251
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:46,385
Mum fancies him.

252
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:49,847
MAN 2: Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

253
00:21:49,848 --> 00:21:54,848
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the <i>Daily</i> Prophet.

254
00:21:57,439 --> 00:22:01,859
It can't be. Harry Potter?

255
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,903
PHOTOGRAPHER: Harry Potter!

256
00:22:03,904 --> 00:22:07,156
Excuse me, madam.

257
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:11,160
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.

258
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:14,705
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

259
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:18,042
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

260
00:22:18,043 --> 00:22:23,043
to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

261
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:28,719
which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

262
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,720
its 27th week atop
the <i>Daily</i> Prophet bestseller list...

263
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:38,725
he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

264
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:44,397
with my entire Collected works...

265
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:49,240
free of Charge.

266
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:51,742
Now, ladies?

267
00:22:51,743 --> 00:22:54,995
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

268
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:59,996
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

269
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:10,469
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

270
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:15,470
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

271
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,476
Leave him alone.

272
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:21,146
Look, PoüeL
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

273
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:25,609
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

274
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,280
Mr. Potter.

275
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:33,450
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

276
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:36,996
Forgive me.

277
00:23:36,997 --> 00:23:39,623
Your scar is legend.

278
00:23:39,624 --> 00:23:42,167
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

279
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:46,463
Voldemort killed my parents.

280
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:50,968
He was nothing more than a murderer.

281
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:54,513
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

282
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:56,307
Or very foolish.

283
00:23:56,308 --> 00:24:01,308
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

284
00:24:01,396 --> 00:24:06,396
And you must be Miss Granger.

285
00:24:07,527 --> 00:24:12,527
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

286
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:21,494
Muggles, aren't they?

287
00:24:22,876 --> 00:24:27,876
Let me see.
Red hair, Vacant expressions...

288
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:32,926
tatty, Secondhand book.

289
00:24:32,927 --> 00:24:36,722
You must be the Weasleys.

290
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:38,891
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

291
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:42,853
LUCIUS: Well, Weasley senior.
- Lucius.

292
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:47,691
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

293
00:24:47,692 --> 00:24:50,194
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

294
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:55,115
butjudging by the state of this,
I'd say not.

295
00:24:55,116 --> 00:24:59,036
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of Wizard...

296
00:24:59,037 --> 00:25:01,413
if they don't even pay you well for it?

297
00:25:01,414 --> 00:25:06,414
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

298
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:10,547
Clearly.

299
00:25:10,548 --> 00:25:15,548
Associating with Muggles.

300
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:23,473
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

301
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:31,398
I'll see you at work.

302
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:38,363
See you at school.

303
00:25:43,498 --> 00:25:44,915
MR. WEASLEY: 10:58, come on.

304
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:46,375
MRS. WEASLEY:
The train will leave soon.

305
00:25:46,376 --> 00:25:51,376
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

306
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,760
Okay.

307
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:06,812
MR. WEASLEY: After you, dear.

308
00:26:06,813 --> 00:26:11,813
MRS. WEASLEY: Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

309
00:26:11,985 --> 00:26:12,597

itself for some reason.

However, as head of Gryffindor house...

it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

Mandrake, or Mandragora...

is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

397
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:16,792
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's

Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,040
and market my own range
of hair-care potions. Good girl.

466
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:51,214
Now, be warned.

467
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:53,466
It is my job to arm you...

468
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:58,467
against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

469
00:41:59,598 --> 00:42:03,351
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

470
00:42:03,352 --> 00:42:07,563
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

471
00:42:07,564 --> 00:42:10,691
I must ask you not to scream.

472
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:15,692
It might provoke them.

473
00:42:16,698 --> 00:42:18,407
Cornish pixies?

474
00:42:18,408 --> 00:42:22,245
LOCKHART:
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

475
00:42:22,246 --> 00:42:24,539
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

476
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,876
but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

477
00:42:28,877 --> 00:42:33,877
Let's see what you make of them.

478
00:42:36,134 --> 00:42:41,134
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

479
00:42:55,153 --> 00:43:00,153
PIXIE: You just stay there!
NEVILLE: Please, get me down!

480
00:43:01,618 --> 00:43:05,746
HERMIONE: Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

481
00:43:05,747 --> 00:43:10,747
<i>Peskipiksi Pesternomi!</i>

482
00:43:28,937 --> 00:43:33,937
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their Cage.

483
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:38,613
What do we do now?

484
00:43:38,614 --> 00:43:43,614
<i>Immobulusl.</i>

485
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:54,625
Why is it always me?

486
00:43:58,216 --> 00:44:01,135
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

487
00:44:01,136 --> 00:44:04,931
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

488
00:44:04,932 --> 00:44:09,932
What...? I don't believe it.

489
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,898
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

490
00:44:13,899 --> 00:44:18,899
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

491
00:44:19,696 --> 00:44:22,531
Uh-oh. I smell trouble.

492
00:44:22,532 --> 00:44:26,202
"L, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

493
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:29,872
permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

494
00:44:29,873 --> 00:44:34,873
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

495
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:39,298
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

496
00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:42,927
And that's not all
that's new this year.

497
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:46,555
Those are Nimbus 20013.
How did you get those?

498
00:44:46,556 --> 00:44:48,766
A gift from Draco's father.

499
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:52,728
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

500
00:44:52,729 --> 00:44:55,898
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

501
00:44:55,899 --> 00:45:00,899
They got in on pure talent.

502
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:06,989
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

503
00:45:08,412 --> 00:45:13,412
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

504
00:45:19,423 --> 00:45:24,260
You okay, Ron?

505
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:29,261
Say something.

506
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:37,310
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
HARRY: No, Colin, get out of the way.

507
00:45:37,774 --> 00:45:39,942
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

508
00:45:39,943 --> 00:45:44,943
He'll know what to do.

509
00:45:50,954 --> 00:45:55,954
HAGRID: This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

510
00:45:58,128 --> 00:46:02,339
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

511
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,135
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

512
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:11,136
- Who was Ron trying to Curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

513
00:46:12,642 --> 00:46:17,642
Well, I don't know
exactly what it means.

514
00:46:20,025 --> 00:46:22,401
He called me a Mudblood.

515
00:46:22,402 --> 00:46:25,488
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

516
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:30,159
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul
name for someone Who's Muggle-born.

517
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,914
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

518
00:46:34,915 --> 00:46:39,915
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

519
00:46:40,212 --> 00:46:45,174
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

520
00:46:45,175 --> 00:46:50,012
who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

521
00:46:50,013 --> 00:46:54,683
That's horrible.

522
00:46:54,684 --> 00:46:56,185
It's disgusting.

523
00:46:56,186 --> 00:46:59,855
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

524
00:46:59,856 --> 00:47:03,359
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

525
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,072
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

526
00:47:08,073 --> 00:47:11,408
Come here.

527
00:47:11,409 --> 00:47:16,409
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

528
00:47:18,416 --> 00:47:18,916
Aye?

529
00:47:25,632 --> 00:47:28,884
LOCKHART: Harry, Harry, Harry.

530
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:31,262
Can you possibly imagine...

531
00:47:31,263 --> 00:47:35,099
a better way to serve detention...

532
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,977
than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

533
00:47:37,978 --> 00:47:39,562
Not really.

534
00:47:39,563 --> 00:47:44,563
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as Celebrity does.

535
00:47:46,111 --> 00:47:51,111
Remember that.

536
00:47:51,783 --> 00:47:54,118
VOICE: Come.

537
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,496
Come...

538
00:47:57,497 --> 00:47:58,109
to me.

539
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:08,465
- What?
- Sorry?

540
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:10,593
That voice.

541
00:48:10,594 --> 00:48:11,094
Voice?

542
00:48:15,682 --> 00:48:20,682
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

543
00:48:20,937 --> 00:48:24,690
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

544
00:48:24,691 --> 00:48:29,111
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

545
00:48:29,112 --> 00:48:34,112
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

546
00:48:37,454 --> 00:48:37,954
Spooky.

547
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:45,294
<i>VOICE: Blood.</i>

548
00:48:45,295 --> 00:48:49,006
<i>I smell blood.</i>

549
00:48:49,007 --> 00:48:52,301
<i>Let me rip you.</i>

550
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:57,302
<i>Let me kill you.</i>

551
00:48:57,682 --> 00:49:00,059
<i>Kill!</i>

552
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:02,144
<i>Kill!</i>

553
00:49:02,145 --> 00:49:04,188
<i>- Ki/I!
- Harwl.</i>

554
00:49:04,189 --> 00:49:06,857
HARRY: Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

555
00:49:06,858 --> 00:49:10,486
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

556
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:14,698
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just...

557
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:16,992
<i>It's time.</i>

558
00:49:16,993 --> 00:49:21,163
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

559
00:49:21,164 --> 00:49:26,164
RON: Kill?
HERMIONE: Harry, wait! Not so fast!

560
00:49:50,694 --> 00:49:53,237
Strange.

561
00:49:53,238 --> 00:49:58,238
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.

562
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:06,871
What's that?

563
00:50:07,377 --> 00:50:10,087
HERMIONE: "The Chamber
of Secrets has been opened."

564
00:50:10,088 --> 00:50:12,089
Enemies of the Heir, beware."

565
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:17,090
It's written in blood.

566
00:50:17,262 --> 00:50:17,762
Oh, no.

567
00:50:24,144 --> 00:50:26,937
It's Filch's cat.

568
00:50:26,938 --> 00:50:31,938
It's Mrs. Norris.

569
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:49,543
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

570
00:50:49,544 --> 00:50:52,087
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

571
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:57,088
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

572
00:50:58,678 --> 00:51:00,679
Potter?

573
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,680
What are you...?

574
00:51:06,144 --> 00:51:09,938
Mrs. Norris?

575
00:51:09,939 --> 00:51:14,485
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

576
00:51:14,486 --> 00:51:18,113
FILCH: I'll kill you.

577
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:22,326
- I'll kill you!
DUMBLEDORE: Argus!

578
00:51:22,327 --> 00:51:26,497
Argus, I...

579
00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:31,498
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

580
00:51:31,836 --> 00:51:34,630
Everyone except...

581
00:51:34,631 --> 00:51:38,967
you three.

582
00:51:38,968 --> 00:51:43,639
BOY: Ravenclaws, follow me.

583
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,643
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

584
00:51:47,644 --> 00:51:50,646
Ah. Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

585
00:51:50,647 --> 00:51:55,647
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

586
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:59,113
But how she has been Petrified,
lcannotsay.

587
00:51:59,114 --> 00:52:01,990
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

588
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:04,827
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

589
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:09,123
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

590
00:52:09,124 --> 00:52:14,002
- Rubbish.
- If I might, headmaster?

591
00:52:14,003 --> 00:52:19,003
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

592
00:52:19,342 --> 00:52:21,552
However...

593
00:52:21,553 --> 00:52:24,680
the circumstances are suspicious.

594
00:52:24,681 --> 00:52:29,518
I, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

595
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:31,895
LOCKHART:
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

596
00:52:31,896 --> 00:52:35,524
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

597
00:52:35,525 --> 00:52:38,944
HERMIONE: That's why Ron and I
went looking for him, professor.

598
00:52:38,945 --> 00:52:43,945
We'd just found him when he said...

599
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:48,950
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.

600
00:52:49,205 --> 00:52:54,205
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

601
00:52:55,545 --> 00:53:00,545
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
FILCH: My cat has been Petrified.

602
00:53:01,885 --> 00:53:06,885
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

603
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:13,604
As I understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

604
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:18,400
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

605
00:53:18,401 --> 00:53:20,611
And in the meantime...

606
00:53:20,612 --> 00:53:25,282
I strongly recommend caution...

607
00:53:25,283 --> 00:53:25,783
to all.

608
00:53:38,296 --> 00:53:41,924
HERMIONE: It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

609
00:53:41,925 --> 00:53:44,843
HERMIONE: You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

610
00:53:44,844 --> 00:53:49,765
and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

611
00:53:49,766 --> 00:53:53,143
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?

612
00:53:53,144 --> 00:53:54,770
Are you mad?

613
00:53:54,771 --> 00:53:59,771
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing Voices isn't a good sign.

614
00:54:02,362 --> 00:54:07,362
MAN IN PICTURE:
She's right, you know.

615
00:54:09,118 --> 00:54:11,954
MCGONAGALL: Could I have
your attention, please?

616
00:54:11,955 --> 00:54:16,955
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

617
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:20,963
into water goblets.

618
00:54:20,964 --> 00:54:22,798

Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

621
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:40,770
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. <i>Vera</i> Verto."

622
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,320
<i>Vera Verto!</i>

623
00:54:52,495 --> 00:54:56,498
MCGONAGALL: That wand needs
replacing, Mr. Weasley.

624
00:54:56,499 --> 00:54:58,834
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

625
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:03,835
I was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

626
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:12,014
Very well.

627
00:55:12,015 --> 00:55:14,182
You all know, of course...

628
00:55:14,183 --> 00:55:18,186
that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

629
00:55:18,187 --> 00:55:22,816
by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

630
00:55:22,817 --> 00:55:26,695
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

631
00:55:26,696 --> 00:55:31,696
Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

632
00:55:33,036 --> 00:55:38,036
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

633
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:42,919
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

634
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,547
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

635
00:55:45,548 --> 00:55:48,884
about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

636
00:55:48,885 --> 00:55:53,639
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

637
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:56,141
In other words, pure-bloods.

638
00:55:56,142 --> 00:56:01,142
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

639
00:56:02,357 --> 00:56:04,733
Now, according to legend...

640
00:56:04,734 --> 00:56:08,612
Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this Castle...

641
00:56:08,613 --> 00:56:12,449
known as the Chamber of Secrets.

642
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:17,079
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

643
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,375
until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

644
00:56:21,376 --> 00:56:23,919
The Heir alone...

645
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,755
would be able to open the Chamber...

646
00:56:26,756 --> 00:56:31,635
and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

647
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:35,180
purge the school
of all those who...

648
00:56:35,181 --> 00:56:40,181
in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

649
00:56:40,812 --> 00:56:43,980
Muggle-borns.

650
00:56:43,981 --> 00:56:47,776
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

651
00:56:47,777 --> 00:56:51,822
No such chamber has been found.

652
00:56:51,823 --> 00:56:56,823
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

653
00:56:57,328 --> 00:57:00,122
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

654
00:57:00,123 --> 00:57:04,292
that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

655
00:57:04,293 --> 00:57:08,130
It is said to be the home...

656
00:57:08,131 --> 00:57:13,131
of a monster.

657
00:57:15,471 --> 00:57:19,307
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

658
00:57:19,308 --> 00:57:23,687
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

659
00:57:23,688 --> 00:57:27,691
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it has been opened, that means...

660
00:57:27,692 --> 00:57:31,820
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

661
00:57:31,821 --> 00:57:36,366
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

662
00:57:36,367 --> 00:57:39,202
- If you're talking about Malfoy...
- Of course. You heard him.

663
00:57:39,203 --> 00:57:41,079
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

664
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,874
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

665
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:47,210
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.

666
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:50,172
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

667
00:57:50,173 --> 00:57:54,050
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

668
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:58,388
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

669
00:57:58,389 --> 00:58:00,390
Mind you, it would be difficult.

670
00:58:00,391 --> 00:58:03,602
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

671
00:58:03,603 --> 00:58:08,603
and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

672

Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion.

allows the drinker...

674
00:58:20,411 --> 00:58:24,873
to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

675
00:58:24,874 --> 00:58:28,794
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

676
00:58:28,795 --> 00:58:32,380
- Wickedl Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

677
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:36,384
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more Complicated potion.

678
00:58:36,385 --> 00:58:39,888
HARRY: How long will it take to make?
- A month.

679
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:41,515
A month?

680
00:58:41,516 --> 00:58:45,519
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

681
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,897
he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

682
00:58:48,898 --> 00:58:50,941
I know.

But it's the only plan we've got.

Harry Potter should have listened

Harry Potter should have gone back home

I do not believe...

932

- ...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

Oh.

01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,774
Right. Well, I'll...

935
01:25:15,775 --> 01:25:20,775
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.

I do not think it was you.

is there something
you wish to tell me?

Hey, look, everyone.
It's the Heir of Slytherin.

945
01:26:15,626 --> 01:26:20,626
Be careful.
He's a seriously evil wizard.

946
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:24,009
Oh, come on, Harry. Fred and George
were just having a laugh.

They're the only ones.

to the Chamber of Secrets every night.

maybe you can do something...

958

and not know you did it.

You don't believe that, Harry.
I know you don't.

960
01:27:04,592 --> 01:27:08,929
And if it makes you feel any better,
Malfoy's staying for the holidays too.

961
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:11,389
Why would that make
anyone feel any better?

962
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:15,769
Because in a few days,
the Polyjuice Potion will be ready.

963

In a few days...

964
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:23,230
we may truly know
who is the Heir of Slytherin.

965
01:27:47,093 --> 01:27:50,804
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

966
01:27:50,805 --> 01:27:52,681
Crabbe and Goyle.

967
01:27:52,682 --> 01:27:55,642
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

968
01:27:55,643 --> 01:27:59,187
can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

969
01:27:59,188 --> 01:28:02,107
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.

970
01:28:02,108 --> 01:28:04,818
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

971

Simple, but powerful.

Now, once they're asleep...

973

hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

01:28:13,494 --> 01:28:15,537
and put on their uniforms.

- I've already got mine.

I got this off her robes.

I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

But then you must have some idea
Who's behind it all.

1042
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:20,860
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

Is this yours?

1045
01:34:30,662 --> 01:34:33,414
But my father did say this:

01:34:33,415 --> 01:34:36,501
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

1047

He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

Hang on. I know that name.

Of course. That night I had detention.

My job was to polish the silver
in the trophy room.

over Tom Riddle's trophy.

- He won an award 50 years ago.

No.

that would be to the school.

HAGRID: You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1698
02:38:08,727 --> 02:38:10,811
that day at Diagon Alley.

1699
02:38:10,812 --> 02:38:15,812
You do, do you?

1700
02:38:20,739 --> 02:38:25,739
Why don't you prove it?

1701
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:33,500
Come, Dobby.

1702
02:38:33,501 --> 02:38:34,045
Open it.

1703
02:38:39,049 --> 02:38:40,799
Dobby.

1704
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:44,261
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1705
02:38:44,262 --> 02:38:46,472
What? I didn't give...

1706
02:38:46,473 --> 02:38:50,351
Master has presented Dobby
with Clothes.

1707
02:38:50,352 --> 02:38:55,352
Dobby is free.

1708
02:38:59,986 --> 02:39:04,986
You lost me my servant!

1709
02:39:10,664 --> 02:39:15,664
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1710
02:39:23,718 --> 02:39:26,845
Hm.

1711
02:39:26,846 --> 02:39:30,683
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1712
02:39:30,684 --> 02:39:34,019
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1713
02:39:34,020 --> 02:39:39,020
you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1714
02:39:44,948 --> 02:39:49,948
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1715
02:39:51,204 --> 02:39:56,204
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1716
02:39:57,419 --> 02:40:02,419
Never try to save my life again.

1717
02:40:06,052 --> 02:40:09,346
GIRL 1: Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1718
02:40:09,347 --> 02:40:11,890
GIRL 2: Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

1719
02:40:11,891 --> 02:40:16,145
BOY: Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1720
02:40:16,146 --> 02:40:20,065
Hello.

1721
02:40:20,066 --> 02:40:25,066
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1722
02:40:27,949 --> 02:40:32,949
Harry. It's Hermione.

1723
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:57,640
Uh, um, ahem.

1724
02:40:58,104 --> 02:41:01,982
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

1725
02:41:01,983 --> 02:41:04,777
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1726
02:41:04,778 --> 02:41:07,154
We had loads of help from you.

1727
02:41:07,155 --> 02:41:10,532
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

1728
02:41:10,533 --> 02:41:12,201
[TAPPING ON GLASS]

1729
02:41:12,202 --> 02:41:17,202
Could I have your attention, please?

1730
02:41:19,334 --> 02:41:22,002
Before we begin the feast...

1731
02:41:22,003 --> 02:41:27,003
let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1732
02:41:28,468 --> 02:41:32,721
whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1733
02:41:32,722 --> 02:41:37,722
to all who had been Petrified.

1734
02:41:45,944 --> 02:41:49,071
Also, in light of the recent events...

1735
02:41:49,072 --> 02:41:51,448
as a school treat...

1736
02:41:51,449 --> 02:41:56,449
all exams have been canceled.

1737
02:41:58,039 --> 02:41:58,539
<i>Oh, no.</i>

1738
02:42:16,558 --> 02:42:21,558
Sorry I'm late.

1739
02:42:24,691 --> 02:42:29,403
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and Confused.

1740
02:42:29,404 --> 02:42:34,404
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1741
02:42:48,506 --> 02:42:53,506
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry, and Ron...

1742
02:42:54,721 --> 02:42:58,307
and Hermione, of course...

1743
02:42:58,308 --> 02:43:02,561
I would still be you-know-where...

1744
02:43:02,562 --> 02:43:07,562
so I'd just like to say thanks.

1745
02:43:15,575 --> 02:43:20,575
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.

1746
02:44:21,657 --> 02:44:56,657
