1
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,225
<I>I killed Sirius Black!</I>

2
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,656
<I>He's back.</I>

3
00:00:59,787 --> 00:01:06,942
HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE

4
00:02:55,668 --> 00:02:58,546
<I>The police are</I>
<I>continuing with the investigation...</I>

5
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,755
<I>...into the cause</I>
<I>of the Millennium Bridge disaster.</I>

6
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:04,634
<I>Traffic has been halted</I>
<I>as police search for survivors.</I>

7
00:03:04,634 --> 00:03:06,469
<I>The surrounding area remains closed.</I>

8
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:09,636
<I>The mayor has urged Londoners</I>
<I>to remain calm...</I>

9
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,645
"Harry Potter. "

10
00:03:16,645 --> 00:03:18,388
Who's Harry Potter?

11
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,933
Oh, no one.

12
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:23,860
Bit of a tosser, really.

13
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,197
Funny, that paper of yours.

14
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:30,992
Couple nights ago,
I could've sworn I saw a picture move.

15
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:33,779
- Really?
- Thought I was going around the twist.

16
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:45,255
- Hey, I was wondering...
- Eleven. That's when I get off.

17
00:03:45,255 --> 00:03:48,042
You can tell me all about
that tosser Harry Potter.

18
00:04:38,931 --> 00:04:41,349
You've been reckless this summer, Harry.

19
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,638
I like riding around on trains.

20
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:46,803
Takes my mind off things.

21
00:04:48,315 --> 00:04:50,400
Rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?

22
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,903
The tale is thrilling,
if I say so myself.

23
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:56,614
But now is not the time to tell it.

24
00:04:56,614 --> 00:04:58,191
Take my arm.

25
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,112
Do as I say.

26
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,880
I just Apparated, didn't I?

27
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,217
Indeed. Quite successfully too,
I might add.

28
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,011
Most people vomit the first time.

29
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:21,754
I can't imagine why.

30
00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:33,399
Welcome to the
charming village of Budleigh Babberton.

31
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,861
Harry, I assume, right about now, you're
wondering why I brought you here.

32
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:39,738
Am I right?

33
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:43,107
Actually, sir, after all these years,
I just sort of go with it.

34
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:49,496
Wands out, Harry.

35
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,384
Horace?

36
00:06:14,521 --> 00:06:15,932
Horace?

37
00:07:07,988 --> 00:07:09,482
Merlin's beard!

38
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:13,118
No need to disfigure me, Albus.

39
00:07:13,118 --> 00:07:16,818
Well, I must say you
make a very convincing armchair, Horace.

40
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:22,159
It's all in the upholstery. I come by the
stuffing naturally. What gave me away?

41
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:25,421
Dragon's blood.

42
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:28,716
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, introductions.

43
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:32,886
Harry, I'd like you to meet
an old friend and colleague of mine...

44
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,512
...Horace Slughorn.

45
00:07:34,512 --> 00:07:36,180
Horace...

46
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,968
...well, you know who this is.

47
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:41,842
Harry Potter.

48
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:46,607
What's with all the theatrics, Horace?

49
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:49,234
You weren't, by any chance,
waiting for someone else?

50
00:07:49,234 --> 00:07:52,154
Someone else?
I'm sure I don't know what you mean.

51
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:55,782
All right, the Death Eaters have been
trying to recruit me for over a year.

52
00:07:55,782 --> 00:07:57,284
Do you know what that's like?

53
00:07:57,284 --> 00:08:01,413
You can only say no so many times, so
I never stay anywhere more than a week.

54
00:08:01,413 --> 00:08:03,707
Muggles who own this
are in the Canary Islands.

55
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:08,583
Well, I think we should put it back
in order for them, don't you? Mind.

56
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:45,076
That was fun.

57
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,080
- Do you mind if I use the loo?
- No, of course.

58
00:08:50,417 --> 00:08:53,253
Don't think I don't know
why you're here, Albus.

59
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:58,757
The answer's still no.
Absolutely and unequivocally, no.

60
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:09,217
You're very like your father.

61
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:13,396
- Except for the eyes. You have your...
- My mother's eyes. Yeah.

62
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:17,275
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright, your mother.

63
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:20,780
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.

64
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,533
One of my best friends is Muggle-born.
Best in our year.

65
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,743
Please don't think I'm prejudiced.
No, no.

66
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:30,121
Your mother was one of my
absolute favorites. Look, there she is.

67
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:31,913
Right at the front.

68
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:43,550
All mine. Each and every one.

69
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,626
Ex-students, I mean.

70
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:52,265
<I>You recognize Barnabas Cuffe,</I>
<I>editor of The Daily Prophet.</I>

71
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:55,812
Always takes my owl,
should I wish to register an opinion...

72
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,092
...on the news of the day.

73
00:09:57,981 --> 00:10:01,109
Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies.

74
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,820
Free tickets whenever I want them.

75
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,737
Of course, I haven't been
to a match in some time.

76
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:10,158
Ah, yes.

77
00:10:10,158 --> 00:10:12,494
Regulus Black.

78
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:16,623
You no doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago.

79
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:19,334
I taught the whole Black family,
except Sirius.

80
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:21,712
It's a shame. Talented boy.

81
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:27,001
I got Regulus when he came along,
of course, but I'd have liked the set.

82
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:29,081
Horace?

83
00:10:29,802 --> 00:10:31,344
Do you mind if I take this?

84
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:39,728
- I do love knitting patterns.
- Yes, of course. But you're not leaving?

85
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:43,023
I think I know a lost cause
when I see one. Regrettable.

86
00:10:43,023 --> 00:10:45,484
I would have considered it
a personal triumph...

87
00:10:45,484 --> 00:10:48,612
...had you consented to return
to Hogwarts. Oh, well.

88
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:51,613
You're like my friend Mr. Potter here,
one of a kind.

89
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,948
Well, bye-bye, Horace.

90
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:56,273
Bye.

91
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:09,965
All right. I'll do it.

92
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:14,720
But I want Professor Merrythought's old
office, not the water closet I had before.

93
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,931
And I expect a raise.
These are mad times we live in. Mad!

94
00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:22,349
They are indeed.

95
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:27,645
Sir, exactly what was all that about?

96
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:33,070
You are talented, famous and powerful.
Everything Horace values.

97
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,656
Professor Slughorn is gonna try
to collect you, Harry.

98
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:39,200
You would be his crowning jewel.

99
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,740
That's why he's returning to Hogwarts.
And it's crucial he should return.

100
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:48,752
I fear I may have stolen
a wondrous night from you, Harry.

101
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:53,965
She was, truthfully, very pretty, the girl.

102
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:57,594
It's all right, sir. I'll go back tomorrow,
make some excuse.

103
00:11:57,594 --> 00:12:01,431
Oh, you'll not be returning
to Little Whinging tonight, Harry.

104
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:04,600
But, sir, what about Hedwig?
And my trunk?

105
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,269
Both are waiting for you.

106
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,301
Hedwig.

107
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,133
Mum?

108
00:12:47,515 --> 00:12:49,308
Ginny, what is it?

109
00:12:49,308 --> 00:12:51,727
I was only wondering
when Harry got here.

110
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:55,147
- What? Harry? Harry who?
- Harry Potter, of course.

111
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:58,484
I think I'd know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldn't I?

112
00:12:58,484 --> 00:13:01,982
- His trunk's in the kitchen, and his owl.
- No, dear, I seriously doubt that.

113
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:06,449
Harry? Did someone say "Harry"?

114
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:08,577
Me, nosy. Is he up there with you?

115
00:13:08,577 --> 00:13:11,789
Of course not. I'd know if my best friend
was in my room, wouldn't I?

116
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:14,458
- Is that an owl?
- You haven't seen him, have you?

117
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,376
He's wandering about the house.

118
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:18,378
- Really?
- Really.

119
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:19,955
Harry!

120
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:27,885
Harry!

121
00:13:29,805 --> 00:13:33,090
What a lovely surprise.

122
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:37,688
Why didn't you let us know
you were coming?

123
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:40,691
- I didn't know. Dumbledore.
- Oh, that man.

124
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,932
But then, what would we do
without him?

125
00:13:44,193 --> 00:13:46,862
Got a bit of toothpaste.

126
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:55,663
So when did you get here?

127
00:13:55,663 --> 00:13:57,371
A few days ago.

128
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:00,615
Though for a while,
I wasn't sure I was coming.

129
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:05,004
Mum sort of lost it last week.

130
00:14:05,004 --> 00:14:08,007
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts.

131
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:09,551
That it's too dangerous.

132
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:12,553
- Oh, come on.
- She's not alone.

133
00:14:12,553 --> 00:14:16,056
Even my parents, and they're Muggles,
know something bad's happening.

134
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:20,227
Anyway, Dad stepped in,
told her she was being barmy...

135
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,635
...and it took a few days,
but she came around.

136
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:27,895
But this is Hogwarts we're talking about.
It's Dumbledore. What could be safer?

137
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:31,772
There's been a lot of talk recently that...

138
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:34,408
...Dumbledore's got a bit old.

139
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,368
Rubbish! Well, he's only...

140
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:38,120
What is he?

141
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,322
Hundred and fifty?
Give or take a few years.

142
00:15:01,391 --> 00:15:05,395
Cissy! You can't do this!
He can't be trusted!

143
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,022
The Dark Lord trusts him.

144
00:15:07,022 --> 00:15:10,603
- The Dark Lord's mistaken.
- Pfft.

145
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:42,128
Run along, Wormtail.

146
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:47,637
I know I ought not to be here.

147
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:51,689
The Dark Lord himself
forbade me to speak of this.

148
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,524
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.

149
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:58,771
Put it down, Bella.
We mustn't touch what isn't ours.

150
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:06,786
As it so happens,
I'm aware of your situation, Narcissa.

151
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:07,948
You?

152
00:16:09,038 --> 00:16:11,327
The Dark Lord told you?

153
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:14,454
Your sister doubts me.

154
00:16:15,503 --> 00:16:18,506
Understandable. Over the years
I've played my part well.

155
00:16:18,506 --> 00:16:22,253
So well, I've deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all time.

156
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:27,764
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.

157
00:16:27,764 --> 00:16:29,849
I don't doubt you, Severus.

158
00:16:29,849 --> 00:16:33,016
You should be honored, Cissy.
As should Draco.

159
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,313
He's just a boy.

160
00:16:40,192 --> 00:16:43,193
I can't change the Dark Lord's mind.

161
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:48,487
But it might be possible
for me to help Draco.

162
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:53,160
- Severus.
- Swear to it.

163
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:59,658
Make the Unbreakable Vow.

164
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:06,759
It's just empty words.

165
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,137
He'll give it his best effort.

166
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:12,510
But when it matters most...

167
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:18,353
...he'll just slither back into his hole.

168
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:23,439
Coward.

169
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:30,069
Take out your wand.

170
00:17:43,252 --> 00:17:44,586
Will you...

171
00:17:44,586 --> 00:17:46,797
...Severus Snape...

172
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:49,882
...watch over Draco Malfoy...

173
00:17:49,882 --> 00:17:54,710
...as he attempts to fulfill
the Dark Lord's wishes?

174
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,756
I will.

175
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:02,806
And will you,
to the best of your ability...

176
00:18:03,478 --> 00:18:05,685
...protect him from harm?

177
00:18:07,149 --> 00:18:08,429
I will.

178
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:13,019
And if Draco should fail...

179
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:18,952
...will you yourself carry out the deed...

180
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:23,947
...the Dark Lord
has ordered Draco to perform?

181
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:30,705
I will.

182
00:18:53,484 --> 00:18:56,654
Step up! Step up!
We've got Fainting Fancies!

183
00:18:56,654 --> 00:18:57,864
Nosebleed Nougats!

184
00:18:57,864 --> 00:19:00,947
- And just in time for school...
- Puking Pastilles!

185
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,989
- Into the cauldron, handsome.
- Into the cauldron, handsome.

186
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,011
- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.
- A real money spinner, that.

187
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:24,305
Handy if you need
to make a quick getaway.

188
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:26,223
- Hello, ladies.
- Hello, ladies.

189
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:29,685
- Love potions, eh?
- Yeah, they really do work.

190
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:33,189
Then again, the way we hear it, sis,
you're doing just fine on your own.

191
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:34,523
Meaning?

192
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:37,109
Are you not
currently dating Dean Thomas?

193
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,853
It's none of your business.

194
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,825
How much for this?

195
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:47,369
- Five Galleons.
- Five Galleons.

196
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:49,662
- How much for me?
- Five Galleons.

197
00:19:49,662 --> 00:19:51,247
I'm your brother.

198
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:53,287
- Ten Galleons.
- Ten Galleons.

199
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,869
Come on, let's go.

200
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:00,749
Hi, Ron.

201
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,233
How are Fred and George
doing it? Half the Alley's closed down.

202
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:23,277
Fred reckons
people need a laugh these days.

203
00:20:23,277 --> 00:20:25,233
I reckon he's right.

204
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,608
Oh, no.

205
00:20:29,241 --> 00:20:31,399
Everyone got their wands
from Ollivander's.

206
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:45,255
Harry?

207
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:49,344
Is it me, or do Draco and Mummy
look like two people...

208
00:20:49,344 --> 00:20:51,052
...who don't want to be followed?

209
00:22:36,277 --> 00:22:37,605
<I>Quibbler.</I>

210
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:40,947
<I>Quibbler.</I>

211
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:47,704
He's lovely. They've been known
to sing on Boxing Day, you know.

212
00:22:47,704 --> 00:22:50,076
<I>- Quibbler?</I>
<I>- Oh, please.</I>

213
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,002
- What's a Wrackspurt?
- They're invisible creatures.

214
00:22:54,002 --> 00:22:57,169
They float in your ears
and make your brain go fuzzy.

215
00:22:57,714 --> 00:22:59,256
<I>Quibbler.</I>

216
00:23:09,725 --> 00:23:12,645
So, what was Draco doing
with that weird-looking cabinet?

217
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:14,521
And who were all those people?

218
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:17,815
Don't you see?
It was a ceremony, an initiation.

219
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,902
Stop it, Harry.
I know where you're going.

220
00:23:19,902 --> 00:23:22,571
It's happened. He's one of them.

221
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:24,065
One of what?

222
00:23:24,823 --> 00:23:28,452
Harry is under the impression
Draco Malfoy is now a Death Eater.

223
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:30,579
You're barking.

224
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:32,872
What would You-Know-Who
want with Malfoy?

225
00:23:32,872 --> 00:23:37,085
Well, then what's he doing in Borgin
and Burkes? Browsing for furniture?

226
00:23:37,085 --> 00:23:39,128
It's a creepy shop. He's a creepy bloke.

227
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:43,174
Look, his father is a Death Eater.
It only makes sense.

228
00:23:43,174 --> 00:23:44,926
Hermione saw it with her own eyes.

229
00:23:44,926 --> 00:23:48,258
I told you, I don't know what I saw.

230
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:51,514
I need some air.

231
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:12,023
Don't worry. When we get
to Hogwarts, we'll sort it out.

232
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:35,848
- What was that? Blaise?
- Don't know.

233
00:24:35,848 --> 00:24:39,143
Relax, boys. It's probably just
a first-year messing around.

234
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:42,511
Come on, Draco. Sit down.
We'll be at Hogwarts soon.

235
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:56,159
Hogwarts.
What a pathetic excuse for a school.

236
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,327
I'd pitch myself off
the Astronomy Tower...

237
00:24:58,327 --> 00:25:00,621
...if I had to continue
for another two years.

238
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:01,950
What's that supposed to mean?

239
00:25:03,207 --> 00:25:07,039
Let's just say you won't see me wasting
my time in Charms class next year.

240
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:10,665
Amused, Blaise?

241
00:25:12,132 --> 00:25:14,539
We'll see just who's laughing in the end.

242
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:40,444
You two go on.
I wanna check something.

243
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:44,078
Where's Harry?

244
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:47,032
He's probably already on the platform.
Come on.

245
00:26:02,722 --> 00:26:06,392
Didn't Mummy ever tell you
it was rude to eavesdrop, Potter?

246
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:07,970
<I>Petrificus Totalus.</I>

247
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:24,357
...she was dead before you could wipe
the drool off your chin.

248
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:33,039
That's for my father.
Enjoy your ride back to London.

249
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,618
<I>Finite.</I>

250
00:27:24,757 --> 00:27:26,425
- Hello, Harry.
- Luna!

251
00:27:26,425 --> 00:27:31,134
- How'd you know where I was?
- Wrackspurts. Your head's full of them.

252
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:40,688
Sorry I made you miss
the carriages, by the way, Luna.

253
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:44,025
That's all right.
It was like being with a friend.

254
00:27:44,025 --> 00:27:46,486
Oh, I am your friend, Luna.

255
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:48,445
That's nice.

256
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:51,824
About time. I've been looking
all over for you two.

257
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:54,910
Right. Names?

258
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,454
Professor Flitwick,
you've known me for five years.

259
00:27:57,454 --> 00:27:59,577
No exceptions, Potter.

260
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:02,042
Who are those people?

261
00:28:02,042 --> 00:28:04,502
Aurors. For security.

262
00:28:04,502 --> 00:28:06,254
What's this cane here, then?

263
00:28:06,254 --> 00:28:08,673
It's not a cane, you cretin.
It's a walking stick.

264
00:28:08,673 --> 00:28:12,670
And what exactly would you
be wanting with a...?

265
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:17,097
Could be construed
as an offensive weapon.

266
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:22,339
It's all right, Mr. Filch.
I can vouch for Mr. Malfoy.

267
00:28:29,735 --> 00:28:31,691
Nice face, Potter.

268
00:28:38,243 --> 00:28:40,745
Would you like me to fix it for you?

269
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:44,708
Personally, I think you look
a bit more devil-may-care this way...

270
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,667
...but it's up to you.

271
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,128
Well, have you ever fixed a nose before?

272
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:52,828
No, but I've done several toes,
and how different are they, really?

273
00:28:53,882 --> 00:28:57,797
Um... Okay, yeah. Give it a go.

274
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:02,261
<I>- Episkey.</I>
<I>- Ah!</I>

275
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:11,563
- How do I look?
- Exceptionally ordinary.

276
00:29:12,692 --> 00:29:14,067
Brilliant.

277
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,489
Don't worry. He'll be here in a minute.

278
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:30,249
Will you stop eating?

279
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:32,668
Your best friend is missing!

280
00:29:32,668 --> 00:29:35,918
Oi. Turn around, you lunatic.

281
00:29:38,716 --> 00:29:40,210
He's covered in blood again.

282
00:29:40,843 --> 00:29:45,097
- Why is it he's always covered in blood?
- Looks like it's his own this time.

283
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:47,141
Where have you been?

284
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:49,768
- What happened to your face?
- Later.

285
00:29:49,768 --> 00:29:51,393
What've I missed?

286
00:29:51,937 --> 00:29:55,900
Sorting Hat urged us all to be brave
and strong in these troubled times.

287
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,433
Easy for it to say, huh?
It's a hat, isn't it?

288
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:09,162
Very best of evenings to you all.

289
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:10,193
Thanks.

290
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:17,252
First off, let me introduce
the newest member of our staff...

291
00:30:17,252 --> 00:30:19,494
...Horace Slughorn.

292
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:25,427
Professor Slughorn, I'm happy to say...

293
00:30:25,427 --> 00:30:29,889
...has agreed to resume
his old post as Potions Master.

294
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:32,975
Meanwhile, the post of
Defense Against the Dark Arts...

295
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:35,186
...will be taken by Professor Snape.

296
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:36,645
Snape?

297
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:44,486
Now, as you know...

298
00:30:44,486 --> 00:30:48,323
...each and every one of you was searched
upon your arrival here tonight.

299
00:30:48,323 --> 00:30:50,315
And you have the right to know why.

300
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:54,870
Once there was a young man,
who, like you...

301
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,707
...sat in this very hall...

302
00:30:57,707 --> 00:31:02,334
...walked this castle's corridors,
slept under its roof.

303
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:07,467
He seemed to all the world
a student like any other.

304
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:09,008
His name?

305
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:11,797
Tom Riddle.

306
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,635
Today, of course...

307
00:31:19,186 --> 00:31:22,520
...he's known all over the world
by another name.

308
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:29,070
Which is why, as I stand looking out
upon you all tonight...

309
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,442
...I'm reminded of a sobering fact.

310
00:31:32,615 --> 00:31:35,910
Every day, every hour...

311
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,036
...this very minute, perhaps...

312
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:42,365
...dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle's walls.

313
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,540
But in the end,
their greatest weapon is you.

314
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:54,714
Just something to think about.

315
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,547
Now, off to bed. Pip-pip.

316
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:01,014
That was cheerful.

317
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:11,058
History of Magic is upstairs,
ladies, not down.

318
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:16,855
Mr. Davies! Mr. Davies!
That is the girls' lavatory.

319
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,070
Potter.

320
00:32:22,412 --> 00:32:24,369
Oh, this can't be good.

321
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:29,042
Enjoying ourselves, are we?

322
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:33,164
- I had a free period this morning.
- So I noticed.

323
00:32:33,673 --> 00:32:36,258
I would think you would want to
fill it with Potions.

324
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:38,927
Or is it no longer your ambition
to become an Auror?

325
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:43,515
It was, but I was told I had to
get an "Outstanding" in my O.W.L.

326
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:46,560
So you did, when Professor Snape
was teaching Potions.

327
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:51,313
However, Professor Slughorn is perfectly
happy to accept N.E.W.T. s students...

328
00:32:51,313 --> 00:32:53,105
...with "Exceeds Expectations. "

329
00:32:53,607 --> 00:32:55,443
Brilliant. Um...

330
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:58,070
- Well, I'll head there straightaway.
- Oh, good, good.

331
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:02,981
Potter, take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.

332
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:06,244
I don't wanna take Potions.

333
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:08,949
This is Quidditch trials coming up.
I need to practice.

334
00:33:10,206 --> 00:33:12,333
Attention to detail
in the preparation...

335
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,622
...is the prerequisite of all planning.

336
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:21,585
Harry, my boy, I was beginning to worry.
We've brought someone with us, I see.

337
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:23,415
Ron Weasley, sir.

338
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:26,597
But I'm dead awful at Potions,
a menace, actually.

339
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:28,849
- I'm gonna...
- Nonsense, we'll sort you out.

340
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:32,102
Any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine.
Get your books out.

341
00:33:32,102 --> 00:33:34,813
I haven't actually got
my book yet, and nor has Ron.

342
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,690
Get what you want from the cupboard.

343
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,194
Now, as I was saying,
I prepared some concoctions this morning.

344
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:44,143
Any ideas what these might be?

345
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,230
- Yes, Miss...?
- Granger, sir.

346
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:56,125
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

347
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,830
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

348
00:34:02,464 --> 00:34:04,299
It's terribly tricky to make.

349
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:06,509
And this is Amortentia...

350
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:08,917
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

351
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:13,678
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

352
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:16,968
For example, I smell...

353
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:21,941
...freshly mown grass,
and new parchment, and...

354
00:34:21,941 --> 00:34:25,274
...spearmint toothpaste.

355
00:34:26,695 --> 00:34:30,323
Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

356
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:35,495
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

357
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:42,162
And for that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

358
00:34:47,715 --> 00:34:50,885
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

359
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:52,762
Oh, yes.

360
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:55,515
What you see before you,
ladies and gentlemen...

361
00:34:55,515 --> 00:35:01,353
...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

362
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:03,772
But it is more commonly referred to as...

363
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:09,063
- Liquid luck.
- Yes, Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

364
00:35:09,569 --> 00:35:12,569
Desperately tricky to make,
disastrous should you get it wrong.

365
00:35:13,364 --> 00:35:18,358
One sip and you will find
that all of your endeavors succeed.

366
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:22,904
At least until the effects wear off.

367
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:27,752
So this is what I offer each of you today.

368
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:32,757
One tiny vial of liquid luck to the student
who, in the hour that remains...

369
00:35:32,757 --> 00:35:37,512
...manages to brew an acceptable
Draught of Living Death...

370
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:40,931
...the recipes for which can be found
on page 10 of your books.

371
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:44,768
I should point out, however, only once did
a student manage to brew a potion...

372
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:48,102
...of sufficient quality to claim this prize.

373
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,931
Nevertheless, good luck to you all.

374
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,608
Let the brewing commence.

375
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,417
this book is the property of
the half blood prince

376
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,910
cut the sopophorus bean

377
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:31,262
How did you do that?

378
00:36:31,813 --> 00:36:34,149
You crush it. Don't cut it.

379
00:36:34,149 --> 00:36:36,818
No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

380
00:36:36,818 --> 00:36:38,644
No, really.

381
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:19,313
Merlin's beard! It is perfect.

382
00:37:20,818 --> 00:37:24,020
So perfect I daresay
one drop would kill us all.

383
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:29,451
So here we are, then, as promised.

384
00:37:29,451 --> 00:37:32,829
One vial of Felix Felicis.

385
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:34,869
Congratulations.

386
00:37:35,372 --> 00:37:38,124
Use it well.

387
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:08,403
Harry, you got my message. Come in.

388
00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:11,615
How are you?

389
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:13,325
I'm fine, sir.

390
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:14,570
Enjoying your classes?

391
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,863
I know Professor Slughorn
is most impressed with you.

392
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,869
I think he overestimates my abilities, sir.

393
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:23,698
Do you?

394
00:38:24,251 --> 00:38:25,496
Definitely.

395
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:30,340
What about your activities
outside the classroom?

396
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,718
- Sir?
- Well, I notice you spend...

397
00:38:33,718 --> 00:38:36,514
...a great deal of time with Miss Granger.

398
00:38:36,514 --> 00:38:37,932
I can't help wondering...

399
00:38:37,932 --> 00:38:43,104
Oh, no, no. I mean, she's brilliant,
and we're friends, but, no.

400
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:46,105
Forgive me. I was merely being curious.

401
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,275
But enough chitchat.

402
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:52,858
You must be wondering
why I summoned you here tonight.

403
00:38:53,446 --> 00:38:56,281
The answer lies here.

404
00:38:57,283 --> 00:38:59,619
What you are looking at are memories.

405
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:03,622
In this case,
pertaining to one individual, Voldemort...

406
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:06,078
...or, as he was known then, Tom Riddle.

407
00:39:09,128 --> 00:39:13,132
This vial contains
the most particular memory...

408
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:15,338
...of the day I first met him.

409
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:19,463
I'd like you to see it, if you would.

410
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:59,174
<I>I admit some confusion upon</I>
<I>receiving your letter, Mr. Dumbledore.</I>

411
00:39:59,174 --> 00:40:01,677
wool's orphan

412
00:40:01,677 --> 00:40:05,306
In all the years Tom's been here,
he's never once had a family visitor.

413
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:09,054
There have been incidents
with the other children. Nasty things.

414
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:13,636
Tom, you have a visitor.

415
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:15,848
How do you do, Tom?

416
00:40:23,364 --> 00:40:24,609
Don't.

417
00:40:32,414 --> 00:40:35,709
- You're the doctor, aren't you?
- No.

418
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:37,748
I am a professor.

419
00:40:38,462 --> 00:40:40,464
I don't believe you.

420
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:42,455
She wants me looked at.

421
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:45,426
They think I'm different.

422
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:47,094
Well, perhaps they're right.

423
00:40:47,094 --> 00:40:48,721
I'm not mad.

424
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:52,224
Hogwarts is not a place for mad people.

425
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,217
Hogwarts is a school.

426
00:40:54,977 --> 00:40:56,139
A school of magic.

427
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:03,400
You can do things, can't you, Tom?

428
00:41:04,527 --> 00:41:07,197
Things other children can't.

429
00:41:08,573 --> 00:41:11,527
I can make things move
without touching them.

430
00:41:12,452 --> 00:41:16,035
I can make animals do what I want
without training them.

431
00:41:16,831 --> 00:41:20,366
I can make bad things happen
to people who are mean to me.

432
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:22,959
I can make them hurt...

433
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:25,129
...if I want.

434
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:27,716
Who are you?

435
00:41:27,716 --> 00:41:29,922
Well, I'm like you, Tom.

436
00:41:31,094 --> 00:41:32,553
I'm different.

437
00:41:33,597 --> 00:41:35,008
Prove it.

438
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:46,437
I think there's something in your wardrobe
trying to get out, Tom.

439
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,121
Thievery is not tolerated at Hogwarts,
Tom.

440
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:05,961
At Hogwarts, you'll be taught not only
how to use magic, but how to control it.

441
00:42:05,961 --> 00:42:07,123
You understand me?

442
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,628
I can speak to snakes too.

443
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:16,676
They find me.

444
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,848
Whisper things.

445
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:22,967
Is that normal for someone like me?

446
00:42:44,038 --> 00:42:47,500
Did you know, sir? Then?

447
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,122
Did I know I'd just met the most
dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.

448
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:55,836
If I had, I...

449
00:42:57,467 --> 00:43:00,095
Over time, while here at Hogwarts...

450
00:43:00,095 --> 00:43:03,598
...Tom Riddle grew close
to one particular teacher.

451
00:43:03,598 --> 00:43:05,424
Can you guess
who that teacher might be?

452
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,981
You didn't bring Professor Slughorn back
simply to teach Potions, did you?

453
00:43:11,981 --> 00:43:14,191
No, I did not.

454
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:18,023
You see, Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.

455
00:43:19,028 --> 00:43:21,072
And he will not give it up easily.

456
00:43:21,072 --> 00:43:24,450
You said Professor Slughorn
would try to collect me.

457
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:25,695
I did.

458
00:43:26,411 --> 00:43:28,403
Do you want me to let him?

459
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:31,164
Yes.

460
00:44:55,328 --> 00:44:57,205
All right. Um...

461
00:44:57,205 --> 00:45:00,458
This morning, I'm gonna be
putting you all through a few drills...

462
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,581
...just to assess your strengths.

463
00:45:03,294 --> 00:45:05,463
Quiet! Please!

464
00:45:05,463 --> 00:45:06,625
Shut it!

465
00:45:10,468 --> 00:45:13,387
Thanks. All right. Um...

466
00:45:13,387 --> 00:45:15,680
Just because you
made the team last year...

467
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,634
...does not guarantee you a spot this year.
Is that clear?

468
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:22,425
Good.

469
00:45:31,153 --> 00:45:33,359
No hard feelings, Weasley, all right?

470
00:45:33,906 --> 00:45:35,282
Hard feelings?

471
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:38,994
Yeah, I'll be going out for Keeper as well.
It's nothing personal.

472
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:41,830
Really? Strapping guy like you?

473
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:44,582
You've got more of a Beater's build,
don't you think?

474
00:45:44,582 --> 00:45:46,990
Keepers need to be quick, agile.

475
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,338
Oh, I like my chances.

476
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:54,300
Say, think you could introduce me
to your friend Granger?

477
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:58,463
Wouldn't mind getting on
a first-name basis, know what I mean?

478
00:46:10,773 --> 00:46:12,650
Come on, Weasley!

479
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,358
- Come on, Ron!
- Go on, Weasley!

480
00:46:15,904 --> 00:46:18,949
- Go on, Weasley!
- Yeah, Ron!

481
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:20,194
Go on, Cormac!

482
00:46:36,716 --> 00:46:38,792
Come on, Ron!

483
00:46:49,477 --> 00:46:51,351
Come on, Ron.

484
00:47:09,245 --> 00:47:10,408
<I>Confundus.</I>

485
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:28,836
Isn't he brilliant?

486
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:35,438
I have to admit, I thought
I was gonna miss that last one.

487
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:38,648
I hope Cormac's not taking it too hard.

488
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:41,685
He's got a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.

489
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,770
He's vile.

490
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:52,161
Have you ever heard of this spell?
Sectumsempra?

491
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,413
No, I haven't.

492
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:57,708
And if you had a shred of self-respect,
you'd hand that book in.

493
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,336
Not bloody likely. He's top of the class.

494
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:04,499
He's even better than you, Hermione.
Slughorn thinks he's a genius.

495
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,912
What?

496
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:10,636
I'd like to know whose that book was.
Let's have a look.

497
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:12,131
No.

498
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:14,920
Why not?

499
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:17,268
The binding is fragile.

500
00:48:17,268 --> 00:48:19,888
- The binding is fragile?
- Yeah.

501
00:48:24,149 --> 00:48:25,901
- Who's the Half-Blood Prince?
- Who?

502
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:29,649
That's what it says right here: "This book
is property of the Half-Blood Prince. "

503
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:50,508
<I>For weeks you carry around</I>
<I>this book, practically sleep with it...</I>

504
00:48:50,508 --> 00:48:52,968
<I>...yet you have no desire to find out</I>
<I>who he is?</I>

505
00:48:52,968 --> 00:48:56,555
I didn't say I wasn't curious,
and I don't sleep with it.

506
00:48:56,555 --> 00:48:57,765
Well, it's true.

507
00:48:57,765 --> 00:49:01,685
I like a nice chat before I go to bed.
Now all you do is read that bloody book.

508
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:03,677
It's just like being with Hermione.

509
00:49:04,979 --> 00:49:07,649
Well, I was curious, so I went to...

510
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:10,187
- The library.
- The library. And?

511
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,904
And nothing.

512
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:16,115
I couldn't find a reference anywhere
to a Half-Blood Prince.

513
00:49:16,115 --> 00:49:18,367
- There we go. That settles it, then.
- Filius!

514
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:20,869
I was hoping to find you
in the Three Broomsticks!

515
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:25,531
No, emergency choir practice,
I'm afraid, Horace.

516
00:49:29,044 --> 00:49:31,796
Does anyone fancy a Butterbeer?

517
00:49:31,796 --> 00:49:34,215
A chum of mine
was sledging down Claxby Hill.

518
00:49:34,215 --> 00:49:38,010
We had a very long, homemade,
Norwegian-style sledge...

519
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:40,466
No, not there. Over here.

520
00:49:41,097 --> 00:49:42,639
No, sit beside me.

521
00:49:44,392 --> 00:49:45,671
Okay.

522
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:48,687
Something to drink?

523
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:51,225
Three Butterbeers,
and some ginger in mine, please.

524
00:50:02,991 --> 00:50:04,950
Oh, bloody hell.

525
00:50:07,914 --> 00:50:10,083
Slick git.

526
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,752
Honestly, Ronald,
they're only holding hands.

527
00:50:15,587 --> 00:50:16,832
And snogging.

528
00:50:17,506 --> 00:50:20,634
- I'd like to leave.
- What?

529
00:50:20,634 --> 00:50:22,386
You can't be serious.

530
00:50:22,386 --> 00:50:24,930
- That happens to be my sister.
- So?

531
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:28,843
What if she looked over here and saw you
snogging me? You expect her to leave?

532
00:50:30,143 --> 00:50:32,770
- Hey, my boy!
- Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.

533
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:34,939
And you, and you.

534
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:36,899
So, what brings you here?

535
00:50:36,899 --> 00:50:41,779
The Three Broomsticks and I go way back,
further than I care to admit.

536
00:50:41,779 --> 00:50:45,407
I can remember
when it was One Broomstick.

537
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:48,910
All hands on deck, Granger.
Listen, my boy, in the old days...

538
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:52,497
...I used to throw together
the occasional supper party...

539
00:50:52,497 --> 00:50:54,875
...for the select student or two.

540
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:58,741
- Would you be game?
- I'd consider it an honor, sir.

541
00:51:00,171 --> 00:51:02,377
You would be welcome too, Granger.

542
00:51:03,174 --> 00:51:07,919
- I'd be delighted, sir.
- Splendid. Look for my owl.

543
00:51:08,804 --> 00:51:10,761
Good to see you, Wallenby.

544
00:51:15,685 --> 00:51:17,393
What are you playing at?

545
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:21,692
Dumbledore's asked me
to get to know him.

546
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:23,819
- Get to know him?
- I don't know.

547
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:27,567
It must be important.
If it wasn't, Dumbledore wouldn't ask.

548
00:51:33,161 --> 00:51:35,284
Got a little bit...

549
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:48,216
Katie, you don't know what it could be.

550
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:49,843
- Harry.
- What?

551
00:51:49,843 --> 00:51:53,342
Did you hear what she said back
at the pub about me and her snogging?

552
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:55,881
As if.

553
00:52:02,313 --> 00:52:05,646
I warned her.
I warned her not to touch it.

554
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:29,879
Don't get any closer.
Get back, all of you.

555
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:47,220
Do not touch that, except by
the wrappings. Do you understand?

556
00:53:00,701 --> 00:53:03,454
You're sure Katie did not have this
in her possession...

557
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:05,944
...when she entered
the Three Broomsticks?

558
00:53:06,581 --> 00:53:08,333
It's like I said.

559
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:13,244
She left to go to the loo, and when
she came back she had the package.

560
00:53:14,506 --> 00:53:17,211
She said it was important
that she deliver it.

561
00:53:18,051 --> 00:53:21,887
- Did she say to whom?
- To Professor Dumbledore.

562
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:24,556
Very well. Thank you, Leanne.
You may go.

563
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:34,773
Why is it when something happens
it is always you three?

564
00:53:35,858 --> 00:53:40,271
Believe me, professor, I've been asking
myself the same question for six years.

565
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:42,399
McGONAGALL:
Oh, Severus.

566
00:53:48,121 --> 00:53:49,993
What do you think?

567
00:53:51,915 --> 00:53:56,879
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be alive.

568
00:53:56,879 --> 00:53:59,298
She was cursed, wasn't she?

569
00:53:59,298 --> 00:54:01,968
I know Katie. Off the pitch,
she wouldn't hurt a fly.

570
00:54:02,468 --> 00:54:06,221
If she was delivering that to Dumbledore,
she wasn't doing it knowingly.

571
00:54:06,221 --> 00:54:08,130
Yes, she was cursed.

572
00:54:08,932 --> 00:54:10,592
It was Malfoy.

573
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:16,481
That is a very serious accusation, Potter.

574
00:54:16,481 --> 00:54:17,974
Indeed.

575
00:54:18,816 --> 00:54:22,232
- Your evidence?
- I just know.

576
00:54:22,987 --> 00:54:24,979
You just...

577
00:54:26,198 --> 00:54:27,609
...know.

578
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:32,745
You astonish with your gifts, Potter.

579
00:54:32,745 --> 00:54:36,875
Gifts mere mortals
can only dream of possessing.

580
00:54:36,875 --> 00:54:42,995
How grand it must be
to be the Chosen One.

581
00:54:47,676 --> 00:54:51,175
I suggest you go back to your dormitories.
All of you.

582
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:04,606
What do you suppose
Dean sees in her? Ginny?

583
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:08,487
Well, what does she see in him?

584
00:55:08,487 --> 00:55:10,866
Dean? He's brilliant.

585
00:55:10,866 --> 00:55:13,869
You called him a slick git
not five hours ago.

586
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:17,830
Yeah, well, he was running his hands
all over my sister, wasn't he?

587
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:22,373
Something snaps, and you've gotta
hate him, you know? On principle.

588
00:55:23,044 --> 00:55:24,538
I suppose.

589
00:55:25,796 --> 00:55:28,963
- So, what is it he sees in her?
- I don't know.

590
00:55:29,716 --> 00:55:32,124
She's smart, funny.

591
00:55:32,886 --> 00:55:35,175
- Attractive.
- Attractive?

592
00:55:36,723 --> 00:55:40,222
- You know, she's got nice skin.
- Skin?

593
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,063
Dean dates my sister
because of her skin?

594
00:55:43,063 --> 00:55:47,558
Well, no, I mean, I'm just saying
it could be a contributing factor.

595
00:55:50,944 --> 00:55:52,688
Hermione's got nice skin.

596
00:55:53,405 --> 00:55:56,157
Wouldn't you say? As skin goes, I mean.

597
00:55:57,117 --> 00:55:59,192
I've never really thought about it.

598
00:56:00,745 --> 00:56:02,453
But, I suppose, yeah.

599
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:04,664
Very nice.

600
00:56:09,087 --> 00:56:12,454
- I think I'll be going to sleep now.
- Right. Yeah.

601
00:56:22,307 --> 00:56:26,435
So tell me, Cormac, do you see anything
of your Uncle Tiberius these days?

602
00:56:26,435 --> 00:56:29,105
Yes, sir. In fact,
I'm meant to go hunting with him...

603
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:31,483
...and the Minister for Magic
over the holidays.

604
00:56:31,483 --> 00:56:34,611
Well, be sure to give them both my best.

605
00:56:34,611 --> 00:56:36,780
What about your uncle, Belby?

606
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:40,408
For those who don't know, Marcus'
uncle invented the Wolfsbane Potion.

607
00:56:40,408 --> 00:56:43,369
- Is he working on anything new?
- Don't know.

608
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:47,623
Him and Dad don't get on. Probably
because me dad says potions are rubbish.

609
00:56:47,623 --> 00:56:51,085
Says the only potion worth having
is a stiff one at the end of the day.

610
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:56,209
What about you, Miss Granger? What does
your family do in the Muggle world?

611
00:56:56,965 --> 00:56:58,791
My parents are dentists.

612
00:57:03,346 --> 00:57:04,806
They tend to people's teeth.

613
00:57:04,806 --> 00:57:09,726
Fascinating. And is that considered
a dangerous profession?

614
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,007
No.

615
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:17,651
Although, one boy, Robbie Fenwick,
did bite my father once.

616
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:18,896
He needed 10 stitches.

617
00:57:25,157 --> 00:57:28,776
Ah. Miss Weasley. Come in, come in.

618
00:57:31,497 --> 00:57:36,085
Look at her eyes.
They've been fighting again, her and Dean.

619
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,789
Sorry. I'm not usually late.

620
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:47,004
No matter. You're just in time for dessert,
that is, if Belby's left you any.

621
00:57:54,936 --> 00:57:56,187
What?

622
00:57:56,187 --> 00:57:57,812
Nothing.

623
00:58:04,154 --> 00:58:07,771
Goodbye. Bye-bye.

624
00:58:12,661 --> 00:58:14,580
- Potter.
- I'm sorry, sir.

625
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,153
I was just admiring your hourglass.

626
00:58:18,542 --> 00:58:20,001
Oh, yes.

627
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:22,582
A most intriguing object.

628
00:58:23,254 --> 00:58:27,800
The sand runs in accordance
with the quality of the conversation.

629
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:31,050
If it is stimulating, the sand runs slowly.

630
00:58:31,554 --> 00:58:33,639
- If it is not...
- I think I'll be going.

631
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:37,142
Nonsense.
You have nothing to fear, dear boy.

632
00:58:37,142 --> 00:58:39,561
As to some of your classmates...

633
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:43,148
...well, let's just say they're unlikely
to make the shelf.

634
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:44,642
The shelf, sir?

635
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:49,029
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here.

636
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:52,895
But then again, you already are someone,
aren't you, Harry?

637
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:56,407
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf, sir?

638
00:58:58,579 --> 00:59:02,494
You knew him, didn't you, sir,
Tom Riddle? You were his teacher.

639
00:59:03,585 --> 00:59:07,254
Mr. Riddle had a number of teachers
whilst here at Hogwarts.

640
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:08,832
What was he like?

641
00:59:12,551 --> 00:59:14,923
I'm sorry, sir. Forgive me.

642
00:59:15,596 --> 00:59:17,423
He killed my parents.

643
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:21,851
Of course.

644
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:24,852
It's only natural
you should want to know more.

645
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,775
But I'm afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry.

646
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,111
When I first met Mr. Riddle,
he was a quiet...

647
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:37,532
...albeit brilliant, boy committed
to becoming a first-rate wizard.

648
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:39,276
Not unlike others I've known.

649
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,944
Not unlike yourself, in fact.

650
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,364
If the monster existed...

651
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,157
...it was buried deep within.

652
01:00:05,475 --> 01:00:06,969
Good luck, eh, Ron.

653
01:00:08,394 --> 01:00:11,022
- Nice hat!
- Ron, you're a loser.

654
01:00:11,022 --> 01:00:14,275
I'm counting on you, Ron.
I have two Galleons on Gryffindor, yeah?

655
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:16,600
- Looking good, Ron.
- Loser!

656
01:00:18,822 --> 01:00:20,316
What's he wearing?

657
01:00:28,957 --> 01:00:30,782
So how was it, then?

658
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,503
- How was what?
- Your dinner party?

659
01:00:34,503 --> 01:00:36,127
Pretty boring, actually.

660
01:00:36,922 --> 01:00:39,247
Though I think Harry enjoyed dessert.

661
01:00:42,678 --> 01:00:45,596
Slughorn's having a Christmas do,
you know.

662
01:00:45,596 --> 01:00:47,306
And we're meant to bring someone.

663
01:00:47,306 --> 01:00:51,185
I expect you'll be bringing McLaggen.
He's in the Slug Club, isn't he?

664
01:00:51,185 --> 01:00:54,020
- Actually, I was going to ask you.
- Really?

665
01:00:56,857 --> 01:00:58,849
Good luck today, Ron.

666
01:00:59,693 --> 01:01:02,018
I know you'll be brilliant.

667
01:01:05,073 --> 01:01:08,994
I'm resigning. After today's match,
McLaggen can have my spot.

668
01:01:08,994 --> 01:01:10,662
Have it your way.

669
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:13,330
- Juice?
- Sure.

670
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,038
Hello, everyone.

671
01:01:16,291 --> 01:01:18,544
You look dreadful, Ron.

672
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:20,916
Is that why you put something
in his cup?

673
01:01:23,132 --> 01:01:24,756
Is it a tonic?

674
01:01:28,219 --> 01:01:29,844
Liquid luck.

675
01:01:31,222 --> 01:01:32,882
Don't drink it, Ron.

676
01:01:40,482 --> 01:01:43,850
- You could be expelled for that.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

677
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,692
Come on, Harry.
We've got a game to win.

678
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:17,682
Go on, Ron! Do it!

679
01:02:51,633 --> 01:02:53,920
<I>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</I>

680
01:02:55,928 --> 01:02:59,379
<I>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</I>

681
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:14,732
<I>Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!</I>

682
01:03:18,991 --> 01:03:20,868
You really shouldn't have done it.

683
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:25,862
I know. I suppose I could've
just used a Confundus Charm.

684
01:03:26,873 --> 01:03:31,500
That was different. That was tryouts.
This was an actual game.

685
01:03:34,297 --> 01:03:36,004
You didn't put it in.

686
01:03:37,716 --> 01:03:39,543
Ron only thought you did.

687
01:04:27,347 --> 01:04:30,633
Charms spell. I'm just practicing.

688
01:04:34,562 --> 01:04:36,388
Well, they're really good.

689
01:04:41,902 --> 01:04:43,895
How does it feel, Harry?

690
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:49,943
When you see Dean with Ginny?

691
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,498
I know.

692
01:04:57,583 --> 01:04:59,742
I see the way you look at her.

693
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:02,085
You're my best friend.

694
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:13,006
Oops.

695
01:05:14,433 --> 01:05:16,673
I think this room's taken.

696
01:05:18,436 --> 01:05:19,846
What's with the birds?

697
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:24,941
<I>Oppugno.</I>

698
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:54,677
It feels like this.

699
01:06:34,382 --> 01:06:37,594
Look, I can't help it
if she's got her knickers in a twist.

700
01:06:37,594 --> 01:06:42,849
What Lav and I have, well,
let's just say, there's no stopping it.

701
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:44,434
It's chemical.

702
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:48,939
Will it last? Who knows?
Point is, I'm a free agent.

703
01:06:48,939 --> 01:06:51,942
He's at perfect liberty
to kiss whoever he likes.

704
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:54,527
I really couldn't care less.

705
01:06:54,527 --> 01:06:58,530
Was I under the impression he and I would
be attending Slughorn's Christmas party?

706
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:00,199
Yes.

707
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:04,787
Now, given the circumstances,
I've had to make other arrangements.

708
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,163
Have you?

709
01:07:06,163 --> 01:07:08,332
Yes. Why?

710
01:07:08,332 --> 01:07:12,126
I just thought, seeing as neither of us
can go with who we'd really like to...

711
01:07:12,126 --> 01:07:14,545
...we should go together, as friends.

712
01:07:14,545 --> 01:07:16,339
Why didn't I think of that?

713
01:07:16,339 --> 01:07:18,049
Who are you going with?

714
01:07:18,049 --> 01:07:20,009
Um, it's a surprise.

715
01:07:20,009 --> 01:07:24,221
Anyway, it's you we've got to worry
about. You can't just take anyone.

716
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:26,720
See that girl over there?

717
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:33,230
That's Romilda Vane. Apparently she's
trying to smuggle you a love potion.

718
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:34,724
Really?

719
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:39,318
Hey! She's only interested in you because
she thinks you're the Chosen One.

720
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:41,195
But I am the Chosen One.

721
01:07:41,195 --> 01:07:44,066
Okay, sorry. Um, kidding.

722
01:07:46,075 --> 01:07:47,534
I'll ask someone I like.

723
01:07:48,327 --> 01:07:49,869
Someone cool.

724
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:02,842
I've never been to this part of the castle.

725
01:08:02,842 --> 01:08:06,262
At least not while awake.
I sleepwalk, you see.

726
01:08:06,262 --> 01:08:08,752
That's why I wear shoes to bed.

727
01:08:39,959 --> 01:08:42,960
<I>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</I>

728
01:08:55,473 --> 01:08:58,225
<I>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</I>

729
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:02,439
<I>Harmonia Nectere Passus.</I>

730
01:09:17,078 --> 01:09:18,489
Drink?

731
01:09:19,414 --> 01:09:20,914
Neville.

732
01:09:20,914 --> 01:09:22,541
I didn't get into the Slug Club.

733
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:25,836
It's okay, though. He's got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.

734
01:09:25,836 --> 01:09:28,623
- Oh, well, I'm fine, mate. Thanks.
- Okay.

735
01:09:39,056 --> 01:09:42,185
Hermione. What are you doing?
And what happened to you?

736
01:09:42,185 --> 01:09:47,648
I've just escaped.
I mean, left Cormac under the mistletoe.

737
01:09:47,648 --> 01:09:50,859
Cormac? That's who you invited?

738
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:53,350
I thought it would annoy Ron the most.

739
01:09:54,196 --> 01:09:56,364
Thank you. I'll catch up with you later.

740
01:09:56,364 --> 01:09:59,534
He's got more tentacles
than a Snarfalump plant.

741
01:09:59,534 --> 01:10:01,870
- Dragon tartare?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

742
01:10:01,870 --> 01:10:04,705
Just as well.
They give one horribly bad breath.

743
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:06,707
On second thoughts...

744
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:09,043
Might keep Cormac at bay.

745
01:10:09,043 --> 01:10:11,960
Oh, God, here he comes.

746
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:17,550
I think she just went to powder her nose.

747
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:19,802
Slippery little minx, your friend.

748
01:10:19,802 --> 01:10:22,507
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesn't she?

749
01:10:25,558 --> 01:10:27,551
What is this I'm eating, by the way?

750
01:10:28,729 --> 01:10:30,354
Dragon balls.

751
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:44,869
You've just bought yourself
a month's detention, McLaggen.

752
01:10:44,869 --> 01:10:48,735
Not so quick, Potter.

753
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:53,585
Sir, I really think I should
rejoin the party. My date...

754
01:10:53,585 --> 01:10:57,673
Can surely survive your absence
for another minute or two.

755
01:10:57,673 --> 01:10:59,913
Besides, I only wish
to convey a message.

756
01:11:00,549 --> 01:11:02,968
- A message?
- From Professor Dumbledore.

757
01:11:02,968 --> 01:11:06,806
He asked me to give you his best,
and he hopes you enjoy your holiday.

758
01:11:06,806 --> 01:11:08,516
You see...

759
01:11:08,516 --> 01:11:14,229
...he's traveling, and he won't
return until term resumes.

760
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:15,771
Traveling where?

761
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,779
Take your hands off me, you filthy Squib!

762
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,784
Professor Slughorn, sir.

763
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:33,288
I just discovered this boy
lurking in an upstairs corridor.

764
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:35,499
He claims to have been
invited to your party.

765
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:39,148
Okay, okay. I was gatecrashing. Happy?

766
01:11:39,148 --> 01:11:42,980
I'll escort him out.

767
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:49,446
Certainly, professor.

768
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,330
All right, everyone, carry on, carry on.

769
01:11:58,419 --> 01:12:03,507
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didn't. What's it to you?

770
01:12:03,507 --> 01:12:05,759
I swore to protect you.

771
01:12:05,759 --> 01:12:09,263
I made the Unbreakable Vow.

772
01:12:09,263 --> 01:12:11,598
I don't need protection.

773
01:12:11,598 --> 01:12:15,762
I was chosen for this.
Out of all others. Me.

774
01:12:16,687 --> 01:12:20,222
- And I won't fail him.
- You're afraid, Draco.

775
01:12:20,816 --> 01:12:24,903
You attempt to conceal it,
but it's obvious. Let me assist you.

776
01:12:24,903 --> 01:12:26,697
No!

777
01:12:26,697 --> 01:12:30,113
I was chosen. This is my moment.

778
01:12:42,546 --> 01:12:44,298
"Unbreakable Vow. "

779
01:12:44,298 --> 01:12:46,091
You're sure that's what Snape said?

780
01:12:46,091 --> 01:12:48,552
Positive. Why?

781
01:12:48,552 --> 01:12:52,222
Well, it's just you can't break
an Unbreakable Vow.

782
01:12:52,222 --> 01:12:55,556
I'd worked that much out for myself,
funnily enough.

783
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,803
You don't understand.

784
01:12:58,437 --> 01:12:59,468
Oh, bloody hell.

785
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,257
I miss you.

786
01:13:30,971 --> 01:13:32,681
Lovely.

787
01:13:32,681 --> 01:13:36,142
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped. Look.

788
01:13:36,142 --> 01:13:38,349
I'll take your word for it.

789
01:13:48,446 --> 01:13:53,404
So, what happens to you? What happens
if you break an Unbreakable Vow?

790
01:13:53,952 --> 01:13:55,660
You die.

791
01:14:00,250 --> 01:14:02,124
Wait, the pudding's still here.

792
01:14:03,378 --> 01:14:06,881
Voldemort has chosen
Draco Malfoy for a mission?

793
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:08,133
I know it sounds mad.

794
01:14:08,133 --> 01:14:11,803
Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

795
01:14:11,803 --> 01:14:14,472
...so he could find out
what he was up to?

796
01:14:14,472 --> 01:14:17,473
- That's not what it sounded like.
- Perhaps Harry's right.

797
01:14:18,018 --> 01:14:19,812
To make an Unbreakable Vow, it's...

798
01:14:19,812 --> 01:14:23,482
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledore's judgment.

799
01:14:23,482 --> 01:14:27,737
- Dumbledore trusts Snape, therefore I do.
- Dumbledore can make mistakes.

800
01:14:27,737 --> 01:14:29,071
You're blinded by hatred.

801
01:14:29,071 --> 01:14:31,111
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

802
01:14:32,867 --> 01:14:36,037
People are disappearing, Harry, daily.

803
01:14:36,037 --> 01:14:38,164
We place our trust
in a handful of people.

804
01:14:38,164 --> 01:14:41,118
If we start fighting amongst ourselves,
we're doomed.

805
01:15:05,608 --> 01:15:07,150
Open up, you.

806
01:15:08,819 --> 01:15:10,444
Don't you trust me?

807
01:15:16,702 --> 01:15:17,781
It's good.

808
01:15:18,704 --> 01:15:21,539
Yeah, I'll just... Get... Yeah.

809
01:15:28,297 --> 01:15:31,084
- Pie?
- Not for me, no.

810
01:15:43,021 --> 01:15:44,815
You'll have to forgive Remus.

811
01:15:44,815 --> 01:15:47,650
It takes its toll, his condition.

812
01:15:48,568 --> 01:15:50,779
Are you all right, Mr. Weasley?

813
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:53,490
We're being followed, all of us.

814
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:55,981
Most days,
Molly doesn't leave the house.

815
01:15:56,827 --> 01:15:58,903
It's not been easy.

816
01:16:00,914 --> 01:16:02,499
Did you get my owl?

817
01:16:02,499 --> 01:16:04,575
Yes, I did.

818
01:16:06,086 --> 01:16:09,298
If Dumbledore's traveling,
then that's news to the Ministry...

819
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,753
...but perhaps that's the way
Dumbledore wants it.

820
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,958
As for Draco Malfoy...

821
01:16:15,595 --> 01:16:16,758
...I know a bit more.

822
01:16:17,389 --> 01:16:20,600
- Go on.
- I sent an agent to Borgin and Burkes.

823
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,103
I think, from what you described...

824
01:16:23,103 --> 01:16:24,938
...what you and Ron saw in summer...

825
01:16:24,938 --> 01:16:28,609
...the object
that Draco is so interested in...

826
01:16:28,609 --> 01:16:30,103
...is a vanishing cabinet.

827
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:32,446
A vanishing cabinet?

828
01:16:32,446 --> 01:16:36,617
They were all the rage
when Voldemort first rose to power.

829
01:16:36,617 --> 01:16:39,745
You can see the appeal.
Should Death Eaters come knocking...

830
01:16:39,745 --> 01:16:44,490
...one simply had to slip inside
and disappear for an hour or two.

831
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:47,044
They can transport you anywhere.

832
01:16:47,044 --> 01:16:50,589
Tricky contraptions though,
very temperamental.

833
01:16:50,589 --> 01:16:53,676
What happened to it?
The one at Borgin and Burkes?

834
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:54,791
Nothing.

835
01:16:55,637 --> 01:16:57,344
It's still there.

836
01:17:08,441 --> 01:17:10,318
It was delicious, Molly, really.

837
01:17:10,318 --> 01:17:11,819
Are you sure you won't stay?

838
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:16,366
No, we should go. The first night
of the cycle's always the worst.

839
01:17:16,366 --> 01:17:17,397
Remus?

840
01:17:26,334 --> 01:17:27,876
Sweetheart.

841
01:17:36,177 --> 01:17:38,096
Has Ron gone to bed?

842
01:17:38,096 --> 01:17:40,931
Um... Not yet. No.

843
01:17:42,725 --> 01:17:44,054
Shoelace.

844
01:17:56,656 --> 01:17:58,530
Merry Christmas, Harry.

845
01:17:59,951 --> 01:18:01,493
Merry Christmas.

846
01:18:18,762 --> 01:18:21,051
- Harry, no!
- Remus!

847
01:18:30,899 --> 01:18:32,310
Ginny!

848
01:18:35,487 --> 01:18:40,326
<I>I killed Sirius Black!</I>
<I>I killed Sirius Black!</I>

849
01:18:40,326 --> 01:18:42,567
You coming to get me?

850
01:18:43,662 --> 01:18:46,996
Harry, can you get me?
You coming to get me?

851
01:19:16,737 --> 01:19:18,112
Harry?

852
01:19:35,632 --> 01:19:37,292
<I>Stupefy!</I>

853
01:20:00,156 --> 01:20:01,900
Harry!

854
01:20:15,422 --> 01:20:16,620
Ginny!

855
01:20:46,203 --> 01:20:47,698
Molly.

856
01:21:10,686 --> 01:21:12,563
It's easy for them to get to you.

857
01:21:12,563 --> 01:21:16,859
You're bloody lucky you weren't killed.
You have to realize who you are, Harry.

858
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:19,397
I know who I am, Hermione, all right?

859
01:21:20,363 --> 01:21:21,561
Sorry.

860
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,744
Lav, come on. Of course I'll wear it.

861
01:21:26,744 --> 01:21:28,902
That's my Won-Won.

862
01:21:30,915 --> 01:21:33,322
Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.

863
01:21:50,977 --> 01:21:53,437
<I>I'd like to know</I>
<I>where you get your information.</I>

864
01:21:53,437 --> 01:21:56,474
<I>More knowledgeable</I>
<I>than half the staff, you are.</I>

865
01:22:02,114 --> 01:22:04,116
Sir...

866
01:22:04,116 --> 01:22:07,119
...is it true
that Professor Merrythought is retiring?

867
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:10,163
Now, Tom.
I couldn't tell you if I knew, could I?

868
01:22:10,163 --> 01:22:14,327
By the way, thank you for the pineapple.
You're quite right, it is my favorite.

869
01:22:14,918 --> 01:22:17,207
But how did you know?

870
01:22:19,047 --> 01:22:20,625
Intuition.

871
01:22:24,803 --> 01:22:26,680
Gracious. Is it that time already?

872
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:30,345
Off you go, boys, or Professor Dippet
will have us all in detention.

873
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:38,311
Look sharp, Tom. Don't want to be caught
out of bed after hours.

874
01:22:40,235 --> 01:22:42,311
- Is something on your mind, Tom?
- Yes, sir.

875
01:22:43,655 --> 01:22:46,490
You see, I couldn't think
of anyone else to go to.

876
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:52,789
The other professors,
well, they're not like you.

877
01:22:52,789 --> 01:22:56,001
They might misunderstand.

878
01:22:56,001 --> 01:22:57,579
Go on.

879
01:22:58,378 --> 01:23:00,667
I was in the library the other night...

880
01:23:01,214 --> 01:23:03,421
...in the Restricted Section...

881
01:23:04,176 --> 01:23:07,711
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

882
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:12,309
And I thought perhaps
you could illuminate me.

883
01:23:12,309 --> 01:23:15,097
It's called, as I understand it...

884
01:23:18,024 --> 01:23:19,359
I beg your pardon?

885
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:23,112
I don't know anything about such things,
and if I did, I wouldn't tell you!

886
01:23:23,112 --> 01:23:27,905
Now, get out of here at once, and don't
let me ever catch you mentioning it again!

887
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:32,033
Confused?

888
01:23:32,705 --> 01:23:34,199
I'd be surprised if you weren't.

889
01:23:35,124 --> 01:23:38,044
Well, I don't understand.
What happened?

890
01:23:38,044 --> 01:23:42,048
This is perhaps the most important
memory I've collected.

891
01:23:42,048 --> 01:23:43,791
It is also a lie.

892
01:23:44,717 --> 01:23:46,678
This memory has been tampered with...

893
01:23:46,678 --> 01:23:51,055
...by the same person whose memory it is,
our old friend, Professor Slughorn.

894
01:23:51,683 --> 01:23:53,851
But why would he tamper
with his own memory?

895
01:23:53,851 --> 01:23:56,896
- I suspect he's ashamed of it.
- Why?

896
01:23:56,896 --> 01:23:58,390
Why, indeed?

897
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:02,735
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn, and you have done so.

898
01:24:02,735 --> 01:24:06,531
Now I want you to persuade him
to divulge his true memory...

899
01:24:06,531 --> 01:24:08,241
...any way you can.

900
01:24:08,241 --> 01:24:10,198
I don't know him that well, sir.

901
01:24:14,664 --> 01:24:17,581
This memory is everything.

902
01:24:18,084 --> 01:24:20,077
Without it, we are blind.

903
01:24:20,586 --> 01:24:24,205
Without it, we leave the fate
of our world to chance.

904
01:24:26,259 --> 01:24:28,086
You have no choice.

905
01:24:29,304 --> 01:24:31,297
You must not fail.

906
01:24:39,398 --> 01:24:41,900
So I'd highly recommend
you reacquaint yourself...

907
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:43,527
...with the chapter on antidotes.

908
01:24:43,527 --> 01:24:47,448
I'll tell you more about bezoars
in our next class. Right, off you go.

909
01:24:47,448 --> 01:24:49,939
Alys, don't forget your rat tail.

910
01:24:55,414 --> 01:24:59,376
Aha. If it isn't
the Prince of Potions himself.

911
01:24:59,376 --> 01:25:01,285
To what do I owe this pleasure?

912
01:25:02,463 --> 01:25:04,715
Sir, I wondered
if I might ask you something.

913
01:25:04,715 --> 01:25:07,134
Ask away, dear boy, ask away.

914
01:25:07,134 --> 01:25:10,304
The other day I was in the library,
in the Restricted Section...

915
01:25:10,304 --> 01:25:13,969
...and I came across something rather odd
about a very rare piece of magic.

916
01:25:15,309 --> 01:25:18,145
Yes. And what was this
rare piece of magic?

917
01:25:18,145 --> 01:25:21,649
Well, I don't know.
I can't remember the name exactly.

918
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:25,978
It got me wondering, are there some kinds
of magic you're not allowed to teach us?

919
01:25:27,988 --> 01:25:29,490
I'm Potions Master, Harry.

920
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:32,493
I think your question'd
better be posed to Professor Snape.

921
01:25:32,493 --> 01:25:34,578
Yes. Um...

922
01:25:34,578 --> 01:25:37,247
He and I don't exactly
see eye to eye, sir.

923
01:25:37,247 --> 01:25:39,039
What I mean to say is...

924
01:25:39,875 --> 01:25:41,666
...well, he's not like you.

925
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:44,163
He might misunderstand.

926
01:25:45,464 --> 01:25:49,469
Yes. There can be no light
without the dark.

927
01:25:49,469 --> 01:25:53,514
And so it is with magic. Myself, I always
strive to live within the light.

928
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:56,184
I suggest you do the same.

929
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:59,185
Is that what you told Tom Riddle,
when he came asking questions?

930
01:26:06,152 --> 01:26:09,189
Dumbledore put you up to this,
didn't he?

931
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,824
Didn't he?

932
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,876
Yes?

933
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:24,170
Oh, it's you, Potter.

934
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,543
I'm sorry, I'm busy at the moment.

935
01:26:39,352 --> 01:26:43,136
It's beautiful, isn't it? The moon.

936
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:45,559
Divine.

937
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:48,523
Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?

938
01:26:49,654 --> 01:26:53,408
It was on your bed, the box.
I just thought I'd try one.

939
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:57,078
- Or 20.
- I can't stop thinking about her, Harry.

940
01:26:57,078 --> 01:26:59,247
Honestly, I reckoned
she was annoying you.

941
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:01,572
She could never annoy me.

942
01:27:03,377 --> 01:27:04,919
I think I love her.

943
01:27:08,507 --> 01:27:10,796
Well, brilliant.

944
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:16,432
Do you think she knows I exist?

945
01:27:16,432 --> 01:27:19,101
I hope so. She's been snogging you
for three months.

946
01:27:19,101 --> 01:27:22,055
Snogging? Who are you talking about?

947
01:27:22,980 --> 01:27:24,225
Who are you talking about?

948
01:27:24,982 --> 01:27:28,778
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.

949
01:27:28,778 --> 01:27:30,272
Okay, very funny.

950
01:27:33,407 --> 01:27:37,244
- What was that for?
- It's no joke! I'm in love with her!

951
01:27:37,244 --> 01:27:40,115
Fine, you're in love with her.
Have you ever actually met her?

952
01:27:41,082 --> 01:27:44,036
No. Can you introduce me?

953
01:28:05,731 --> 01:28:10,477
Come on, Ron. I'm gonna introduce you
to Romilda Vane.

954
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:24,948
I'm sorry, sir. I wouldn't bother you
if it weren't absolutely essential.

955
01:28:25,794 --> 01:28:27,379
Where's Romilda?

956
01:28:27,379 --> 01:28:29,336
What's the matter with Wenby?

957
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:31,842
Very powerful love potion.

958
01:28:31,842 --> 01:28:34,386
Very well. Better bring him in.

959
01:28:34,386 --> 01:28:37,848
I'd have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time, Harry.

960
01:28:37,848 --> 01:28:40,934
Well, I thought this called
for a more practiced hand, sir.

961
01:28:40,934 --> 01:28:44,187
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?

962
01:28:44,187 --> 01:28:45,847
Perhaps you're right.

963
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:55,949
I'm sorry, by the way, professor,
about earlier today, our misunderstanding.

964
01:28:55,949 --> 01:29:00,495
Oh, not at all. All water
under the bridge, you know? Correct?

965
01:29:00,495 --> 01:29:03,582
I expect you're tired of it
after all these years.

966
01:29:03,582 --> 01:29:06,335
All the questions about Voldemort.

967
01:29:06,335 --> 01:29:08,161
Don't use that name.

968
01:29:15,886 --> 01:29:18,138
There you are, old boy. Bottoms up.

969
01:29:18,138 --> 01:29:21,258
- What's this?
- Tonic for the nerves.

970
01:29:35,781 --> 01:29:38,242
- What happened to me?
- Love potion.

971
01:29:38,242 --> 01:29:40,365
A bloody strong one at that.

972
01:29:40,954 --> 01:29:44,749
- I feel really bad.
- You need a pick-me-up.

973
01:29:44,749 --> 01:29:48,586
Got Butterbeer,
wine, dazzling oak-matured mead.

974
01:29:48,586 --> 01:29:52,915
I had other intentions for this,
but I think, given the circumstances...

975
01:29:55,218 --> 01:29:57,095
Here we are, Potter.

976
01:29:57,095 --> 01:29:58,589
To life!

977
01:30:03,393 --> 01:30:04,424
Ron.

978
01:30:06,896 --> 01:30:10,347
Ron. Professor, do something.

979
01:30:11,442 --> 01:30:13,067
I don't understand.

980
01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,252
Come on, Ron, breathe.

981
01:30:53,485 --> 01:30:56,320
These girls, they're gonna kill me.

982
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:10,878
Quick thinking on your part, Harry,
using a bezoar.

983
01:31:10,878 --> 01:31:13,422
You must be very proud
of your student, Horace.

984
01:31:13,422 --> 01:31:17,009
Hm? Oh, yes, very proud.

985
01:31:17,009 --> 01:31:19,928
I think we agree,
Potter's actions were heroic.

986
01:31:19,928 --> 01:31:24,099
The question is,
why were they necessary?

987
01:31:24,099 --> 01:31:26,018
Why, indeed?

988
01:31:26,018 --> 01:31:28,354
This appears to be a gift, Horace.

989
01:31:28,354 --> 01:31:31,357
You don't remember
who gave you this bottle?

990
01:31:31,357 --> 01:31:35,486
Which, by the way, possesses remarkably
subtle hints of licorice and cherry...

991
01:31:35,486 --> 01:31:38,113
...when not polluted with poison.

992
01:31:38,113 --> 01:31:41,408
Actually I had intended
to give it as a gift myself.

993
01:31:41,408 --> 01:31:42,784
To whom, I might ask?

994
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:46,778
To you, Headmaster.

995
01:31:49,124 --> 01:31:50,376
Where is he?

996
01:31:50,376 --> 01:31:54,504
Where's my Won-Won?
Has he been asking for me?

997
01:31:57,549 --> 01:31:59,385
What's she doing here?

998
01:31:59,385 --> 01:32:01,804
I might ask you the same question.

999
01:32:01,804 --> 01:32:04,223
I happen to be his girlfriend.

1000
01:32:04,223 --> 01:32:07,142
I happen to be his friend.

1001
01:32:07,142 --> 01:32:11,355
Don't make me laugh.
You haven't spoken in weeks.

1002
01:32:12,148 --> 01:32:15,193
I suppose you want to make up
now that he's all interesting.

1003
01:32:15,193 --> 01:32:19,072
He's been poisoned, you daft dimbo!

1004
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:21,907
And for the record,
I've always found him interesting.

1005
01:32:23,576 --> 01:32:28,790
Ah. See? He senses my presence.

1006
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:32,076
Don't worry, Won-Won. I'm here.

1007
01:32:32,752 --> 01:32:34,579
I'm here.

1008
01:32:40,427 --> 01:32:43,630
Uh... Hermione...

1009
01:32:47,684 --> 01:32:49,677
Hermione.

1010
01:32:50,437 --> 01:32:52,678
Hermione.

1011
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:04,534
Oh, to be young,
and to feel love's keen sting.

1012
01:33:04,534 --> 01:33:07,037
Well, come away, everybody.

1013
01:33:07,037 --> 01:33:09,658
Mr. Weasley is well tended.

1014
01:33:13,918 --> 01:33:16,456
About time, don't you think?

1015
01:33:19,132 --> 01:33:20,710
Thank you.

1016
01:33:23,637 --> 01:33:25,464
Oh, shut up.

1017
01:35:37,773 --> 01:35:41,557
Stop it, Ron. You're making it snow.

1018
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:48,700
Tell me how I broke up
with Lavender again.

1019
01:35:49,534 --> 01:35:52,537
Um, well...

1020
01:35:52,537 --> 01:35:55,538
...she came to visit you
in the hospital.

1021
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,825
And you talked.

1022
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:04,676
I don't believe it was
a particularly long conversation.

1023
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:08,137
Don't get me wrong, I'm bloody thrilled
to be shot of her.

1024
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:10,463
It's just she seems a bit put out.

1025
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:20,479
Yes, she does, doesn't she?

1026
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:27,323
You say you don't remember
anything from that night?

1027
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:30,493
Anything at all?

1028
01:36:30,493 --> 01:36:32,320
There is something.

1029
01:36:35,832 --> 01:36:40,292
But it can't be.
I was completely boggled, wasn't I?

1030
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:44,999
Right. Boggled.

1031
01:36:52,265 --> 01:36:53,510
Harry.

1032
01:36:54,976 --> 01:36:56,138
That's Katie.

1033
01:36:58,104 --> 01:36:59,729
Katie Bell.

1034
01:37:07,405 --> 01:37:09,777
Katie. How are you?

1035
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:14,947
I know you're going to ask, Harry,
but I don't know who cursed me.

1036
01:37:16,582 --> 01:37:20,544
I've been trying to remember, honestly.

1037
01:37:20,544 --> 01:37:23,960
But I just can't.

1038
01:37:37,227 --> 01:37:38,556
Katie?

1039
01:38:21,021 --> 01:38:25,101
I know what you did, Malfoy.
You hexed her, didn't you?

1040
01:38:55,473 --> 01:38:57,466
<I>Sectumsempra!</I>

1041
01:39:44,439 --> 01:39:47,356
<I>Vulnera Sanentur.</I>

1042
01:39:49,028 --> 01:39:51,863
<I>Vulnera Sanentur.</I>

1043
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:57,029
<I>Vulnera Sanentur.</I>

1044
01:40:18,140 --> 01:40:21,675
You have to get rid of it. Today.

1045
01:40:26,565 --> 01:40:28,190
Take my hand.

1046
01:40:44,166 --> 01:40:46,076
The Room of Requirement.

1047
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:55,344
We need to hide
the Half-Blood Prince's book...

1048
01:40:55,344 --> 01:40:59,045
...where no one will ever find it,
including you.

1049
01:41:07,399 --> 01:41:08,858
- What was that?
- What was that?

1050
01:41:34,968 --> 01:41:36,297
See?

1051
01:41:36,845 --> 01:41:38,885
You never know what you'll find up here.

1052
01:41:58,033 --> 01:42:01,947
All right, close your eyes.
That way you can't be tempted.

1053
01:42:05,791 --> 01:42:07,499
Close your eyes.

1054
01:42:34,195 --> 01:42:37,066
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.

1055
01:42:51,713 --> 01:42:54,257
So did you and Ginny do it, then?

1056
01:42:54,257 --> 01:42:55,591
What?

1057
01:42:55,591 --> 01:42:57,844
You know, hide the book?

1058
01:42:57,844 --> 01:42:59,717
Oh, yeah.

1059
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:05,393
Ah. Dear, yes.

1060
01:43:05,393 --> 01:43:08,180
Still no luck with Slughorn, then,
I take it?

1061
01:43:10,231 --> 01:43:11,560
Luck.

1062
01:43:12,608 --> 01:43:15,942
That's it. All I need's a bit of luck.

1063
01:43:34,088 --> 01:43:37,468
Well, how do you feel?

1064
01:43:37,468 --> 01:43:39,092
Excellent.

1065
01:43:40,262 --> 01:43:42,255
Really excellent.

1066
01:43:45,017 --> 01:43:46,935
Remember...

1067
01:43:46,935 --> 01:43:48,854
...Slughorn usually eats early...

1068
01:43:48,854 --> 01:43:52,024
...takes a walk,
and then returns to his office.

1069
01:43:52,024 --> 01:43:53,942
Right.

1070
01:43:53,942 --> 01:43:56,278
- I'm going down to Hagrid's.
- What?

1071
01:43:56,278 --> 01:43:58,947
No, Harry, you've got to go
and speak to Slughorn.

1072
01:44:00,532 --> 01:44:03,285
- We have a plan.
- I know...

1073
01:44:03,285 --> 01:44:05,537
...but I've got a
good feeling about Hagrid's.

1074
01:44:05,537 --> 01:44:09,286
I feel it's the place to be tonight.
Do you know what I mean?

1075
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:12,586
- No.
- Well, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

1076
01:44:12,586 --> 01:44:14,745
Or Felix does.

1077
01:44:47,997 --> 01:44:49,873
Merlin's beard, Harry!

1078
01:44:49,873 --> 01:44:54,170
Sorry, sir. I should've announced myself.
Cleared my throat, coughed.

1079
01:44:54,170 --> 01:44:56,298
You probably feared
I was Professor Sprout.

1080
01:44:56,298 --> 01:44:59,884
Yes, I did, actually.
What makes you think that?

1081
01:44:59,884 --> 01:45:02,137
Well, just the general behavior, sir.

1082
01:45:02,137 --> 01:45:05,098
The sneaking around,
the jumping when you saw me.

1083
01:45:05,098 --> 01:45:08,852
Are those Tentacula leaves, sir?
They're very valuable, aren't they?

1084
01:45:08,852 --> 01:45:11,354
Ten Galleons a leaf to the right buyer.

1085
01:45:11,354 --> 01:45:15,025
Not that I'm familiar with any such
transactions, but one does hear rumors.

1086
01:45:15,025 --> 01:45:18,987
My own interests
are purely academic, of course.

1087
01:45:18,987 --> 01:45:22,272
Personally, these plants
always kind of freaked me out.

1088
01:45:25,535 --> 01:45:27,871
How did you get out of the castle, Harry?

1089
01:45:27,871 --> 01:45:29,539
Through the front door, sir.

1090
01:45:29,539 --> 01:45:31,875
I'm off to Hagrid's.
He's a very dear friend...

1091
01:45:31,875 --> 01:45:33,752
...and I fancied paying him a visit.

1092
01:45:33,752 --> 01:45:36,040
So if you don't mind,
I will be going now.

1093
01:45:36,838 --> 01:45:38,463
Harry!

1094
01:45:39,299 --> 01:45:41,926
- Sir?
- It's nearly nightfall.

1095
01:45:41,926 --> 01:45:45,555
Surely you realize I can't allow you
to go roaming the grounds by yourself.

1096
01:45:45,555 --> 01:45:48,129
Well, then, by all means, come along, sir.

1097
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,858
Harry, I must insist
you accompany me...

1098
01:45:56,858 --> 01:45:58,777
...back to the castle immediately!

1099
01:45:58,777 --> 01:46:02,027
That would be counterproductive, sir.

1100
01:46:03,365 --> 01:46:05,488
And what makes you say that?

1101
01:46:06,576 --> 01:46:08,154
No idea.

1102
01:46:14,919 --> 01:46:16,330
Horace.

1103
01:46:16,963 --> 01:46:22,253
Merlin's beard.
Is that an actual Acromantula?

1104
01:46:22,843 --> 01:46:24,919
A dead one, I think, sir.

1105
01:46:25,721 --> 01:46:27,263
Good God.

1106
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:31,268
Dear fellow,
however did you manage to kill it?

1107
01:46:31,268 --> 01:46:34,897
Kill it? Me oldest friend, he was.

1108
01:46:34,897 --> 01:46:39,109
- I'm so sorry, I didn't...
- Don't worry yourself, you're not alone.

1109
01:46:39,610 --> 01:46:43,239
Seriously misunderstood creatures,
spiders are.

1110
01:46:43,239 --> 01:46:45,866
It's the eyes, I reckon.
They unnerve some folk.

1111
01:46:45,866 --> 01:46:47,824
Not to mention the pincers.

1112
01:46:52,123 --> 01:46:54,080
Yeah, I reckon that too.

1113
01:46:54,792 --> 01:46:58,337
Hagrid, the last thing
I wish to be is indelicate...

1114
01:46:58,337 --> 01:47:02,591
...but Acromantular venom
is uncommonly rare.

1115
01:47:02,591 --> 01:47:04,969
Would you allow me
to extract a vial or two?

1116
01:47:04,969 --> 01:47:07,763
Purely for academic purposes,
you understand.

1117
01:47:07,763 --> 01:47:10,850
Well, I don't suppose it's going
to do him much good now, is it?

1118
01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:12,226
My thoughts exactly.

1119
01:47:12,226 --> 01:47:18,983
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

1120
01:47:18,983 --> 01:47:23,977
Old Potions Master's habit, you know.

1121
01:47:24,655 --> 01:47:27,284
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1122
01:47:27,284 --> 01:47:30,949
Magnificent, he was. Just magnificent.

1123
01:47:32,372 --> 01:47:33,950
Oh, dear.

1124
01:47:43,675 --> 01:47:47,137
- Would you like me to say a few words?
- Yes.

1125
01:47:47,137 --> 01:47:48,847
He had a family, I trust?

1126
01:47:48,847 --> 01:47:50,341
Oh, yeah.

1127
01:47:55,687 --> 01:47:57,356
Farewell...

1128
01:47:57,356 --> 01:47:59,229
Aragog.

1129
01:48:03,737 --> 01:48:07,032
Farewell, Aragog...

1130
01:48:07,032 --> 01:48:09,701
...king of the arachnids.

1131
01:48:10,535 --> 01:48:13,109
Your body will decay...

1132
01:48:14,373 --> 01:48:17,208
...but your spirit lingers on.

1133
01:48:17,918 --> 01:48:24,537
And your human friends find solace
in the loss they have sustained.

1134
01:48:39,731 --> 01:48:43,528
I had him from an egg, you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1135
01:48:43,528 --> 01:48:47,407
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese, mind you.

1136
01:48:47,407 --> 01:48:52,745
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1137
01:48:52,745 --> 01:48:58,084
One afternoon I came downstairs,
and he'd vanished.

1138
01:48:58,084 --> 01:48:59,836
Poof.

1139
01:48:59,836 --> 01:49:03,214
- That's very odd, isn't it?
- It is, isn't it?

1140
01:49:03,214 --> 01:49:07,093
But that's life, I suppose.

1141
01:49:07,093 --> 01:49:12,598
You go along and then suddenly, poof!

1142
01:49:12,598 --> 01:49:16,264
- Poof.
- Poof.

1143
01:49:30,825 --> 01:49:33,945
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1144
01:49:34,954 --> 01:49:39,248
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1145
01:49:40,168 --> 01:49:43,122
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1146
01:49:43,921 --> 01:49:47,456
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1147
01:49:49,010 --> 01:49:51,465
As I watched, it sank.

1148
01:49:52,972 --> 01:49:55,975
Just before it reached the bottom...

1149
01:49:55,975 --> 01:49:57,434
...it transformed...

1150
01:49:58,811 --> 01:50:00,639
...into a wee fish.

1151
01:50:02,316 --> 01:50:04,439
It was beautiful magic.

1152
01:50:05,444 --> 01:50:07,686
Wondrous to behold.

1153
01:50:10,324 --> 01:50:13,076
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1154
01:50:15,454 --> 01:50:16,485
Your mother.

1155
01:50:18,540 --> 01:50:21,031
The day I came downstairs...

1156
01:50:22,002 --> 01:50:24,291
...the day the bowl was empty...

1157
01:50:25,839 --> 01:50:27,998
...was the day your mother...

1158
01:50:32,012 --> 01:50:34,005
I know why you're here.

1159
01:50:37,017 --> 01:50:39,010
But I can't help you.

1160
01:50:40,813 --> 01:50:42,521
It would ruin me.

1161
01:50:46,235 --> 01:50:48,690
Do you know why I survived, professor?

1162
01:50:49,238 --> 01:50:51,065
The night I got this?

1163
01:50:52,825 --> 01:50:54,449
Because of her.

1164
01:50:55,369 --> 01:50:57,579
Because she sacrificed herself.

1165
01:50:57,579 --> 01:51:00,124
Because she refused to step aside.

1166
01:51:00,124 --> 01:51:03,502
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

1167
01:51:03,502 --> 01:51:07,203
- Don't say his name.
- I'm not afraid of the name, professor.

1168
01:51:08,048 --> 01:51:10,171
I'm going to tell you something.

1169
01:51:11,093 --> 01:51:14,047
Something others have only guessed at.

1170
01:51:16,015 --> 01:51:17,510
It's true.

1171
01:51:18,101 --> 01:51:19,381
I am the Chosen One.

1172
01:51:20,395 --> 01:51:22,772
Only I can destroy him,
but in order to do so...

1173
01:51:22,772 --> 01:51:26,234
...I need to know what Tom Riddle
asked you years ago in your office...

1174
01:51:26,234 --> 01:51:28,606
...and I need to know what you told him.

1175
01:51:29,321 --> 01:51:31,728
Be brave, professor.

1176
01:51:33,366 --> 01:51:35,442
Be brave like my mother.

1177
01:51:36,745 --> 01:51:39,414
Otherwise, you disgrace her.

1178
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:42,829
Otherwise, she died for nothing.

1179
01:51:43,835 --> 01:51:49,042
Otherwise, the bowl
will remain empty forever.

1180
01:51:59,601 --> 01:52:02,721
Please, don't think badly of me
when you see it.

1181
01:52:04,731 --> 01:52:08,017
You've no idea what he was like,
even then.

1182
01:52:44,772 --> 01:52:47,650
I was in the library the other night...

1183
01:52:47,650 --> 01:52:49,808
...in the Restricted Section...

1184
01:52:50,695 --> 01:52:54,313
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1185
01:52:55,616 --> 01:52:58,368
It's called, as I understand it...

1186
01:52:59,662 --> 01:53:00,990
...a Horcrux.

1187
01:53:02,832 --> 01:53:06,002
- I beg your pardon?
- Horcrux.

1188
01:53:06,002 --> 01:53:08,838
I came across the term while reading...

1189
01:53:08,838 --> 01:53:12,008
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1190
01:53:12,008 --> 01:53:13,926
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

1191
01:53:13,926 --> 01:53:16,679
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

1192
01:53:16,679 --> 01:53:18,221
Which is...

1193
01:53:19,348 --> 01:53:21,175
...why I came to you.

1194
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:29,817
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1195
01:53:29,817 --> 01:53:32,438
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

1196
01:53:35,031 --> 01:53:39,201
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1197
01:53:39,201 --> 01:53:42,997
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1198
01:53:42,997 --> 01:53:44,290
Protected?

1199
01:53:44,290 --> 01:53:47,493
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1200
01:53:48,961 --> 01:53:51,370
In other words, you cannot die.

1201
01:53:58,555 --> 01:54:01,892
And how does one split his soul, sir?

1202
01:54:01,892 --> 01:54:04,679
I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

1203
01:54:05,896 --> 01:54:07,390
Murder.

1204
01:54:07,898 --> 01:54:09,226
Yes.

1205
01:54:09,775 --> 01:54:14,686
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

1206
01:54:15,572 --> 01:54:20,494
Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

1207
01:54:20,494 --> 01:54:21,988
Seven?

1208
01:54:22,746 --> 01:54:28,210
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1209
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:31,958
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

1210
01:54:33,131 --> 01:54:36,168
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

1211
01:54:40,931 --> 01:54:42,259
Of course, sir.

1212
01:54:45,227 --> 01:54:47,219
It'll be our little secret.

1213
01:54:56,029 --> 01:54:57,274
Sir.

1214
01:55:12,672 --> 01:55:14,966
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1215
01:55:14,966 --> 01:55:17,802
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

1216
01:55:17,802 --> 01:55:21,097
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

1217
01:55:21,097 --> 01:55:22,307
What are they exactly?

1218
01:55:22,307 --> 01:55:25,640
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1219
01:55:28,813 --> 01:55:30,521
A ring, for example.

1220
01:55:31,149 --> 01:55:32,643
Or a book.

1221
01:55:33,943 --> 01:55:36,315
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

1222
01:55:36,821 --> 01:55:39,115
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

1223
01:55:39,115 --> 01:55:41,576
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

1224
01:55:41,576 --> 01:55:43,661
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1225
01:55:43,661 --> 01:55:48,833
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1226
01:55:48,833 --> 01:55:51,210
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

1227
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:56,132
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1228
01:55:56,132 --> 01:56:00,178
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

1229
01:56:00,178 --> 01:56:01,512
One destroys Voldemort.

1230
01:56:01,512 --> 01:56:04,599
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1231
01:56:04,599 --> 01:56:07,849
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

1232
01:56:21,824 --> 01:56:23,699
...leaves traces.

1233
01:56:31,502 --> 01:56:33,754
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

1234
01:56:33,754 --> 01:56:36,043
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

1235
01:56:36,882 --> 01:56:40,135
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1236
01:56:40,135 --> 01:56:44,215
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1237
01:56:45,766 --> 01:56:50,428
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

1238
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,860
Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1239
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:59,655
...that you take too much for granted?

1240
01:56:59,655 --> 01:57:04,868
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1241
01:57:04,868 --> 01:57:06,991
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1242
01:57:07,871 --> 01:57:13,661
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1243
01:57:32,062 --> 01:57:33,687
Oh, Harry.

1244
01:57:36,275 --> 01:57:38,601
You need a shave, my friend.

1245
01:57:41,406 --> 01:57:45,785
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

1246
01:57:45,785 --> 01:57:49,735
At times, I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1247
01:57:51,291 --> 01:57:54,127
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry.

1248
01:57:54,127 --> 01:57:55,795
I'm an old man.

1249
01:57:55,795 --> 01:57:57,455
You still look the same to me, sir.

1250
01:57:58,923 --> 01:58:02,093
Just like your mother,
you're unfailingly kind.

1251
01:58:02,093 --> 01:58:05,296
A trait people never fail to undervalue,
I'm afraid.

1252
01:58:08,058 --> 01:58:12,729
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1253
01:58:12,729 --> 01:58:16,399
I promised you could accompany me,
and I stand by that promise.

1254
01:58:16,399 --> 01:58:18,401
But there is one condition:

1255
01:58:18,401 --> 01:58:21,604
You must obey every command
I give you, without question.

1256
01:58:22,489 --> 01:58:24,282
Yes, sir.

1257
01:58:24,282 --> 01:58:26,405
You do understand what I'm saying?

1258
01:58:26,993 --> 01:58:29,663
Should I tell you to hide, you hide.

1259
01:58:29,663 --> 01:58:32,165
Should I tell you to run, you run.

1260
01:58:32,165 --> 01:58:36,163
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself, you must do so.

1261
01:58:41,341 --> 01:58:42,918
Your word, Harry.

1262
01:58:44,552 --> 01:58:46,047
My word.

1263
01:58:46,846 --> 01:58:48,506
Take my arm.

1264
01:58:49,933 --> 01:58:52,340
Sir, I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1265
01:58:53,019 --> 01:58:56,472
Well, being me has its privileges.

1266
01:59:43,738 --> 01:59:45,362
This is the place.

1267
01:59:46,157 --> 01:59:47,734
Oh, yes.

1268
01:59:48,659 --> 01:59:51,233
This place has known magic.

1269
01:59:59,253 --> 02:00:00,963
- Sir!
- In order to gain passage...

1270
02:00:00,963 --> 02:00:02,548
...payment must be made.

1271
02:00:02,548 --> 02:00:06,166
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1272
02:00:07,762 --> 02:00:10,056
- You should've let me, sir.
- No, Harry.

1273
02:00:10,056 --> 02:00:12,761
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1274
02:00:34,665 --> 02:00:39,461
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1275
02:00:39,461 --> 02:00:42,795
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1276
02:00:45,384 --> 02:00:46,794
Careful.

1277
02:01:10,325 --> 02:01:11,440
There it is.

1278
02:01:12,953 --> 02:01:15,658
The only question is,
how do we get there?

1279
02:01:37,854 --> 02:01:39,681
If you would, Harry.

1280
02:02:26,986 --> 02:02:29,394
Do you think the Horcrux is in there, sir?

1281
02:02:30,031 --> 02:02:31,406
Oh, yes.

1282
02:02:42,502 --> 02:02:44,253
It has to be drunk.

1283
02:02:44,253 --> 02:02:47,090
All of it has to be drunk.

1284
02:02:47,925 --> 02:02:51,428
You remember the conditions on which
I brought you with me?

1285
02:02:51,428 --> 02:02:54,264
This potion might paralyze me.

1286
02:02:54,264 --> 02:02:55,924
Might make me forget why I'm here.

1287
02:02:56,725 --> 02:03:00,270
Might cause me so much pain
that I beg for relief.

1288
02:03:00,270 --> 02:03:02,356
You are not to indulge these requests.

1289
02:03:02,356 --> 02:03:06,068
It's your job, Harry, to make sure
I keep drinking this potion.

1290
02:03:06,068 --> 02:03:08,988
Even if you have to force it
down my throat.

1291
02:03:08,988 --> 02:03:11,281
- Understood?
- Why can't I drink it, sir?

1292
02:03:11,281 --> 02:03:16,703
Because I am much older, much cleverer,
and much less valuable.

1293
02:03:20,624 --> 02:03:22,700
Your good health, Harry.

1294
02:03:38,851 --> 02:03:40,131
Professor.

1295
02:03:42,271 --> 02:03:43,469
Professor!

1296
02:03:50,154 --> 02:03:51,822
Harry.

1297
02:03:51,822 --> 02:03:54,313
Professor, can you hear me?

1298
02:03:55,617 --> 02:03:56,780
Professor.

1299
02:04:12,218 --> 02:04:13,511
No. Don't.

1300
02:04:13,511 --> 02:04:15,837
You have to keep drinking,
like you said. Remember?

1301
02:04:25,106 --> 02:04:27,150
- Stop.
- It will stop. It will stop...

1302
02:04:27,150 --> 02:04:31,738
...but only if you keep drinking.
- Please, don't make me.

1303
02:04:31,738 --> 02:04:34,032
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Please.

1304
02:04:34,032 --> 02:04:36,321
- Kill me. Kill me!
- No!

1305
02:04:38,244 --> 02:04:39,324
It's my fault.

1306
02:04:40,997 --> 02:04:42,195
It's all my fault.

1307
02:04:44,042 --> 02:04:45,835
It's my fault.

1308
02:04:45,835 --> 02:04:49,204
Just one more, sir.
One more, and then I promise...

1309
02:04:49,881 --> 02:04:52,384
...I promise I'll do what you say.

1310
02:04:52,384 --> 02:04:54,210
- I promise.
- No.

1311
02:04:55,261 --> 02:04:56,637
Please.

1312
02:05:20,788 --> 02:05:22,247
Harry.

1313
02:05:29,380 --> 02:05:30,411
Water.

1314
02:05:31,424 --> 02:05:32,717
Water.

1315
02:05:32,717 --> 02:05:34,508
Water.

1316
02:05:41,017 --> 02:05:42,977
You did it, sir.

1317
02:05:42,977 --> 02:05:44,436
Look.

1318
02:05:46,439 --> 02:05:47,684
Harry.

1319
02:05:49,066 --> 02:05:50,395
Water.

1320
02:05:52,153 --> 02:05:54,030
<I>Aguamenti.</I>

1321
02:05:54,030 --> 02:05:55,488
Water.

1322
02:06:31,651 --> 02:06:33,026
<I>Lumos.</I>

1323
02:07:01,473 --> 02:07:03,382
<I>Lumos Maxima!</I>

1324
02:07:12,859 --> 02:07:14,686
Harry.

1325
02:07:18,740 --> 02:07:20,033
<I>Sectumsempra!</I>

1326
02:07:20,033 --> 02:07:21,196
Harry.

1327
02:07:22,160 --> 02:07:23,785
<I>- Stupefy!</I>
<I>- Harry.</I>

1328
02:08:22,972 --> 02:08:24,253
Harry.

1329
02:08:28,269 --> 02:08:30,594
<I>Partis Temporus!</I>

1330
02:09:13,148 --> 02:09:16,268
Go to your houses. No dawdling.

1331
02:09:57,109 --> 02:10:00,810
We need to get you to the hospital
wing, sir, to Madam Pomfrey.

1332
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:04,615
No.

1333
02:10:05,659 --> 02:10:08,495
Severus. Severus is who I need.

1334
02:10:08,495 --> 02:10:12,207
Wake him. Tell him what happened.

1335
02:10:12,207 --> 02:10:13,867
Speak to no one else.

1336
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:16,708
Severus, Harry.

1337
02:10:22,009 --> 02:10:24,417
Hide yourself below, Harry.

1338
02:10:25,889 --> 02:10:29,059
Don't speak or be seen by anybody
without my permission.

1339
02:10:29,059 --> 02:10:32,843
Whatever happens,
it's imperative you stay below.

1340
02:10:33,646 --> 02:10:35,306
Harry, do as I say.

1341
02:10:38,943 --> 02:10:40,224
Trust me.

1342
02:10:41,988 --> 02:10:43,447
Trust me.

1343
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:05,837
Good evening, Draco.

1344
02:11:06,721 --> 02:11:10,433
What brings you here
on this fine spring evening?

1345
02:11:10,433 --> 02:11:12,352
Who else is here? I heard you talking.

1346
02:11:12,352 --> 02:11:16,432
I often talk aloud to
myself. I find it extraordinarily useful.

1347
02:11:18,566 --> 02:11:21,402
Have you been whispering
to yourself, Draco?

1348
02:11:23,905 --> 02:11:25,364
Draco...

1349
02:11:26,032 --> 02:11:29,160
...you are no assassin.
- How do you know what I am?

1350
02:11:29,160 --> 02:11:31,121
I've done things that would shock you.

1351
02:11:31,121 --> 02:11:35,417
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping that in
return she'd bear a cursed necklace to me?

1352
02:11:35,417 --> 02:11:38,211
Replacing a bottle of mead
with one laced with poison?

1353
02:11:38,211 --> 02:11:39,964
Forgive me, Draco.

1354
02:11:39,964 --> 02:11:42,633
I cannot help feeling these actions
are so weak...

1355
02:11:42,633 --> 02:11:45,177
...your heart can't really
have been in them.

1356
02:11:45,177 --> 02:11:48,381
He trusts me. I was chosen.

1357
02:11:52,184 --> 02:11:54,145
Then I shall make it easy for you.

1358
02:11:54,145 --> 02:11:55,805
<I>Expelliarmus!</I>

1359
02:11:59,150 --> 02:12:01,475
Very good. Very good.

1360
02:12:03,237 --> 02:12:04,696
You're not alone.

1361
02:12:05,781 --> 02:12:06,813
There are others.

1362
02:12:08,868 --> 02:12:10,279
How?

1363
02:12:11,579 --> 02:12:14,248
The vanishing cabinet
in the Room of Requirement.

1364
02:12:14,999 --> 02:12:17,543
- I've been mending it.
- Let me guess.

1365
02:12:17,543 --> 02:12:20,671
It has a sister. A twin.

1366
02:12:20,671 --> 02:12:23,049
In Borgin and Burkes.
They form a passage.

1367
02:12:23,049 --> 02:12:24,840
Ingenious.

1368
02:12:25,509 --> 02:12:26,927
Draco...

1369
02:12:26,927 --> 02:12:33,013
...years ago, I knew a boy
who made all the wrong choices.

1370
02:12:33,934 --> 02:12:36,852
- Please let me help you.
- I don't want your help!

1371
02:12:37,646 --> 02:12:41,146
Don't you understand? I have to do this.

1372
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:44,020
I have to kill you.

1373
02:12:44,654 --> 02:12:46,693
Or he's gonna kill me.

1374
02:12:56,207 --> 02:12:59,826
Well, look what we have here.

1375
02:13:01,713 --> 02:13:03,872
Well done, Draco.

1376
02:13:07,552 --> 02:13:09,379
Good evening, Bellatrix.

1377
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:12,766
I think introductions
are in order, don't you?

1378
02:13:12,766 --> 02:13:17,891
Love to, Albus, but I'm afraid
we're all on a bit of a tight schedule.

1379
02:13:18,522 --> 02:13:19,897
Do it.

1380
02:13:21,191 --> 02:13:25,737
He doesn't have the stomach,
just like his father.

1381
02:13:25,737 --> 02:13:27,406
Let me finish him in my own way.

1382
02:13:27,406 --> 02:13:31,201
No! The Dark Lord was clear,
the boy is to do it.

1383
02:13:31,201 --> 02:13:33,241
This is your moment. Do it.

1384
02:13:34,788 --> 02:13:36,957
Go on, Draco.

1385
02:13:36,957 --> 02:13:39,115
Now!

1386
02:13:40,377 --> 02:13:41,705
No.

1387
02:13:53,598 --> 02:13:55,141
Severus.

1388
02:14:04,151 --> 02:14:05,609
Please.

1389
02:14:06,611 --> 02:14:07,940
<I>Avada Kedavra.</I>

1390
02:15:12,345 --> 02:15:15,973
Hagrid! Hello?

1391
02:15:15,973 --> 02:15:20,018
Snape! He trusted you!

1392
02:15:24,357 --> 02:15:25,981
Go on.

1393
02:15:26,651 --> 02:15:28,528
<I>Incarcerous.</I>

1394
02:15:28,528 --> 02:15:31,198
Fight back! You coward, fight back!

1395
02:15:32,825 --> 02:15:36,028
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord.

1396
02:15:56,181 --> 02:15:57,557
<I>Sectumsempra!</I>

1397
02:16:06,025 --> 02:16:11,267
You dare use my own spells
against me, Potter?

1398
02:16:12,031 --> 02:16:13,193
Yes.

1399
02:16:13,907 --> 02:16:18,071
I'm the Half-Blood Prince.

1400
02:20:06,143 --> 02:20:07,601
McGONAGALL:
Potter...

1401
02:20:08,311 --> 02:20:10,803
...in light of what has happened...

1402
02:20:12,232 --> 02:20:15,518
...if you should have the need
to talk to someone...

1403
02:20:17,487 --> 02:20:21,485
You should know,
Professor Dumbledore...

1404
02:20:23,327 --> 02:20:25,782
...you meant a great deal to him.

1405
02:20:44,057 --> 02:20:46,392
Do you think he would've done it?

1406
02:20:46,392 --> 02:20:48,266
Draco?

1407
02:20:49,354 --> 02:20:50,682
No.

1408
02:20:51,856 --> 02:20:53,896
No, he was lowering his wand.

1409
02:20:54,942 --> 02:20:56,900
In the end, it was Snape.

1410
02:20:57,528 --> 02:21:00,156
It was always Snape.

1411
02:21:00,156 --> 02:21:02,362
And I did nothing.

1412
02:21:09,040 --> 02:21:10,451
It's fake.

1413
02:21:12,043 --> 02:21:13,371
Open it.

1414
02:21:24,389 --> 02:21:28,559
"To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead
long before you read this...

1415
02:21:28,559 --> 02:21:32,225
...but I want you to know that it was I
who discovered your secret.

1416
02:21:33,231 --> 02:21:37,276
I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend
to destroy it as soon as I can.

1417
02:21:37,276 --> 02:21:40,488
I face death in the hope that
when you meet your match...

1418
02:21:40,488 --> 02:21:42,730
...you will be mortal once more.

1419
02:21:44,033 --> 02:21:45,693
R.A.B."

1420
02:21:46,953 --> 02:21:48,788
R.A.B.

1421
02:21:48,788 --> 02:21:50,068
Don't know.

1422
02:21:52,084 --> 02:21:54,753
But whoever they are,
they have the real Horcrux.

1423
02:21:55,713 --> 02:21:57,255
Which means it was all a waste.

1424
02:21:58,590 --> 02:22:00,085
All of it.

1425
02:22:06,306 --> 02:22:08,383
Ron's okay with it, you know.

1426
02:22:08,892 --> 02:22:10,387
You and Ginny.

1427
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:14,720
But if I were you, when he's around,
I'd keep the snogging to a minimum.

1428
02:22:16,066 --> 02:22:18,059
I'm not coming back, Hermione.

1429
02:22:19,236 --> 02:22:22,114
I've got to finish
whatever Dumbledore started.

1430
02:22:22,114 --> 02:22:25,117
And I don't know where that'll lead me...

1431
02:22:25,117 --> 02:22:28,735
...but I'll let you and Ron know
where I am when I can.

1432
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:32,875
I've always admired your courage, Harry.

1433
02:22:32,875 --> 02:22:35,544
But sometimes, you can be really thick.

1434
02:22:38,589 --> 02:22:41,008
You don't really think
you're going to be able...

1435
02:22:41,008 --> 02:22:43,380
...to find all those Horcruxes
by yourself, do you?

1436
02:22:47,639 --> 02:22:49,299
You need us, Harry.

1437
02:23:05,115 --> 02:23:08,201
I never realized
how beautiful this place was.
