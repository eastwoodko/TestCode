1
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:50,305
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:40,591
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:45,162
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:50,534
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:50,534 --> 00:02:53,203
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,605
I only meant...

7
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:57,741
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:57,741 --> 00:03:00,310
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,014
Lt cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:07,150
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,954
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:14,191
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:16,421
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:31,808
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:35,679
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:35,679 --> 00:03:41,151
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:42,982
Avada Kedavra!

18
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,515
Harry.

19
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,921
Harry!

20
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,027
Are you all right?

21
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:58,001
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:01,538
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:02,939
Last night.

24
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:05,342
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:05,342 --> 00:04:06,777
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:08,301
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:10,947
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:10,947 --> 00:04:14,280
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:20,957 --> 00:04:24,261
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:27,698
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:29,222
Keep up!

32
00:04:31,802 --> 00:04:33,804
Arthur!

33
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:35,972
Lt's about time, son.

34
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:40,510
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,383
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:49,052
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:50,387
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:52,048
This way.

39
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,327
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:57,327 --> 00:05:00,230
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,027
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:07,330
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:05:09,606 --> 00:05:11,575
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:12,943
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:17,073
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:20,584
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:23,253
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:23,253 --> 00:05:24,788
Time to go!

49
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:26,556
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:26,556 --> 00:05:30,761
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

51
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:31,853
...three!

52
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:44,207
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:46,801
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:01,415
L'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:04,960
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:13,136
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:13,136 --> 00:06:17,664
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:23,305
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,110
Look!

60
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:29,281
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:37,761
Blimey!

62
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:39,796
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:39,796 --> 00:06:41,364
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:42,833
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:44,528
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,232
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:54,567
What?

68
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:04,054
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:05,522
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:07:05,522 --> 00:07:08,013
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,228
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:13,864
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:16,128
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:19,562
I love magic.

75
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:38,555
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:41,892
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,560
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,462
Lf it rains...

79
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:47,828
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:51,134
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:51,134 --> 00:07:54,571
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:56,940
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,033
There's no need with these people.

84
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,414
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:06,245
While you can.

86
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:24,501
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:26,366
Come on!

88
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,740
Lt's the lrish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,571
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:41,149
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

91
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:48,585
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:56,029
Who's that?

93
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:59,826
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:05,398
Krum! Krum! Krum!

95
00:09:10,146 --> 00:09:11,548
Krum!

96
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,277
Yes!

97
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:22,924
Good evening!

98
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,696
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,722
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:34,270
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,140
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:40,777 --> 00:09:42,512
Let the match...

103
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:44,104
...begin!

104
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,414
Krum! Krum! Krum!

105
00:10:00,263 --> 00:10:02,098
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:03,867
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:07,103
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:10,173
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:11,741
He's an artist.

110
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:14,177
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:14,177 --> 00:10:15,745
Viktor, I love you

112
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,514
viktor, I do

113
00:10:17,514 --> 00:10:20,917
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

114
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:23,753
Sounds like the lrish
have got their pride on.

115
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,482
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:27,614
Lt's not the lrish.

117
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,919
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:35,565
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:39,102
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:39,102 --> 00:10:41,764
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:44,240
Go!

122
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,071
Harry!

123
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,051
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

124
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:06,454
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,600
Morsmordre!

126
00:12:22,372 --> 00:12:23,862
Harry!

127
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:28,572
- Where are you?
- Harry!

128
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:32,440
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,381
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:36,186 --> 00:12:38,177
What is that?

131
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,526
Stupefy!

132
00:12:43,526 --> 00:12:45,028
Stop!

133
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:47,258
That's my son!

134
00:12:48,298 --> 00:12:51,134
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:52,602
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:54,938
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:12:54,938 --> 00:12:57,106
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:57,106 --> 00:12:59,309
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,977
What crime?

140
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:03,646
Lt's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.

141
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:04,806
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:05,982 --> 00:13:10,019
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,455
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:12,455 --> 00:13:14,320
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:19,562
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:13:19,562 --> 00:13:21,097
There!

147
00:13:21,097 --> 00:13:23,395
All of you, this way!

148
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,868
A man, Harry?

149
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,770
Who?

150
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,533
I don't know.

151
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,369
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:51,617
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,858
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:00,803 --> 00:14:02,705
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:05,074
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:14:05,074 --> 00:14:06,871
...and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:14:08,344 --> 00:14:10,580
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

158
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:14,573
- It's all right, l'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:18,252
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:25,253
Thank you.

161
00:14:25,895 --> 00:14:28,090
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:31,263
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:14:32,168 --> 00:14:34,370
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,773
This is horrible.

165
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:39,709
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,611
Wasn't there any security or?

167
00:14:41,611 --> 00:14:44,580
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,539
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:54,757
It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.

170
00:14:54,757 --> 00:14:56,418
I'm fine.

171
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:01,531
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:15:01,531 --> 00:15:05,490
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:17,140
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:58,617
Clear the runway!

175
00:16:04,026 --> 00:16:06,790
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:35,690
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

177
00:16:36,692 --> 00:16:40,263
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:43,800
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,428
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

180
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,071
Yes, what is it?

181
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:50,436
What is it?

182
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:56,312
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:56,312 --> 00:17:02,418
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:17:02,418 --> 00:17:04,477
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:07,256
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

186
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:10,593
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:12,895
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:17:12,895 --> 00:17:16,599
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,468
Now let me be clear.

190
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:21,571
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:23,673
And trust me when I say...

192
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:26,943
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:17:26,943 --> 00:17:31,447
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:35,651
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:17:35,651 --> 00:17:39,644
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,759
Bloody hell.

197
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:03,943
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:18:25,968 --> 00:18:28,204
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:31,207
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:34,040
...and their high master,
lgor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:58,834
Oh, it's Krum!

202
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:00,469
Blimey, it's him!

203
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:02,334
Viktor Krum!

204
00:19:11,247 --> 00:19:12,848
Albus.

205
00:19:12,848 --> 00:19:14,577
Igor.

206
00:19:28,197 --> 00:19:32,034
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:34,737
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

208
00:19:34,737 --> 00:19:38,441
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:40,705
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,576
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:51,481
You idiot!

212
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:58,483
Your attention, please!

213
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,991
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:07,236
Eternal glory.

215
00:20:07,236 --> 00:20:11,440
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,811
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:20,216
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:21,384
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

219
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:25,788
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:27,323
To explain all this...

221
00:20:27,323 --> 00:20:31,127
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

222
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:33,288
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,440
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:54,583
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

225
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:58,041
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:01,848
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

227
00:21:13,636 --> 00:21:17,573
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

228
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:18,665
Thank you.

229
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:27,483
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

230
00:21:27,483 --> 00:21:30,475
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,562
After due consideration...

232
00:21:39,562 --> 00:21:42,631
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

233
00:21:42,631 --> 00:21:45,768
...no student under the age of 17...

234
00:21:45,768 --> 00:21:49,672
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:52,541
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

236
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,311
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

237
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:59,042
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

238
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:20,868
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:24,507
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:22:24,507 --> 00:22:27,576
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:22:27,576 --> 00:22:30,670
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:22:31,781 --> 00:22:34,383
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:22:34,383 --> 00:22:38,120
If chosen, there's no turning back.

244
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,080
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,310
Alastor Moody.

246
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:14,882
Ex-Auror...

247
00:23:16,592 --> 00:23:19,228
...Ministry malcontent...

248
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:21,797
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:23:21,797 --> 00:23:26,435
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

250
00:23:26,435 --> 00:23:28,198
Any questions?

251
00:23:31,373 --> 00:23:33,102
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:23:34,476 --> 00:23:37,313
...I believe in a practical approach.

253
00:23:37,313 --> 00:23:43,013
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:23:43,552 --> 00:23:46,055
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

255
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:49,458
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

256
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:53,762
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

257
00:23:53,762 --> 00:23:56,665
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:23:56,665 --> 00:24:00,302
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

259
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:02,638
You need to be prepared.

260
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:05,274
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:07,743
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:24:07,743 --> 00:24:10,735
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:13,210
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:24:15,551 --> 00:24:19,221
So which curse shall we see first?

265
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,623
- Weasley!
- Yes?

266
00:24:20,623 --> 00:24:21,954
Stand.

267
00:24:25,127 --> 00:24:27,062
Give us a curse.

268
00:24:27,062 --> 00:24:30,930
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,935
The lmperius Curse.

270
00:24:32,935 --> 00:24:36,639
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

271
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:39,775
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:42,266
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:24:49,885 --> 00:24:51,216
Hello.

274
00:24:52,855 --> 00:24:54,550
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:24:57,693 --> 00:25:00,062
Engorgio.

276
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:01,723
Imperio!

277
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:08,569
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

278
00:25:14,743 --> 00:25:16,404
If she bites...

279
00:25:16,946 --> 00:25:18,436
...she's lethal.

280
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:22,780
What are you laughing at?

281
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:25,552
Get off!

282
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,925
Talented, isn't she?

283
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:33,326
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:25:35,297 --> 00:25:36,696
Drown herself?

285
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:51,914
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:25:51,914 --> 00:25:56,085
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

287
00:25:56,085 --> 00:25:58,487
...under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.

288
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:00,756
But here's the rub:

289
00:26:00,756 --> 00:26:03,748
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:07,790
Another, another.

291
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:10,499
Up, up. Come on.

292
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:12,057
Longbottom, is it?

293
00:26:12,735 --> 00:26:14,225
Up.

294
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:20,139
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:23,912
There's the...

296
00:26:23,912 --> 00:26:26,015
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:26:26,015 --> 00:26:29,084
Correct, correct. Come, come.

298
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:30,711
Particularly nasty.

299
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:35,587
The torture curse.

300
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:38,753
Crucio!

301
00:26:51,473 --> 00:26:55,273
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:16,888
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

303
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:20,665
No?

304
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,997
Avada Kedavra!

305
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:29,300
The Killing Curse.

306
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:33,574
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:36,515
...and he's sitting in this room.

308
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:10,052
Brilliant, isn't he?

309
00:28:10,052 --> 00:28:14,256
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:17,593
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

311
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:20,362
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:24,458
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

313
00:28:27,402 --> 00:28:29,037
Neville?

314
00:28:29,037 --> 00:28:30,839
Son?

315
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,466
You all right?

316
00:28:33,442 --> 00:28:36,809
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,351
We're gonna be late!

318
00:29:06,942 --> 00:29:09,274
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:27,563
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

320
00:29:27,563 --> 00:29:30,365
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:32,167
Yeah, rather you than me.

322
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:34,101
Yes!

323
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:38,373
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:41,610
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,771
It's not going to work.

326
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,649
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

327
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:50,786
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:52,754
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:29:52,754 --> 00:29:54,187
So?

330
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:59,561
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:02,731
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:06,997
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:30:08,737 --> 00:30:10,906
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

334
00:30:10,906 --> 00:30:12,737
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

335
00:30:16,178 --> 00:30:18,078
- Yes!
- Yes!

336
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,414
Yeah!

337
00:30:21,583 --> 00:30:23,652
Yes!

338
00:30:23,652 --> 00:30:25,142
Ready?

339
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:30,584
- Yes!
- Yes!

340
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:41,102
- You said!
- You said!

341
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,674
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- L'll tear your ears off!

342
00:30:45,674 --> 00:30:48,343
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

343
00:30:48,343 --> 00:30:49,776
Fight! Fight! Fight!

344
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:56,785
We're "old school," right?

345
00:30:56,785 --> 00:30:59,185
Yeah, but you look older!

346
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:33,214
Sit down. Please.

347
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:39,661
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:41,788
The champion selection.

349
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:17,028
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:35,550
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,575
...is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,122
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

353
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:05,747
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:33:05,747 --> 00:33:10,118
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

355
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:13,755
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:16,958
...this vessel of victory...

357
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,153
...the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:51,586
Harry Potter.

359
00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:55,322
Harry Potter?

360
00:33:59,701 --> 00:34:01,896
No. No.

361
00:34:02,404 --> 00:34:04,139
Harry Potter!

362
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:05,807
Go on, Harry.

363
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,570
Harry, for goodness sake.

364
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:40,268
He's a cheat!

365
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:43,369
He's not even 17 yet!

366
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:14,910
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

367
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:18,046
- Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
- Quiet! I can't think!

368
00:35:18,046 --> 00:35:20,215
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

369
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:21,583
- Harry.
- I protest!

370
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,618
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:35:23,618 --> 00:35:25,954
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:35:25,954 --> 00:35:27,455
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

373
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:30,792
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

374
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,228
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

375
00:35:33,228 --> 00:35:35,764
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:39,067
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

377
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:41,236
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:35:41,236 --> 00:35:44,406
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

379
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:47,742
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

380
00:35:47,742 --> 00:35:50,836
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

381
00:35:52,614 --> 00:35:54,912
Leave this to you, Barty.

382
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:58,479
The rules are absolute.

383
00:35:59,688 --> 00:36:03,419
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,155
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:10,295
He is, as of tonight...

386
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,125
...a Triwizard champion.

387
00:36:42,063 --> 00:36:44,532
This can't go on, Albus.

388
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:47,535
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:49,526
What do you suggest, Minerva?

390
00:36:50,705 --> 00:36:53,241
Put an end to it.

391
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:55,410
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,046
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:36:58,046 --> 00:37:01,049
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:37:01,049 --> 00:37:03,652
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:07,822
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:37:07,822 --> 00:37:11,926
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:15,521
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

398
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:18,867
...let them unfold.

399
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:21,202
What...? Do nothing?

400
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:22,829
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:26,671
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

402
00:37:27,575 --> 00:37:30,305
I agree. With Severus.

403
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:33,982
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

404
00:37:33,982 --> 00:37:36,718
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

405
00:37:36,718 --> 00:37:39,812
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:37:40,355 --> 00:37:43,391
...knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:37:43,391 --> 00:37:45,951
Then again, we all are.

408
00:38:00,842 --> 00:38:02,639
How did you do it?

409
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:08,917
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.

410
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:12,387
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

411
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:15,256
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

412
00:38:15,256 --> 00:38:17,025
Okay?

413
00:38:17,025 --> 00:38:19,694
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

414
00:38:19,694 --> 00:38:23,221
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

415
00:38:26,935 --> 00:38:29,337
I didn't put my name in that cup.

416
00:38:29,337 --> 00:38:33,171
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

417
00:38:34,943 --> 00:38:39,581
Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

418
00:38:39,581 --> 00:38:40,809
It just did.

419
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:43,241
Okay?

420
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,823
Piss off.

421
00:39:09,643 --> 00:39:12,111
What a charismatic quartet.

422
00:39:13,447 --> 00:39:15,039
Hello.

423
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:18,476
I'm Rita Skeeter.

424
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:21,544
I write for the Daily Prophet.

425
00:39:22,156 --> 00:39:26,855
But of course you know that, don't you?
Lt's you we don't know.

426
00:39:27,394 --> 00:39:29,396
You're the juicy news.

427
00:39:29,396 --> 00:39:33,801
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

428
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:37,438
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

429
00:39:37,438 --> 00:39:40,841
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

430
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:43,867
In short, what makes a champion tick?

431
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:48,849
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

432
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:51,340
So who's feeling up to sharing?

433
00:39:54,655 --> 00:39:57,249
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

434
00:40:09,536 --> 00:40:11,333
This is cozy.

435
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:13,974
It's a broom cupboard.

436
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:16,477
You should feel right at home, then.

437
00:40:16,477 --> 00:40:19,413
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

438
00:40:19,413 --> 00:40:21,348
No.

439
00:40:21,348 --> 00:40:23,517
So tell me, Harry.

440
00:40:23,517 --> 00:40:26,587
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

441
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:28,255
I'm 14. Sorry.

442
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:31,392
- About to compete
against three students...

443
00:40:31,392 --> 00:40:34,828
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

444
00:40:34,828 --> 00:40:37,598
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

445
00:40:37,598 --> 00:40:39,930
...in your dizziest daydreams.

446
00:40:40,434 --> 00:40:42,459
Concerned?

447
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:46,640
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

448
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,976
Just ignore the quill.

449
00:40:48,976 --> 00:40:51,679
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

450
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,273
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

451
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:57,384
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

452
00:40:57,384 --> 00:41:00,788
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

453
00:41:00,788 --> 00:41:02,723
No, I didn't enter.

454
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:04,315
Of course you didn't.

455
00:41:06,593 --> 00:41:08,220
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

456
00:41:10,531 --> 00:41:12,055
Scratch that last.

457
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:17,171
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

458
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:19,139
Proud? Or concerned...

459
00:41:19,139 --> 00:41:23,143
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

460
00:41:23,143 --> 00:41:25,737
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

461
00:41:26,747 --> 00:41:31,810
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

462
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:06,620
Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.

463
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,057
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

464
00:42:10,057 --> 00:42:12,459
...and she's too easily recognized.

465
00:42:12,459 --> 00:42:15,496
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

466
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:19,833
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

467
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:21,769
And make sure you're alone.

468
00:42:21,769 --> 00:42:23,437
Sirius.

469
00:42:23,437 --> 00:42:25,105
P. S:

470
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:26,902
The bird bites.

471
00:42:37,251 --> 00:42:38,684
Sirius?

472
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:57,638
Harry Potter, age 12...

473
00:42:57,638 --> 00:43:00,774
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

474
00:43:00,774 --> 00:43:03,544
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

475
00:43:03,544 --> 00:43:05,102
...and choking back tears...

476
00:43:20,594 --> 00:43:23,363
Sirius. How...?

477
00:43:23,363 --> 00:43:26,033
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

478
00:43:26,033 --> 00:43:29,136
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

479
00:43:29,136 --> 00:43:30,603
No!

480
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:32,639
I had to ask.

481
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:37,611
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

482
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:40,214
But who was the third man in the room?

483
00:43:40,214 --> 00:43:42,705
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

484
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,074
No.

485
00:43:45,986 --> 00:43:49,890
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

486
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:51,187
And what was that?

487
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,162
He wanted...

488
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:56,823
me

489
00:43:57,397 --> 00:44:01,731
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

490
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:05,539
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

491
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:07,341
Yes.

492
00:44:07,341 --> 00:44:08,899
It's just a dream.

493
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:11,245
Look, Harry.

494
00:44:11,245 --> 00:44:14,882
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

495
00:44:14,882 --> 00:44:19,052
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

496
00:44:19,052 --> 00:44:20,320
What are you saying?

497
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:24,758
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

498
00:44:24,758 --> 00:44:29,596
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

499
00:44:29,596 --> 00:44:34,727
Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

500
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:41,808
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

501
00:44:41,808 --> 00:44:44,278
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

502
00:44:44,278 --> 00:44:48,415
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

503
00:44:48,415 --> 00:44:51,907
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

504
00:44:55,455 --> 00:44:57,855
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

505
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:02,663
Who were you talking to?

506
00:45:02,663 --> 00:45:05,999
- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

507
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:09,992
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

508
00:45:10,537 --> 00:45:13,870
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

509
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,427
Amazing.

510
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:47,100
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

511
00:45:47,674 --> 00:45:49,073
Right, sorry.

512
00:45:49,943 --> 00:45:53,113
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

513
00:45:53,113 --> 00:45:56,276
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

514
00:45:57,784 --> 00:45:59,686
It's already been through enough people.

515
00:45:59,686 --> 00:46:01,779
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

516
00:46:03,256 --> 00:46:05,759
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

517
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:08,028
What do you want me to say again?

518
00:46:08,028 --> 00:46:09,359
Go.

519
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:16,463
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

520
00:46:17,037 --> 00:46:20,807
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

521
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:23,410
Is that right? Well, you...

522
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,468
What?

523
00:46:29,583 --> 00:46:32,518
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

524
00:46:35,322 --> 00:46:38,291
Dean was told by Parvati that...

525
00:46:39,526 --> 00:46:42,129
Please don't ask me to say it again.

526
00:46:42,129 --> 00:46:43,596
Hagrid's looking for you.

527
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:47,157
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

528
00:46:57,711 --> 00:47:00,147
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

529
00:47:00,147 --> 00:47:02,916
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

530
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,484
You'll see soon enough.

531
00:47:04,484 --> 00:47:06,679
Now pay attention, this is important.

532
00:47:08,422 --> 00:47:09,889
What's with the flower?

533
00:47:10,924 --> 00:47:13,727
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

534
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:15,896
As a matter of fact, I have.

535
00:47:15,896 --> 00:47:18,831
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

536
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,807
Hagrid?

537
00:47:32,712 --> 00:47:34,612
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

538
00:47:41,154 --> 00:47:44,724
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

539
00:47:44,724 --> 00:47:48,628
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

540
00:47:48,628 --> 00:47:51,465
...you had forgotten me.

541
00:47:51,465 --> 00:47:53,433
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

542
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:55,898
What is it you wanted to show me?

543
00:47:57,571 --> 00:48:01,141
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

544
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:02,631
...exhilarated.

545
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,043
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

546
00:48:16,623 --> 00:48:18,386
Can we get closer?

547
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:27,834
Dragons?

548
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:29,736
That's the first task?

549
00:48:29,736 --> 00:48:31,761
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

550
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,065
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

551
00:48:37,177 --> 00:48:38,644
Oh, crikey!

552
00:48:39,146 --> 00:48:44,451
Although, I have to admit,
that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.

553
00:48:44,451 --> 00:48:47,284
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

554
00:48:48,788 --> 00:48:50,991
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

555
00:48:50,991 --> 00:48:54,694
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

556
00:48:54,694 --> 00:48:56,127
Didn't Ron tell you that?

557
00:48:58,064 --> 00:48:59,463
No, he didn't.

558
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,065
He didn't tell me a thing.

559
00:49:12,012 --> 00:49:15,106
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

560
00:49:16,616 --> 00:49:19,452
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

561
00:49:19,452 --> 00:49:22,114
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

562
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:24,851
Like the badge?

563
00:49:25,425 --> 00:49:27,154
Excuse me.

564
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:32,798
Harry.

565
00:49:33,366 --> 00:49:35,502
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

566
00:49:35,502 --> 00:49:36,992
Can I have a word?

567
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:40,006
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

568
00:49:40,006 --> 00:49:42,998
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

569
00:49:45,512 --> 00:49:48,248
Dragons. That's the first task.

570
00:49:48,248 --> 00:49:51,551
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

571
00:49:51,551 --> 00:49:53,576
Are you serious?

572
00:49:54,354 --> 00:49:57,557
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

573
00:49:57,557 --> 00:49:59,993
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

574
00:49:59,993 --> 00:50:01,628
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

575
00:50:01,628 --> 00:50:04,297
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

576
00:50:04,297 --> 00:50:07,500
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

577
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,934
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

578
00:50:10,637 --> 00:50:12,272
It just happens a fair bit.

579
00:50:12,272 --> 00:50:15,508
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

580
00:50:15,508 --> 00:50:17,510
You're a right foul git, you know that?

581
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:19,946
- You think so?
- I know so.

582
00:50:19,946 --> 00:50:21,448
Anything else?

583
00:50:21,448 --> 00:50:24,940
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

584
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,915
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

585
00:50:31,691 --> 00:50:34,261
My father and I have a bet, you see.

586
00:50:34,261 --> 00:50:37,458
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

587
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:43,136
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

588
00:50:43,136 --> 00:50:46,264
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

589
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:51,233
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

590
00:50:52,145 --> 00:50:54,739
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

591
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:59,986
L'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

592
00:50:59,986 --> 00:51:03,990
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

593
00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,892
- Professor Moody!
...back-shooting...

594
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:08,793
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

595
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:13,959
- Is that a...? Ls that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

596
00:51:19,606 --> 00:51:21,540
Stand still! Stand still!

597
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:34,888
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

598
00:51:34,888 --> 00:51:36,990
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

599
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,025
Professor!

600
00:51:39,025 --> 00:51:42,762
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

601
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:45,632
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

602
00:51:45,632 --> 00:51:49,602
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

603
00:51:49,602 --> 00:51:51,797
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

604
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:56,799
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

605
00:51:57,911 --> 00:51:59,378
Away!

606
00:52:02,482 --> 00:52:04,677
You. Come with me.

607
00:52:39,721 --> 00:52:41,780
That's a Foe-Glass.

608
00:52:42,524 --> 00:52:45,093
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

609
00:52:45,093 --> 00:52:49,496
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

610
00:52:53,669 --> 00:52:56,305
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

611
00:52:56,305 --> 00:52:58,607
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

612
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:00,302
Now...

613
00:53:01,977 --> 00:53:04,810
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

614
00:53:08,717 --> 00:53:11,015
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

615
00:53:12,487 --> 00:53:13,977
Sit.

616
00:53:17,693 --> 00:53:19,092
Listen to me, Potter.

617
00:53:20,095 --> 00:53:21,430
Your pal Diggory?

618
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,890
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

619
00:53:27,035 --> 00:53:28,704
Miss Delacour?

620
00:53:28,704 --> 00:53:31,434
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

621
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:35,677
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

622
00:53:35,677 --> 00:53:38,013
...but Karkaroff's is not.

623
00:53:38,013 --> 00:53:40,015
They'll have a strategy.

624
00:53:40,015 --> 00:53:43,542
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

625
00:53:48,323 --> 00:53:50,058
Come on, Potter.

626
00:53:50,058 --> 00:53:52,151
What are your strengths?

627
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:55,264
I don't know.

628
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:58,233
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

629
00:53:58,233 --> 00:54:02,437
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

630
00:54:02,437 --> 00:54:06,066
You're allowed a wand.

631
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:14,149
Bets! Place your bets!

632
00:54:14,149 --> 00:54:16,485
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

633
00:54:16,485 --> 00:54:19,588
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

634
00:54:19,588 --> 00:54:22,624
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

635
00:54:22,624 --> 00:54:24,459
Yes, sir?

636
00:54:24,459 --> 00:54:27,189
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

637
00:54:27,696 --> 00:54:29,865
Your attention, please.

638
00:54:29,865 --> 00:54:32,459
This is a great day for all of us.

639
00:54:35,904 --> 00:54:40,309
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

640
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:43,178
Please keep your seats at all times.

641
00:54:43,178 --> 00:54:46,081
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

642
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:49,685
- Harry? Ls that you?
- Yeah.

643
00:54:49,685 --> 00:54:51,553
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

644
00:54:51,553 --> 00:54:54,613
- How are you feeling? Okay?
...the greatest of luck.

645
00:54:56,925 --> 00:55:00,495
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

646
00:55:00,495 --> 00:55:02,326
Battle a dragon.

647
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:09,126
Young love.

648
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:11,100
How...

649
00:55:13,575 --> 00:55:14,872
...stirring.

650
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:20,882
If everything goes unfortunately today...

651
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:23,819
...you two may even
make the front page.

652
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:26,221
You have no business here.

653
00:55:26,221 --> 00:55:28,590
This tent is for champions...

654
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,285
...and friends.

655
00:55:33,095 --> 00:55:37,259
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

656
00:55:40,402 --> 00:55:43,372
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

657
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:47,743
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

658
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:51,146
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

659
00:55:51,146 --> 00:55:53,273
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

660
00:55:54,583 --> 00:55:56,418
Sorry, l'll just go.

661
00:55:56,418 --> 00:55:58,387
Barty, the bag.

662
00:55:58,387 --> 00:56:00,789
Champions, in a circle around me.

663
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:04,059
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

664
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:08,163
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

665
00:56:08,163 --> 00:56:10,597
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

666
00:56:14,669 --> 00:56:16,330
The Welsh Green.

667
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:22,307
Mr. Krum.

668
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,180
The Chinese Fireball.

669
00:56:33,655 --> 00:56:36,525
The Swedish Short-Snout.

670
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:38,693
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

671
00:56:38,693 --> 00:56:40,957
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

672
00:56:44,366 --> 00:56:46,766
The Hungarian Horntail.

673
00:56:48,937 --> 00:56:52,240
These represent four
very real dragons...

674
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,477
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

675
00:56:55,477 --> 00:56:58,113
Your objective is simple:

676
00:56:58,113 --> 00:56:59,781
Collect the egg.

677
00:56:59,781 --> 00:57:02,951
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

678
00:57:02,951 --> 00:57:06,621
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

679
00:57:06,621 --> 00:57:07,952
Any questions?

680
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:11,827
Very well. Good luck, champions.

681
00:57:11,827 --> 00:57:14,660
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

682
00:57:23,271 --> 00:57:27,105
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

683
00:57:38,687 --> 00:57:42,224
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

684
00:57:42,224 --> 00:57:45,716
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

685
00:57:46,294 --> 00:57:49,388
And now our fourth and final contestant.

686
00:57:51,366 --> 00:57:54,927
Harry! Harry! Harry!

687
00:59:02,037 --> 00:59:04,972
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

688
00:59:05,473 --> 00:59:07,498
Accio Firebolt!

689
00:59:36,504 --> 00:59:38,665
- Yeah!
- Yes!

690
00:59:47,582 --> 00:59:49,015
Oh, my God.

691
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,959
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

692
01:02:33,948 --> 01:02:36,109
Yes! Yes!

693
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,210
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

694
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,312
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

695
01:03:04,312 --> 01:03:06,075
- Never!
- Never!

696
01:03:08,183 --> 01:03:09,984
Shush!

697
01:03:09,984 --> 01:03:12,646
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

698
01:03:13,688 --> 01:03:16,521
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

699
01:03:17,325 --> 01:03:19,850
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

700
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,439
What the bloody hell was that?

701
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:40,481
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

702
01:03:40,481 --> 01:03:44,508
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

703
01:03:47,689 --> 01:03:52,026
I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

704
01:03:52,026 --> 01:03:54,756
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

705
01:03:55,897 --> 01:03:58,166
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

706
01:03:58,166 --> 01:04:00,430
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

707
01:04:02,637 --> 01:04:05,868
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

708
01:04:06,808 --> 01:04:10,378
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

709
01:04:10,378 --> 01:04:12,013
No, no, no, I did.

710
01:04:12,013 --> 01:04:15,216
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

711
01:04:15,216 --> 01:04:19,454
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

712
01:04:19,454 --> 01:04:23,390
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

713
01:04:24,392 --> 01:04:27,629
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

714
01:04:27,629 --> 01:04:29,998
...after you'd figured that out.

715
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:32,660
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

716
01:04:33,334 --> 01:04:34,936
That's completely mental.

717
01:04:34,936 --> 01:04:38,139
Yeah. Isn't it?

718
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:40,164
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

719
01:04:42,777 --> 01:04:44,472
Boys.

720
01:05:08,937 --> 01:05:10,370
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

721
01:05:14,008 --> 01:05:16,602
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

722
01:05:20,548 --> 01:05:22,243
Shush.

723
01:05:22,951 --> 01:05:24,316
Look at this!

724
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:28,812
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

725
01:05:29,857 --> 01:05:32,260
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

726
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:35,196
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

727
01:05:35,196 --> 01:05:37,632
Her latest prey, sources report...

728
01:05:37,632 --> 01:05:41,569
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

729
01:05:41,569 --> 01:05:45,505
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

730
01:05:46,874 --> 01:05:48,977
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

731
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:50,467
Thank you, Nigel.

732
01:05:55,283 --> 01:05:58,116
Not now, Nigel. Later.

733
01:05:59,954 --> 01:06:01,478
Go on.

734
01:06:06,828 --> 01:06:09,592
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

735
01:06:11,799 --> 01:06:13,562
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

736
01:06:21,709 --> 01:06:23,711
Mum sent me a dress.

737
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:27,982
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

738
01:06:27,982 --> 01:06:29,813
Nose down, Harry.

739
01:06:30,351 --> 01:06:34,310
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

740
01:06:36,057 --> 01:06:38,059
What are you on about?

741
01:06:38,059 --> 01:06:40,161
They're not for Ginny.

742
01:06:40,161 --> 01:06:41,560
They're for you.

743
01:06:42,530 --> 01:06:46,296
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

744
01:06:47,535 --> 01:06:49,871
The Yule Ball...

745
01:06:49,871 --> 01:06:55,207
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

746
01:06:55,943 --> 01:06:58,002
...since its inception.

747
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:02,717
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

748
01:07:02,717 --> 01:07:04,552
...gather in the Great Hall...

749
01:07:04,552 --> 01:07:08,613
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

750
01:07:10,158 --> 01:07:12,593
As representatives of the host school...

751
01:07:12,593 --> 01:07:17,999
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

752
01:07:17,999 --> 01:07:20,802
And I mean this literally, because...

753
01:07:20,802 --> 01:07:25,239
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

754
01:07:26,107 --> 01:07:27,597
...a dance.

755
01:07:31,846 --> 01:07:33,848
Silence!

756
01:07:33,848 --> 01:07:37,018
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

757
01:07:37,018 --> 01:07:39,821
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

758
01:07:39,821 --> 01:07:44,058
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

759
01:07:44,058 --> 01:07:48,256
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

760
01:07:48,996 --> 01:07:51,132
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

761
01:07:51,132 --> 01:07:52,800
Now, to dance...

762
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,671
...is to let the body breathe.

763
01:07:56,671 --> 01:08:00,174
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

764
01:08:00,174 --> 01:08:02,710
...longing to burst forth and take flight.

765
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:06,881
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

766
01:08:06,881 --> 01:08:10,184
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

767
01:08:10,184 --> 01:08:12,587
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

768
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:15,021
Will you join me, please?

769
01:08:19,627 --> 01:08:23,331
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

770
01:08:23,331 --> 01:08:26,067
- Where?
- My waist.

771
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:29,070
And extend your arm.

772
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:31,038
Mr. Filch, if you please.

773
01:08:34,108 --> 01:08:36,277
One, two, three.

774
01:08:36,277 --> 01:08:39,769
One, two, three. One, two, three.

775
01:08:43,484 --> 01:08:45,786
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

776
01:08:45,786 --> 01:08:47,121
- Never.
- Never.

777
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:50,989
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

778
01:09:14,081 --> 01:09:16,184
Why do they have to travel in packs?

779
01:09:16,184 --> 01:09:18,846
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

780
01:09:26,694 --> 01:09:30,364
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

781
01:09:30,364 --> 01:09:32,628
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

782
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:40,575
I take after my mum.

783
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:44,679
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

784
01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:46,781
No, not the maternal sort, her.

785
01:09:46,781 --> 01:09:50,518
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

786
01:09:50,518 --> 01:09:55,223
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

787
01:09:55,223 --> 01:09:57,555
He laughed so hard at that.

788
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:01,492
Very funny.

789
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:11,339
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

790
01:10:11,339 --> 01:10:14,809
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

791
01:10:14,809 --> 01:10:17,039
But enough of me. What about you?

792
01:10:34,228 --> 01:10:39,325
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

793
01:10:41,602 --> 01:10:44,505
Well, us and Neville.

794
01:10:44,505 --> 01:10:47,167
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

795
01:10:47,908 --> 01:10:51,241
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

796
01:10:53,714 --> 01:10:55,477
Now I'm really depressed.

797
01:11:01,322 --> 01:11:04,780
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

798
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:08,795
Who you going with, then?

799
01:11:11,532 --> 01:11:13,401
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

800
01:11:13,401 --> 01:11:19,040
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

801
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,941
To the ball?

802
01:11:20,941 --> 01:11:22,408
Yeah, all right.

803
01:11:26,113 --> 01:11:27,848
Oi, Hermione.

804
01:11:27,848 --> 01:11:29,650
You're a girl.

805
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:31,152
Very well spotted.

806
01:11:31,152 --> 01:11:33,086
Come with one of us?

807
01:11:37,725 --> 01:11:40,795
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

808
01:11:40,795 --> 01:11:42,463
For a girl, it's just sad.

809
01:11:42,463 --> 01:11:46,229
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

810
01:11:53,174 --> 01:11:55,165
And I said yes!

811
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:58,779
Bloody hell.

812
01:11:58,779 --> 01:12:00,614
She's lying, right?

813
01:12:00,614 --> 01:12:01,842
Lf you say so.

814
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:06,020
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

815
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:10,091
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

816
01:12:10,091 --> 01:12:11,649
Agreed.

817
01:12:36,016 --> 01:12:37,347
- Cho!
- Harry!

818
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:43,824
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

819
01:12:43,824 --> 01:12:45,416
Okay, thanks.

820
01:12:49,864 --> 01:12:50,922
Cho?

821
01:12:51,866 --> 01:12:53,424
Yes?

822
01:12:54,802 --> 01:12:57,204
Well, I just wondered if you...

823
01:12:57,204 --> 01:12:59,866
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

824
01:13:01,675 --> 01:13:03,939
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

825
01:13:04,845 --> 01:13:09,748
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

826
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,525
Harry...

827
01:13:17,525 --> 01:13:20,358
...l'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

828
01:13:21,362 --> 01:13:22,795
And...

829
01:13:23,464 --> 01:13:26,695
Well, I've said l'll go with him.

830
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:30,929
Okay. Yeah. Great.

831
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:35,276
Fine. No problem.

832
01:13:35,276 --> 01:13:36,868
Okay. Good.

833
01:13:38,145 --> 01:13:39,874
Harry?

834
01:13:40,514 --> 01:13:42,483
I really am...

835
01:13:42,483 --> 01:13:44,110
sorry

836
01:13:53,894 --> 01:13:55,563
lt's all right, Ron.

837
01:13:55,563 --> 01:13:58,933
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

838
01:13:58,933 --> 01:14:01,068
What happened to you?

839
01:14:01,068 --> 01:14:03,404
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

840
01:14:03,404 --> 01:14:06,073
- What?
- What did she say?

841
01:14:06,073 --> 01:14:07,438
No, of course.

842
01:14:09,009 --> 01:14:12,746
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

843
01:14:12,746 --> 01:14:17,183
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

844
01:14:17,918 --> 01:14:21,722
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

845
01:14:21,722 --> 01:14:25,180
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

846
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:30,130
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

847
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:34,034
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

848
01:14:34,034 --> 01:14:35,436
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

849
01:14:35,436 --> 01:14:38,496
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

850
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,400
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

851
01:14:43,043 --> 01:14:44,032
Hey!

852
01:15:01,128 --> 01:15:02,823
Bloody hell.

853
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,828
Bloody hell.

854
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:11,805
Bloody...

855
01:15:11,805 --> 01:15:13,033
Oh, bloody...

856
01:15:16,744 --> 01:15:19,613
What are those? What are those?

857
01:15:19,613 --> 01:15:22,816
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

858
01:15:22,816 --> 01:15:25,920
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

859
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:28,022
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

860
01:15:28,022 --> 01:15:33,050
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

861
01:15:35,429 --> 01:15:38,489
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

862
01:15:43,237 --> 01:15:45,068
Murder me, Harry.

863
01:15:46,473 --> 01:15:48,031
Leave it alone!

864
01:15:49,009 --> 01:15:52,613
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

865
01:15:52,613 --> 01:15:55,249
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

866
01:15:55,249 --> 01:15:59,019
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

867
01:15:59,019 --> 01:16:01,388
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

868
01:16:01,388 --> 01:16:06,485
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

869
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:09,029
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

870
01:16:09,029 --> 01:16:10,860
Don't you look...

871
01:16:11,432 --> 01:16:12,626
...dashing.

872
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,537
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

873
01:16:16,537 --> 01:16:18,539
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

874
01:16:18,539 --> 01:16:21,742
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

875
01:16:21,742 --> 01:16:23,143
- Are the first to dance.

876
01:16:23,143 --> 01:16:25,771
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

877
01:16:26,347 --> 01:16:28,076
Well, now you know.

878
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:34,054
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

879
01:16:34,054 --> 01:16:36,624
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

880
01:16:36,624 --> 01:16:38,114
Come along this way.

881
01:16:42,997 --> 01:16:44,828
Oh, come on.

882
01:16:45,666 --> 01:16:47,835
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

883
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:51,202
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

884
01:16:53,407 --> 01:16:55,807
This way. This way. Come along.

885
01:16:57,511 --> 01:16:59,913
She looks beautiful!

886
01:16:59,913 --> 01:17:01,505
Yeah, she does.

887
01:17:48,896 --> 01:17:52,457
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

888
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:55,660
No. Absolutely not.

889
01:18:00,374 --> 01:18:01,932
Hi!

890
01:18:10,684 --> 01:18:12,675
Harry, take my waist.

891
01:18:13,554 --> 01:18:14,987
- What?
- Now!

892
01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:23,420
Are you ready?

893
01:19:23,991 --> 01:19:26,255
Move your body like a hairy troll

894
01:19:27,027 --> 01:19:29,897
Learning to rock and roll

895
01:19:29,897 --> 01:19:32,491
Spin around like a crazy elf

896
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,536
Dancing by himself

897
01:19:35,536 --> 01:19:39,039
Boogie down like a unicorn

898
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:41,642
No stopping till the break of dawn

899
01:19:41,642 --> 01:19:44,678
Put your hands up in the air

900
01:19:44,678 --> 01:19:47,442
Like an ogre who just don't care

901
01:19:48,148 --> 01:19:50,810
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?

902
01:19:53,153 --> 01:19:55,348
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

903
01:19:57,524 --> 01:20:00,925
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

904
01:20:02,863 --> 01:20:04,565
May I have your arm?

905
01:20:04,565 --> 01:20:07,295
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

906
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:34,785
Hot, isn't it?

907
01:20:35,462 --> 01:20:38,966
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

908
01:20:38,966 --> 01:20:42,663
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

909
01:20:44,338 --> 01:20:46,974
What's got your wand in a knot?

910
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:50,844
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

911
01:20:50,844 --> 01:20:54,405
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

912
01:20:55,115 --> 01:20:57,718
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

913
01:20:57,718 --> 01:21:01,245
...is international
magical cooperation...

914
01:21:01,822 --> 01:21:03,380
...to make friends.

915
01:21:04,057 --> 01:21:07,220
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

916
01:21:17,204 --> 01:21:19,706
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

917
01:21:19,706 --> 01:21:21,139
No.

918
01:21:29,383 --> 01:21:31,985
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

919
01:21:31,985 --> 01:21:36,356
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

920
01:21:36,356 --> 01:21:40,193
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

921
01:21:40,193 --> 01:21:42,496
You know the solution then, don't you?

922
01:21:42,496 --> 01:21:44,665
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

923
01:21:44,665 --> 01:21:47,968
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

924
01:21:47,968 --> 01:21:50,170
And not as a last resort.

925
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:54,541
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

926
01:21:54,541 --> 01:21:56,343
Harry.

927
01:21:56,343 --> 01:21:57,811
Where have you been?

928
01:21:57,811 --> 01:22:00,302
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

929
01:22:03,116 --> 01:22:07,321
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

930
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:09,186
What's this about?

931
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:16,452
No, don't let

932
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:22,599
This magic die

933
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:27,135
The answer's there

934
01:23:25,465 --> 01:23:27,558
Let me see it again.

935
01:23:28,869 --> 01:23:31,804
Yes, the time is close now.

936
01:23:36,476 --> 01:23:38,341
Harry, at last!

937
01:23:39,646 --> 01:23:44,982
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

938
01:23:55,595 --> 01:23:56,994
You all right, Harry?

939
01:23:58,432 --> 01:24:00,195
I just got in.

940
01:24:00,801 --> 01:24:02,029
Me.

941
01:24:13,313 --> 01:24:16,750
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

942
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:20,948
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

943
01:24:22,489 --> 01:24:24,458
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

944
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:27,291
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

945
01:24:28,495 --> 01:24:33,091
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

946
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:40,507
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

947
01:24:40,507 --> 01:24:42,737
Mostly, he watches me study.

948
01:24:43,543 --> 01:24:45,636
It's a bit annoying, actually.

949
01:24:47,013 --> 01:24:49,709
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

950
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:52,074
What's that supposed to mean?

951
01:24:52,652 --> 01:24:55,822
Lt just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

952
01:24:55,822 --> 01:24:58,985
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

953
01:25:00,127 --> 01:25:01,754
And...

954
01:25:04,097 --> 01:25:05,997
...l'm scared for you.

955
01:25:06,933 --> 01:25:09,527
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

956
01:25:10,137 --> 01:25:12,806
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

957
01:25:12,806 --> 01:25:14,501
Hey, Potter!

958
01:25:20,247 --> 01:25:21,737
- Potter!
- Cedric.

959
01:25:24,451 --> 01:25:26,112
How...? How are you?

960
01:25:27,187 --> 01:25:28,586
Spectacular.

961
01:25:30,123 --> 01:25:34,127
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

962
01:25:34,127 --> 01:25:36,763
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

963
01:25:36,763 --> 01:25:38,321
Exactly.

964
01:25:39,432 --> 01:25:41,992
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

965
01:25:45,839 --> 01:25:48,433
Lt's not a bad place for a bath.

966
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:52,710
Just take your egg...

967
01:25:53,446 --> 01:25:56,176
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

968
01:26:31,384 --> 01:26:33,545
I must be out of my mind.

969
01:26:43,763 --> 01:26:45,924
I'm definitely out of my mind.

970
01:26:48,602 --> 01:26:52,038
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

971
01:26:52,038 --> 01:26:54,107
Myrtle!

972
01:26:54,107 --> 01:26:55,836
Hello, Harry.

973
01:26:56,576 --> 01:26:59,841
Long time no see.

974
01:27:04,117 --> 01:27:07,954
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

975
01:27:07,954 --> 01:27:11,558
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

976
01:27:11,558 --> 01:27:14,060
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

977
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:15,823
Polyjuice Potion?

978
01:27:16,596 --> 01:27:20,623
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

979
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,135
That's what he did.

980
01:27:29,976 --> 01:27:31,637
The other boy...

981
01:27:33,046 --> 01:27:35,105
...the handsome one...

982
01:27:36,416 --> 01:27:37,644
...Cedric.

983
01:27:41,054 --> 01:27:43,716
Well, go on. Open it.

984
01:27:51,831 --> 01:27:57,003
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

985
01:27:57,003 --> 01:28:01,841
We cannot sing
Above the ground

986
01:28:01,841 --> 01:28:06,210
An hour long you'll have to look

987
01:28:06,946 --> 01:28:11,610
To recover what we took

988
01:28:19,793 --> 01:28:21,021
Myrtle...

989
01:28:22,696 --> 01:28:26,132
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

990
01:28:27,033 --> 01:28:28,694
Very good.

991
01:28:29,569 --> 01:28:33,938
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

992
01:28:34,441 --> 01:28:38,207
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

993
01:28:55,862 --> 01:28:57,830
Harry, tell me again.

994
01:28:59,532 --> 01:29:02,535
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

995
01:29:02,535 --> 01:29:05,095
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

996
01:29:06,072 --> 01:29:08,775
"An hour long you'll have to look."

997
01:29:08,775 --> 01:29:12,233
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

998
01:29:13,613 --> 01:29:15,648
"Potentially problematic"?

999
01:29:15,648 --> 01:29:18,913
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1000
01:29:19,452 --> 01:29:23,957
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1001
01:29:23,957 --> 01:29:26,626
Hate to break up the skull session.

1002
01:29:26,626 --> 01:29:28,862
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1003
01:29:28,862 --> 01:29:31,431
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1004
01:29:31,431 --> 01:29:34,267
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1005
01:29:34,267 --> 01:29:37,036
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1006
01:29:37,036 --> 01:29:39,072
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1007
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,563
Go. Now!

1008
01:29:51,551 --> 01:29:53,520
Longbottom!

1009
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,545
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1010
01:30:04,197 --> 01:30:06,566
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1011
01:30:06,566 --> 01:30:09,160
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1012
01:30:09,769 --> 01:30:14,274
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1013
01:30:14,274 --> 01:30:18,005
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1014
01:30:18,611 --> 01:30:20,680
...about plants.

1015
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,549
Now, if there's...

1016
01:30:22,549 --> 01:30:27,520
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1017
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,190
...then great. But otherwise...

1018
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:33,990
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1019
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:38,231
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1020
01:30:38,231 --> 01:30:39,866
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1021
01:30:39,866 --> 01:30:41,468
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1022
01:30:41,468 --> 01:30:43,803
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1023
01:30:43,803 --> 01:30:45,327
Don't be so mean.

1024
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:47,770
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1025
01:30:49,943 --> 01:30:52,111
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1026
01:30:52,111 --> 01:30:54,214
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1027
01:30:54,214 --> 01:30:55,882
Most likely?

1028
01:30:55,882 --> 01:30:58,251
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1029
01:30:58,251 --> 01:31:00,887
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1030
01:31:00,887 --> 01:31:03,723
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1031
01:31:03,723 --> 01:31:05,859
I just wanted to help.

1032
01:31:05,859 --> 01:31:09,128
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1033
01:31:09,128 --> 01:31:11,064
Where are they anyway?

1034
01:31:11,064 --> 01:31:14,090
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1035
01:31:21,107 --> 01:31:23,510
Welcome to the second task.

1036
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:27,380
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1037
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:28,915
A treasure of sorts.

1038
01:31:28,915 --> 01:31:31,718
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1039
01:31:31,718 --> 01:31:34,587
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1040
01:31:34,587 --> 01:31:36,322
In order to win...

1041
01:31:36,322 --> 01:31:40,326
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1042
01:31:40,326 --> 01:31:43,129
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1043
01:31:43,129 --> 01:31:46,933
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1044
01:31:46,933 --> 01:31:51,337
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1045
01:31:51,337 --> 01:31:53,601
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1046
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:23,068
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1047
01:32:24,404 --> 01:32:27,396
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1048
01:32:29,242 --> 01:32:31,142
Yeah!

1049
01:32:32,312 --> 01:32:33,939
What?

1050
01:33:53,526 --> 01:33:55,828
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1051
01:33:55,828 --> 01:33:58,353
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1052
01:33:58,998 --> 01:34:02,092
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1053
01:35:19,879 --> 01:35:21,744
But she's my friend too!

1054
01:35:23,316 --> 01:35:25,045
Only one!

1055
01:36:16,402 --> 01:36:18,267
Let's get down below.

1056
01:36:28,247 --> 01:36:31,114
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1057
01:37:28,641 --> 01:37:30,370
Yes!

1058
01:37:48,494 --> 01:37:50,553
Ascendio!

1059
01:37:55,801 --> 01:37:57,496
Harry!

1060
01:37:59,805 --> 01:38:01,272
He's all right.

1061
01:38:02,475 --> 01:38:04,076
He's all right. Barty!

1062
01:38:04,076 --> 01:38:07,512
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1063
01:38:08,114 --> 01:38:11,606
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1064
01:38:12,251 --> 01:38:14,353
My little sister.

1065
01:38:14,353 --> 01:38:15,911
Thank you.

1066
01:38:16,722 --> 01:38:19,452
And you! You helped.

1067
01:38:20,092 --> 01:38:23,118
Well, yeah, a bit.

1068
01:38:30,336 --> 01:38:31,671
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1069
01:38:31,671 --> 01:38:34,333
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1070
01:38:35,574 --> 01:38:37,677
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1071
01:38:37,677 --> 01:38:39,702
I finished last, Hermione.

1072
01:38:40,546 --> 01:38:44,850
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1073
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:48,254
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1074
01:38:48,254 --> 01:38:51,155
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1075
01:38:53,492 --> 01:38:56,562
Attention!

1076
01:38:56,562 --> 01:39:00,866
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1077
01:39:00,866 --> 01:39:04,537
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1078
01:39:04,537 --> 01:39:07,373
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1079
01:39:07,373 --> 01:39:12,511
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1080
01:39:12,511 --> 01:39:16,949
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1081
01:39:16,949 --> 01:39:19,118
...second place...

1082
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:20,786
- Second place!
- Well done!

1083
01:39:20,786 --> 01:39:23,414
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1084
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:26,214
Yes!

1085
01:39:29,729 --> 01:39:31,697
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1086
01:39:31,697 --> 01:39:33,499
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1087
01:39:33,499 --> 01:39:36,035
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1088
01:39:36,035 --> 01:39:38,871
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1089
01:39:38,871 --> 01:39:40,706
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1090
01:39:40,706 --> 01:39:42,408
Well done, boy.

1091
01:39:42,408 --> 01:39:45,811
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1092
01:39:45,811 --> 01:39:49,804
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1093
01:39:50,816 --> 01:39:54,453
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1094
01:39:54,453 --> 01:39:56,444
...to lose one's family.

1095
01:39:58,457 --> 01:40:00,618
Never whole again, are we?

1096
01:40:02,862 --> 01:40:04,955
Still, life goes on...

1097
01:40:05,631 --> 01:40:07,292
...and here we stand.

1098
01:40:10,169 --> 01:40:13,072
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1099
01:40:13,072 --> 01:40:14,707
Bartemius!

1100
01:40:14,707 --> 01:40:19,011
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1101
01:40:19,011 --> 01:40:22,208
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1102
01:40:34,693 --> 01:40:36,593
And they say I'm mad.

1103
01:40:45,871 --> 01:40:49,775
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1104
01:40:49,775 --> 01:40:52,801
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1105
01:40:53,312 --> 01:40:56,048
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1106
01:40:56,048 --> 01:41:00,252
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1107
01:41:00,252 --> 01:41:03,756
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1108
01:41:03,756 --> 01:41:05,491
And Harry, of course.

1109
01:41:05,491 --> 01:41:11,063
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1110
01:41:11,063 --> 01:41:13,088
Hooray!

1111
01:41:14,533 --> 01:41:17,203
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1112
01:41:17,203 --> 01:41:19,831
Teach us something, please

1113
01:41:29,815 --> 01:41:31,305
Mr. Crouch?

1114
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:42,161
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1115
01:41:42,161 --> 01:41:43,896
I will not.

1116
01:41:43,896 --> 01:41:48,134
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1117
01:41:48,134 --> 01:41:49,635
Then for once show them some!

1118
01:41:49,635 --> 01:41:53,906
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1119
01:41:53,906 --> 01:41:57,276
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1120
01:41:57,276 --> 01:42:00,246
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1121
01:42:00,246 --> 01:42:03,909
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1122
01:42:08,254 --> 01:42:09,989
Oh, Harry!

1123
01:42:09,989 --> 01:42:12,287
Harry, how good to see you again.

1124
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:14,827
I can come back later, professor.

1125
01:42:14,827 --> 01:42:18,330
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. L'll be back in a moment.

1126
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:20,890
Minister, after you.

1127
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:23,602
There you are. Your hat.

1128
01:42:23,602 --> 01:42:27,439
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1129
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:30,670
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1130
01:44:02,101 --> 01:44:03,869
Professor?

1131
01:44:03,869 --> 01:44:06,394
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1132
01:44:17,316 --> 01:44:21,253
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1133
01:44:21,253 --> 01:44:23,355
...to present evidence to this council.

1134
01:44:23,355 --> 01:44:26,225
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1135
01:44:26,225 --> 01:44:30,462
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1136
01:44:30,462 --> 01:44:35,234
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1137
01:44:35,234 --> 01:44:36,929
Do you accept these terms?

1138
01:44:37,503 --> 01:44:40,539
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1139
01:44:40,539 --> 01:44:43,007
I have names, sir.

1140
01:44:43,542 --> 01:44:47,137
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1141
01:44:49,815 --> 01:44:52,518
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1142
01:44:52,518 --> 01:44:54,820
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1143
01:44:54,820 --> 01:44:57,623
- Lf that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1144
01:44:57,623 --> 01:45:01,093
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1145
01:45:01,093 --> 01:45:03,629
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1146
01:45:03,629 --> 01:45:04,997
Yeah, the same.

1147
01:45:04,997 --> 01:45:08,660
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1148
01:45:09,902 --> 01:45:13,339
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1149
01:45:13,339 --> 01:45:15,474
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1150
01:45:15,474 --> 01:45:20,379
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1151
01:45:20,379 --> 01:45:23,515
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1152
01:45:23,515 --> 01:45:27,653
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1153
01:45:27,653 --> 01:45:30,823
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1154
01:45:30,823 --> 01:45:34,426
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1155
01:45:34,426 --> 01:45:36,724
Silence!

1156
01:45:37,329 --> 01:45:40,933
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1157
01:45:40,933 --> 01:45:43,235
...this session is now concluded.

1158
01:45:43,235 --> 01:45:45,328
Oh, no, no, no.

1159
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:47,873
I've heard about one more.

1160
01:45:47,873 --> 01:45:50,609
- What's that?
- The name.

1161
01:45:50,609 --> 01:45:52,244
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1162
01:45:52,244 --> 01:45:54,446
...this person took part
in the capture...

1163
01:45:54,446 --> 01:45:56,782
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1164
01:45:56,782 --> 01:46:00,452
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1165
01:46:00,452 --> 01:46:02,955
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1166
01:46:02,955 --> 01:46:05,480
Barty Crouch...

1167
01:46:08,193 --> 01:46:09,217
...Junior.

1168
01:46:18,704 --> 01:46:20,399
Hold him down!

1169
01:46:24,042 --> 01:46:27,671
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1170
01:46:29,381 --> 01:46:30,973
Hello, Father.

1171
01:46:32,384 --> 01:46:34,443
You are no son of mine.

1172
01:46:45,764 --> 01:46:50,224
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1173
01:46:51,603 --> 01:46:53,172
It's a Pensieve.

1174
01:46:53,172 --> 01:46:58,010
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1175
01:46:58,010 --> 01:47:02,014
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1176
01:47:02,014 --> 01:47:05,150
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1177
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:06,708
...some small detail...

1178
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:10,422
...something I might have overlooked...

1179
01:47:10,422 --> 01:47:14,620
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1180
01:47:15,427 --> 01:47:19,295
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1181
01:47:20,365 --> 01:47:21,957
It's maddening.

1182
01:47:24,303 --> 01:47:26,066
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1183
01:47:26,839 --> 01:47:29,074
What exactly happened to him?

1184
01:47:29,074 --> 01:47:33,875
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1185
01:47:34,546 --> 01:47:38,141
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1186
01:47:39,618 --> 01:47:42,610
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1187
01:47:43,355 --> 01:47:45,448
I had a dream about him.

1188
01:47:47,726 --> 01:47:50,524
It was in the summer, before school.

1189
01:47:52,664 --> 01:47:55,868
In the dream, I was in a house.

1190
01:47:55,868 --> 01:48:00,806
And voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1191
01:48:00,806 --> 01:48:04,810
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1192
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:07,643
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1193
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,107
Always the same one.

1194
01:48:13,151 --> 01:48:15,654
Sir, these dreams...

1195
01:48:15,654 --> 01:48:20,853
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1196
01:48:22,494 --> 01:48:25,463
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1197
01:48:25,964 --> 01:48:27,932
I think it's best if you simply...

1198
01:48:33,572 --> 01:48:35,335
...cast them away.

1199
01:48:44,616 --> 01:48:48,575
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1200
01:48:57,296 --> 01:48:58,664
Potter!

1201
01:48:58,664 --> 01:49:01,189
What's your hurry?

1202
01:49:06,305 --> 01:49:10,242
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1203
01:49:10,242 --> 01:49:12,506
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1204
01:49:13,278 --> 01:49:14,802
Yes, sir.

1205
01:49:15,747 --> 01:49:17,146
Ingenious.

1206
01:49:18,984 --> 01:49:22,943
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1207
01:49:23,755 --> 01:49:27,247
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1208
01:49:28,961 --> 01:49:30,895
Nor is this.

1209
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:36,761
Know what it is?

1210
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:39,503
Bubble juice, sir?

1211
01:49:40,072 --> 01:49:41,972
Veritaserum.

1212
01:49:42,708 --> 01:49:46,578
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1213
01:49:46,578 --> 01:49:51,743
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1214
01:49:52,417 --> 01:49:55,621
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1215
01:49:55,621 --> 01:50:00,659
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1216
01:50:00,659 --> 01:50:05,062
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1217
01:50:06,198 --> 01:50:11,898
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1218
01:50:12,604 --> 01:50:16,108
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1219
01:50:16,108 --> 01:50:18,303
...l'm going to find out why!

1220
01:50:45,137 --> 01:50:46,729
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1221
01:51:05,924 --> 01:51:07,448
Sonorus!

1222
01:51:11,697 --> 01:51:17,202
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1223
01:51:17,202 --> 01:51:22,162
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1224
01:51:24,276 --> 01:51:26,073
...and Mr. Potter...

1225
01:51:27,946 --> 01:51:29,848
...are tied for first position...

1226
01:51:29,848 --> 01:51:33,978
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1227
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:38,678
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1228
01:51:39,558 --> 01:51:42,652
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1229
01:51:46,998 --> 01:51:49,901
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1230
01:51:49,901 --> 01:51:53,004
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1231
01:51:53,004 --> 01:51:57,843
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1232
01:51:57,843 --> 01:52:01,745
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1233
01:52:04,883 --> 01:52:09,387
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1234
01:52:09,387 --> 01:52:12,924
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1235
01:52:12,924 --> 01:52:16,128
You see, people change in the maze.

1236
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,996
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1237
01:52:17,996 --> 01:52:22,763
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1238
01:52:24,236 --> 01:52:27,228
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1239
01:52:36,281 --> 01:52:38,150
Good luck.

1240
01:52:38,150 --> 01:52:40,084
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1241
01:52:42,454 --> 01:52:45,048
On the count of three. One...

1242
01:56:12,831 --> 01:56:14,059
Fleur?

1243
01:56:15,734 --> 01:56:17,167
Fleur.

1244
01:56:20,739 --> 01:56:22,570
Periculum!

1245
01:57:01,246 --> 01:57:02,713
Get down!

1246
01:57:03,281 --> 01:57:05,010
Get down!

1247
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:06,878
Expelliarmus!

1248
01:57:16,494 --> 01:57:19,864
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1249
01:57:19,864 --> 01:57:21,923
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1250
01:57:33,545 --> 01:57:35,240
Yes.

1251
01:57:56,134 --> 01:57:57,897
Harry!

1252
01:58:00,205 --> 01:58:01,866
Harry!

1253
01:58:04,242 --> 01:58:05,675
Harry!

1254
01:58:08,146 --> 01:58:09,704
Harry!

1255
01:58:11,683 --> 01:58:13,480
Reducto!

1256
01:58:30,268 --> 01:58:33,171
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1257
01:58:33,171 --> 01:58:38,042
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1258
01:58:38,042 --> 01:58:39,771
For a moment, so did I.

1259
01:58:41,646 --> 01:58:42,806
Some game, huh?

1260
01:58:43,848 --> 01:58:45,247
Some game.

1261
01:58:50,688 --> 01:58:52,315
Go!

1262
01:59:02,467 --> 01:59:05,670
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1263
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:07,839
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1264
01:59:07,839 --> 01:59:09,067
...three!
...three!

1265
01:59:21,519 --> 01:59:24,454
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1266
01:59:31,529 --> 01:59:32,860
Where are we?

1267
01:59:38,570 --> 01:59:40,197
I've been here before.

1268
01:59:43,841 --> 01:59:45,433
It's a Portkey.

1269
01:59:47,212 --> 01:59:51,478
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1270
01:59:53,551 --> 01:59:57,121
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1271
01:59:57,121 --> 01:59:59,089
What are you talking about?

1272
02:00:04,329 --> 02:00:07,230
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1273
02:00:14,872 --> 02:00:17,375
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1274
02:00:17,375 --> 02:00:20,139
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1275
02:00:31,456 --> 02:00:33,321
Do it! Now!

1276
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:47,939
Bone of the father...

1277
02:00:47,939 --> 02:00:50,237
...unwillingly given.

1278
02:00:57,715 --> 02:01:00,741
Flesh of the servant...

1279
02:01:02,787 --> 02:01:05,950
...willingly sacrificed.

1280
02:01:10,061 --> 02:01:13,792
And blood of the enemy...

1281
02:01:19,604 --> 02:01:22,095
...forcibly taken.

1282
02:01:28,146 --> 02:01:31,115
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1283
02:01:31,883 --> 02:01:33,817
...again.

1284
02:02:37,215 --> 02:02:40,616
My wand, Wormtail.

1285
02:02:50,161 --> 02:02:52,296
Hold out your arm.

1286
02:02:52,296 --> 02:02:54,065
Master.

1287
02:02:54,065 --> 02:02:56,868
Thank you, master.

1288
02:02:56,868 --> 02:02:58,335
The other arm, Wormtail.

1289
02:03:38,976 --> 02:03:40,876
Welcome, my friends.

1290
02:03:42,280 --> 02:03:45,044
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1291
02:03:45,683 --> 02:03:51,178
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1292
02:03:52,123 --> 02:03:55,526
I confess myself...

1293
02:03:55,526 --> 02:03:57,084
...disappointed.

1294
02:03:57,762 --> 02:04:00,031
Not one of you tried to find me.

1295
02:04:00,031 --> 02:04:03,398
Crabbe! Macnair!

1296
02:04:04,302 --> 02:04:05,633
Goyle!

1297
02:04:08,139 --> 02:04:09,766
Not even you...

1298
02:04:13,644 --> 02:04:15,578
...Lucius.

1299
02:04:17,415 --> 02:04:22,420
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1300
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:25,590
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1301
02:04:25,590 --> 02:04:30,755
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1302
02:04:32,463 --> 02:04:38,095
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1303
02:04:40,104 --> 02:04:43,107
...that is my true mask.

1304
02:04:43,107 --> 02:04:44,665
I returned.

1305
02:04:47,144 --> 02:04:51,046
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1306
02:04:52,183 --> 02:04:57,951
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1307
02:05:03,160 --> 02:05:05,492
Thank you, master.

1308
02:05:06,097 --> 02:05:07,826
Thank you.

1309
02:05:10,935 --> 02:05:13,301
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1310
02:05:14,772 --> 02:05:16,440
Harry.

1311
02:05:16,440 --> 02:05:19,410
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1312
02:05:19,410 --> 02:05:23,981
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1313
02:05:23,981 --> 02:05:25,516
I'd introduce you...

1314
02:05:25,516 --> 02:05:29,816
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1315
02:05:32,490 --> 02:05:35,326
The boy who lived.

1316
02:05:35,326 --> 02:05:38,396
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1317
02:05:38,396 --> 02:05:42,567
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1318
02:05:42,567 --> 02:05:47,471
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1319
02:05:47,471 --> 02:05:49,407
Yes, shall I?

1320
02:05:49,407 --> 02:05:50,908
It was love.

1321
02:05:50,908 --> 02:05:55,580
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1322
02:05:55,580 --> 02:05:58,583
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1323
02:05:58,583 --> 02:06:00,380
I could not touch him.

1324
02:06:01,619 --> 02:06:03,921
It was old magic.

1325
02:06:03,921 --> 02:06:06,357
Something I should have foreseen.

1326
02:06:06,357 --> 02:06:08,326
But no matter, no matter.

1327
02:06:08,326 --> 02:06:10,521
Things have changed.

1328
02:06:11,295 --> 02:06:14,787
I can touch you...

1329
02:06:15,399 --> 02:06:17,128
now

1330
02:06:25,276 --> 02:06:26,607
Yeah.

1331
02:06:32,950 --> 02:06:36,647
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1332
02:06:37,788 --> 02:06:39,517
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1333
02:06:41,125 --> 02:06:43,355
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1334
02:06:44,929 --> 02:06:47,431
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1335
02:06:47,431 --> 02:06:50,034
First, we bow to each other.

1336
02:06:50,034 --> 02:06:52,570
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1337
02:06:52,570 --> 02:06:55,973
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1338
02:06:55,973 --> 02:06:57,304
I said, bow.

1339
02:06:59,176 --> 02:07:03,914
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1340
02:07:03,914 --> 02:07:05,779
Crucio!

1341
02:07:08,252 --> 02:07:09,981
Crucio!

1342
02:07:11,055 --> 02:07:13,157
Attaboy, Harry.

1343
02:07:13,157 --> 02:07:15,593
Your parents would be proud.

1344
02:07:15,593 --> 02:07:19,163
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1345
02:07:19,163 --> 02:07:20,755
Expelliar...

1346
02:07:23,768 --> 02:07:26,337
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1347
02:07:26,337 --> 02:07:28,328
I'm going to destroy you.

1348
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:36,104
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1349
02:07:36,747 --> 02:07:39,483
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1350
02:07:39,483 --> 02:07:42,453
...they'll speak only of how you...

1351
02:07:42,453 --> 02:07:44,455
...begged for death.

1352
02:07:44,455 --> 02:07:48,221
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1353
02:07:48,759 --> 02:07:50,695
...obliged.

1354
02:07:50,695 --> 02:07:52,185
Get up!

1355
02:07:57,201 --> 02:07:59,336
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1356
02:07:59,336 --> 02:08:01,772
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1357
02:08:01,772 --> 02:08:04,969
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1358
02:08:18,923 --> 02:08:20,652
Have it your way.

1359
02:08:21,692 --> 02:08:24,092
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1360
02:08:41,612 --> 02:08:44,274
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1361
02:08:48,853 --> 02:08:50,548
He's mine!

1362
02:09:23,621 --> 02:09:27,792
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1363
02:09:27,792 --> 02:09:30,027
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1364
02:09:30,027 --> 02:09:31,790
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1365
02:09:32,997 --> 02:09:36,200
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1366
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:38,725
Take my body back to my father.

1367
02:09:39,770 --> 02:09:41,572
Let go.

1368
02:09:41,572 --> 02:09:43,540
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1369
02:09:44,375 --> 02:09:47,003
Let go! Let go!

1370
02:09:52,750 --> 02:09:54,115
Accio!

1371
02:09:59,824 --> 02:10:01,815
No!

1372
02:10:14,572 --> 02:10:16,164
He did it!

1373
02:10:17,408 --> 02:10:19,069
Harry!

1374
02:10:21,846 --> 02:10:23,336
Harry!

1375
02:10:24,548 --> 02:10:28,085
No! No! No, don't!

1376
02:10:28,085 --> 02:10:30,254
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1377
02:10:30,254 --> 02:10:32,990
He's back. He's back.

1378
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:35,192
Voldemort's back.

1379
02:10:35,192 --> 02:10:37,761
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1380
02:10:37,761 --> 02:10:40,264
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1381
02:10:40,264 --> 02:10:43,234
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1382
02:10:43,234 --> 02:10:45,703
He's home. You both are.

1383
02:10:45,703 --> 02:10:49,332
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1384
02:10:52,409 --> 02:10:56,347
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1385
02:10:56,347 --> 02:10:58,215
Let me through.

1386
02:10:58,215 --> 02:10:59,739
Let me through!

1387
02:11:01,652 --> 02:11:03,087
Let me through!

1388
02:11:03,087 --> 02:11:04,486
That's my son!

1389
02:11:05,789 --> 02:11:07,222
That's my boy!

1390
02:11:10,060 --> 02:11:12,790
Lt's my boy!

1391
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:19,336
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1392
02:11:19,336 --> 02:11:22,305
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1393
02:11:22,973 --> 02:11:25,168
No!

1394
02:11:28,245 --> 02:11:30,814
Lt's all right, I got you.

1395
02:11:30,814 --> 02:11:34,147
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1396
02:11:38,155 --> 02:11:39,952
No!

1397
02:11:41,058 --> 02:11:42,923
No!

1398
02:12:25,336 --> 02:12:27,031
Are you all right, Potter?

1399
02:12:27,604 --> 02:12:29,707
Does it hurt? That?

1400
02:12:29,707 --> 02:12:31,504
Not so much now.

1401
02:12:32,443 --> 02:12:34,536
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1402
02:12:37,681 --> 02:12:39,672
The cup was a Portkey.

1403
02:12:42,386 --> 02:12:44,488
Someone had bewitched it.

1404
02:12:44,488 --> 02:12:46,924
What was it like?

1405
02:12:46,924 --> 02:12:48,759
- What was he like?
- Who?

1406
02:12:48,759 --> 02:12:50,522
The Dark Lord.

1407
02:12:52,830 --> 02:12:55,924
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1408
02:12:57,201 --> 02:12:58,998
I don't know.

1409
02:13:01,839 --> 02:13:04,774
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1410
02:13:07,745 --> 02:13:09,736
...into one of my nightmares.

1411
02:13:28,465 --> 02:13:30,200
Were there others?

1412
02:13:30,200 --> 02:13:32,464
In the graveyard, were there others?

1413
02:13:36,407 --> 02:13:37,806
I...

1414
02:13:38,509 --> 02:13:42,445
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1415
02:13:49,887 --> 02:13:53,152
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1416
02:13:57,561 --> 02:14:00,798
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1417
02:14:00,798 --> 02:14:02,698
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1418
02:14:06,236 --> 02:14:10,107
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1419
02:14:10,107 --> 02:14:12,598
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1420
02:14:14,211 --> 02:14:17,047
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1421
02:14:17,047 --> 02:14:20,417
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1422
02:14:20,417 --> 02:14:21,975
...that led him straight to it?

1423
02:14:30,394 --> 02:14:34,387
Lt was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1424
02:14:34,965 --> 02:14:38,769
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1425
02:14:38,769 --> 02:14:40,930
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1426
02:14:41,572 --> 02:14:45,242
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1427
02:14:45,242 --> 02:14:46,539
And now the deed is done.

1428
02:14:48,212 --> 02:14:52,546
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1429
02:15:01,058 --> 02:15:04,550
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1430
02:15:05,496 --> 02:15:07,987
...that I have once and for all...

1431
02:15:08,599 --> 02:15:13,103
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1432
02:15:13,103 --> 02:15:14,365
Expelliarmus!

1433
02:15:19,076 --> 02:15:20,338
Severus.

1434
02:15:22,813 --> 02:15:24,303
That's it, take it.

1435
02:15:26,283 --> 02:15:29,920
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1436
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:32,789
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1437
02:15:32,789 --> 02:15:35,883
Is he in this room? Ls he in this room?

1438
02:15:38,929 --> 02:15:40,453
Harry, away from there!

1439
02:16:01,451 --> 02:16:04,784
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1440
02:16:05,756 --> 02:16:07,815
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1441
02:16:09,626 --> 02:16:10,894
Polyjuice Potion.

1442
02:16:10,894 --> 02:16:14,364
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1443
02:16:14,364 --> 02:16:16,298
We'll get you up in a minute.

1444
02:16:50,734 --> 02:16:52,133
Harry!

1445
02:16:55,806 --> 02:16:58,242
Barty Crouch Junior.

1446
02:16:58,242 --> 02:17:01,177
L'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1447
02:17:03,547 --> 02:17:04,741
Your arm, Harry.

1448
02:17:09,119 --> 02:17:11,349
You know what this means, don't you?

1449
02:17:12,256 --> 02:17:13,587
He's back.

1450
02:17:14,791 --> 02:17:16,918
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1451
02:17:17,861 --> 02:17:20,397
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1452
02:17:20,397 --> 02:17:25,402
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1453
02:17:25,402 --> 02:17:27,893
- L'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1454
02:17:28,472 --> 02:17:31,339
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1455
02:17:51,228 --> 02:17:53,890
Today, we acknowledge...

1456
02:17:54,598 --> 02:17:57,362
...a really terrible loss.

1457
02:17:59,469 --> 02:18:02,406
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1458
02:18:02,406 --> 02:18:04,738
...exceptionally hard-working...

1459
02:18:05,642 --> 02:18:08,008
...infinitely fair-minded...

1460
02:18:08,578 --> 02:18:11,181
...and, most importantly...

1461
02:18:11,181 --> 02:18:15,743
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1462
02:18:16,887 --> 02:18:21,256
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1463
02:18:24,294 --> 02:18:25,818
You see...

1464
02:18:26,663 --> 02:18:28,756
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1465
02:18:29,666 --> 02:18:31,657
...by Lord Voldemort!

1466
02:18:33,570 --> 02:18:37,131
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1467
02:18:37,774 --> 02:18:41,471
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1468
02:18:43,647 --> 02:18:45,482
Now, the pain...

1469
02:18:45,482 --> 02:18:49,319
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1470
02:18:49,319 --> 02:18:50,821
...and reminds us...

1471
02:18:50,821 --> 02:18:54,691
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1472
02:18:54,691 --> 02:18:58,127
...our hearts beat as one.

1473
02:18:58,628 --> 02:19:00,997
In light of recent events...

1474
02:19:00,997 --> 02:19:05,934
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1475
02:19:06,803 --> 02:19:12,576
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1476
02:19:12,576 --> 02:19:14,703
You remember that...

1477
02:19:15,312 --> 02:19:18,338
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1478
02:19:18,882 --> 02:19:21,350
...kind and honest...

1479
02:19:21,852 --> 02:19:26,448
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1480
02:19:51,681 --> 02:19:53,706
I never liked these curtains.

1481
02:19:54,317 --> 02:19:57,320
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1482
02:19:57,320 --> 02:19:59,151
By accident, of course.

1483
02:20:04,828 --> 02:20:09,197
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1484
02:20:12,602 --> 02:20:14,504
Professor...

1485
02:20:14,504 --> 02:20:17,496
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1486
02:20:18,308 --> 02:20:22,711
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1487
02:20:24,281 --> 02:20:26,613
Priori Incantatem.

1488
02:20:30,754 --> 02:20:33,484
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1489
02:20:34,057 --> 02:20:35,888
They reappeared.

1490
02:20:37,360 --> 02:20:41,126
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1491
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:46,770
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1492
02:20:46,770 --> 02:20:51,605
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1493
02:20:54,978 --> 02:20:56,813
But remember this:

1494
02:20:56,813 --> 02:20:58,747
You have friends here.

1495
02:21:00,750 --> 02:21:02,513
You're not alone.

1496
02:21:23,206 --> 02:21:25,342
Hermione.

1497
02:21:25,342 --> 02:21:27,333
This is for you.

1498
02:21:27,944 --> 02:21:30,139
Write to me. Promise.

1499
02:21:31,248 --> 02:21:32,647
Bye.

1500
02:21:38,889 --> 02:21:40,823
Au revoir, Ron.

1501
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:27,470
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1502
02:22:27,470 --> 02:22:28,772
- No.
- No.

1503
02:22:28,772 --> 02:22:33,141
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1504
02:22:37,547 --> 02:22:40,380
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1505
02:22:47,691 --> 02:22:49,158
Yes.

1506
02:22:53,897 --> 02:22:57,367
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1507
02:22:57,367 --> 02:22:59,927
I won't. You know I won't.

1508
02:23:01,204 --> 02:23:04,970
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
