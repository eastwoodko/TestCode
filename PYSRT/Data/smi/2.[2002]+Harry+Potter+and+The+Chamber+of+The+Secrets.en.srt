1
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:15,628
l can't let you out, Hedwig.

2
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:19,666
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:23,534
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon--
- Harry Potter!

4
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:26,997
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:31,845 --> 00:01:34,541
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:36,883 --> 00:01:40,649
I'm warning you, if you can't control
that bloody bird, it'll have to go.

7
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:42,789
But she's bored.

8
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:47,460
lf l could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,598
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No, sir.

10
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:56,936
But l haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:59,005
Not one...

12
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,573
...all summer.

13
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:03,804
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,681
l should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:12,352
We've raised you since you were a baby,
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,654
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:17,624
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:17,624 --> 00:02:23,392
- Not now. It's for when the Masons arrive.
- Which should be any minute.

19
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,033
Now, let's go over our schedule
once again, shall we?

20
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:29,135
Petunia, when the Masons arrive,
you will be...?

21
00:02:29,135 --> 00:02:33,006
In the lounge, waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

22
00:02:33,006 --> 00:02:37,143
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.

23
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:39,043
Excellent.

24
00:02:43,616 --> 00:02:45,447
And you?

25
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,557
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise
and pretending that l don't exist.

26
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:52,458
Too right, you will.

27
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:56,129
With any luck, this could be the day
l make the biggest deal of my career...

28
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:59,656
...and you will not mess it up.

29
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:15,612
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.

30
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:23,387
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.

31
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:25,658
Not to be rude or anything...

32
00:03:25,658 --> 00:03:29,796
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

33
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:32,465
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.

34
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:35,735
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you...

35
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:40,773
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

36
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:46,575
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?

37
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:54,520
Dobby, I'm sorry. l didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

38
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,856
Offend Dobby?

39
00:03:56,856 --> 00:03:59,359
Dobby has heard
of your greatness, sir...

40
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:05,059
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.

41
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:08,801
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

42
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:11,404
No, l haven't.

43
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:14,168
That was an awful thing to say.

44
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:18,444
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.

45
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:19,809
Dobby, please, stop.

46
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:26,945
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

47
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:33,593
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.

48
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:35,891
Are you all right?

49
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:39,666
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.

50
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:43,102
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family, sir.

51
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:47,206
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.

52
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:50,376
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

53
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,936
lf they ever knew Dobby was here...

54
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,453
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

55
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,922
Harry Potter must not go back...

56
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:07,794
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

57
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:13,132
There is a plot, a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

58
00:05:13,132 --> 00:05:16,499
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

59
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,306
Can't say.

60
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:25,972
- Okay, l understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. l--

61
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:30,883
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.

62
00:05:30,883 --> 00:05:34,944
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole...

63
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:40,117
Give me the lamp.

64
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:44,228
Dobby, stop!

65
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:49,602
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.

66
00:05:49,602 --> 00:05:53,840
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- l was just--

67
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,536
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

68
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:58,575
Sorry.

69
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,317
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born, boy.

70
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:08,117
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.

71
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,191
See why I've got to go back?

72
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:16,129
l don't belong here.
l belong in your world, at Hogwarts.

73
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,933
- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

74
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:24,003
Well, l expect they've been...

75
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:29,142
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

76
00:06:29,142 --> 00:06:32,412
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Dobby.

77
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:36,783
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

78
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:40,446
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school, sir.

79
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:46,054
- Give me those. Now.
- No!

80
00:06:58,404 --> 00:07:01,635
Dobby, get back here.

81
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:08,281
Dobby, please, no.

82
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:12,819
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

83
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:15,253
l can't. Hogwarts is my home.

84
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:21,694
Then Dobby must do it, sir,
for Harry Potter's own good.

85
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:26,899
It spread as far as the eye could see,
all over the floor of this building.

86
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:29,001
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water."

87
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:31,993
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it."

88
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:48,020
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

89
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,389
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why l kept him upstairs.

90
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,706
You're never going back to that school.

91
00:08:06,706 --> 00:08:11,700
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

92
00:08:57,957 --> 00:08:59,049
Hiya, Harry.

93
00:09:00,092 --> 00:09:04,697
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

94
00:09:04,697 --> 00:09:08,599
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.

95
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,476
You better stand back.

96
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:19,569
Let's go.

97
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,284
- What was that?
- What was it?

98
00:09:28,554 --> 00:09:30,923
Potter!

99
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:32,584
Dad, what's going on?

100
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:37,063
Go. Go. Go.

101
00:09:37,063 --> 00:09:38,087
Dad, hurry up.

102
00:09:39,932 --> 00:09:42,162
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.

103
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,933
Petunia, he's escaping!

104
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:50,142
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!

105
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:52,144
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!

106
00:09:52,144 --> 00:09:55,314
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

107
00:09:55,314 --> 00:09:57,116
- Get off!
- Drive!

108
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:59,151
- Right.
- Right!

109
00:09:59,151 --> 00:10:00,812
No! No! No! No!

110
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:06,987
Dad!

111
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:17,625
Damn.

112
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:25,675
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.

113
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:53,835
Come on.

114
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,442
Okay, come on.

115
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,439
Okay, come on.

116
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:13,716
- Think it'd be all right if we had some?
- Yeah, Mum will never know.

117
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:33,846
It's not much, but it's home.

118
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:36,110
l think it's brilliant.

119
00:11:36,882 --> 00:11:41,053
Where have you been?

120
00:11:41,053 --> 00:11:44,256
Harry, how wonderful
to see you, dear.

121
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:48,027
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

122
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:51,019
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

123
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:54,400
Of course, l don't
blame you, Harry, dear.

124
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,636
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.

125
00:11:57,636 --> 00:12:02,508
Well, you best hope l don't put bars
on your window, Ronald Weasley.

126
00:12:02,508 --> 00:12:04,601
Come on, Harry,
time for a spot of breakfast.

127
00:12:05,778 --> 00:12:08,714
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.

128
00:12:08,714 --> 00:12:12,785
That's it. There we go.

129
00:12:12,785 --> 00:12:16,312
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.

130
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:18,550
Hello.

131
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:24,430
What did l do?

132
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:29,235
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying, really.

133
00:12:29,235 --> 00:12:31,795
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.

134
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:37,009
- What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
- Raids?

135
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:41,046
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic,
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

136
00:12:41,046 --> 00:12:44,350
Dad loves Muggles,
thinks they're fascinating.

137
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,580
Well, now.

138
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:49,715
And who are you?

139
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:54,460
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.

140
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,327
Good Lord. Are you really?

141
00:12:57,897 --> 00:13:02,368
Well, Ron has told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

142
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:04,270
This morning.

143
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:09,408
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

144
00:13:09,408 --> 00:13:13,012
Did you really? How did it go?

145
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:17,847
l mean--  That was very wrong
indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.

146
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:23,222
Now, Harry, you must know
all about Muggles.

147
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:27,318
Tell me, what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

148
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:34,627
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.

149
00:13:40,406 --> 00:13:43,542
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?

150
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:46,773
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.

151
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:52,551
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

152
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:55,788
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.

153
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:57,890
- No.
- This lot won't come cheap.

154
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,156
- The spell books alone are very expensive.
- We'll manage.

155
00:14:02,895 --> 00:14:07,161
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

156
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,969
Right.

157
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,238
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.

158
00:14:12,238 --> 00:14:15,407
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before, Mum.

159
00:14:15,407 --> 00:14:16,609
Floo powder?

160
00:14:16,609 --> 00:14:20,875
You go first, Ron, so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

161
00:14:21,513 --> 00:14:23,378
In you go.

162
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:25,439
That's it.

163
00:14:28,954 --> 00:14:30,649
Diagon Alley.

164
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:40,187
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

165
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:43,335
Come on.

166
00:14:43,335 --> 00:14:46,739
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.

167
00:14:46,739 --> 00:14:50,140
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.

168
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,313
That's it, very good.

169
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:58,682
Now, don't forget to speak
very, very clearly.

170
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,819
Diagonally.

171
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:11,864
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.

172
00:15:11,864 --> 00:15:12,922
l thought he did.

173
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:44,456
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. l was just going...

174
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:48,950
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

175
00:16:49,495 --> 00:16:51,997
- No. Please--
- Harry?

176
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:53,232
Hagrid!

177
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:56,258
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

178
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:07,446
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

179
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:11,617
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

180
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:14,019
l was lost, l--

181
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:17,156
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

182
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:22,461
Me? l was... l was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

183
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:25,362
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

184
00:17:30,803 --> 00:17:33,205
Harry. Hagrid.

185
00:17:33,205 --> 00:17:34,973
Hello, Hermione.

186
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:37,601
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.

187
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:41,046
What did you do to your glasses?

188
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:43,913
Oculus Reparo,

189
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:50,289
l definitely need to remember that one.

190
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:54,193
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

191
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,928
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

192
00:17:55,928 --> 00:17:57,793
Come on, everyone's been so worried.

193
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:09,775
Harry.

194
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:13,178
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

195
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:16,181
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

196
00:18:16,181 --> 00:18:18,445
Here he is.

197
00:18:22,454 --> 00:18:24,256
Mum fancies him.

198
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:27,693
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.

199
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:31,129
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

200
00:18:35,334 --> 00:18:38,201
It can't be. Harry Potter?

201
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:41,807
Harry Potter!

202
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:42,967
Excuse me, madam.

203
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,047
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and l rate the front page.

204
00:18:49,047 --> 00:18:52,618
Ladies and gentlemen,
what an extraordinary moment this is.

205
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:55,954
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

206
00:18:55,954 --> 00:19:00,015
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...

207
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:06,565
...which, incidentally,
is currently celebrating...

208
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:11,570
...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

209
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:16,030
...he had no idea that he would,
in fact, be leaving...

210
00:19:17,242 --> 00:19:22,145
...with my entire collected works...

211
00:19:22,748 --> 00:19:24,943
...free of charge.

212
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:29,621
Now, ladies?

213
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:32,925
Harry, now you give me those,
and I'll get them signed.

214
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:36,417
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

215
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:48,440
I'll bet you loved that,
didn't you, Potter?

216
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,900
Famous Harry Potter. Can't even go into
a bookshop without making the front page.

217
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,447
Leave him alone.

218
00:19:55,447 --> 00:19:59,117
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

219
00:19:59,117 --> 00:20:03,555
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.

220
00:20:03,555 --> 00:20:04,783
Mr. Potter.

221
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:11,363
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

222
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:13,558
Forgive me.

223
00:20:14,967 --> 00:20:16,992
Your scar is legend.

224
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:20,172
As, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.

225
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:22,265
Voldemort killed my parents.

226
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:27,845
He was nothing more than a murderer.

227
00:20:28,914 --> 00:20:31,849
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

228
00:20:32,517 --> 00:20:34,253
Or very foolish.

229
00:20:34,253 --> 00:20:37,780
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

230
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:42,656
And you must be Miss Granger.

231
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:49,796
Yes, Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

232
00:20:54,473 --> 00:20:57,909
Muggles, aren't they?

233
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:05,909
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...

234
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:11,023
...tatty, secondhand book.

235
00:21:11,023 --> 00:21:14,660
You must be the Weasleys.

236
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,862
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

237
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:20,732
- Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
- Lucius.

238
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:25,604
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur,
all those extra raids?

239
00:21:25,604 --> 00:21:28,106
l do hope they're paying you overtime...

240
00:21:28,106 --> 00:21:31,234
...but judging by the state of this,
l'd say not.

241
00:21:33,078 --> 00:21:36,982
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

242
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:39,351
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

243
00:21:39,351 --> 00:21:44,623
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.

244
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:46,420
Clearly.

245
00:21:48,493 --> 00:21:52,190
Associating with Muggles.

246
00:21:56,435 --> 00:22:00,929
And l thought your family
could sink no lower.

247
00:22:04,276 --> 00:22:07,074
I'll see you at work.

248
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:13,582
See you at school.

249
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:24,262
- 10:58. Come on.
- The train will be leaving any moment.

250
00:22:24,262 --> 00:22:27,527
Fred, George, Percy, you first.

251
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:34,763
Okay.

252
00:22:40,846 --> 00:22:42,575
After you, dear.

253
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,981
Come on, Ginny,
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

254
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:51,347
Let's go.

255
00:23:05,203 --> 00:23:08,840
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.

256
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,809
Lost control of the trolley.

257
00:23:13,178 --> 00:23:15,680
- Why can't we get through?
- l don't know.

258
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,047
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

259
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:24,523
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.

260
00:23:24,523 --> 00:23:28,193
Harry, if we can't get through...

261
00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:30,855
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

262
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,266
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

263
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:37,665
The car.

264
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:51,550
Ron, l should tell you...

265
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,487
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

266
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:56,922
Right.

267
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:57,911
Okay.

268
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:18,944
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

269
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:22,247
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

270
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:23,509
Okay.

271
00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,661
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

272
00:24:36,661 --> 00:24:38,322
We can't be far behind.

273
00:24:40,332 --> 00:24:43,435
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.

274
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:45,596
Hold on.

275
00:25:11,897 --> 00:25:14,024
Harry!

276
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,498
Hold on!

277
00:25:21,873 --> 00:25:24,341
Take my hand!

278
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:30,048
Hold on!

279
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:33,643
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

280
00:25:46,231 --> 00:25:49,530
- l think we found the train.
- Yeah.

281
00:26:06,184 --> 00:26:07,412
Welcome home.

282
00:26:23,602 --> 00:26:24,796
Up! Up!

283
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,897
It's not working!

284
00:26:31,876 --> 00:26:34,401
Up! Ron, mind that tree!

285
00:26:37,716 --> 00:26:39,843
Stop! Stop! Stop!

286
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:07,537
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.

287
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,149
- What's happening?
- l don't know.

288
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:49,779
Come on, go! Fast!

289
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:26,920
Scabbers, you're okay.

290
00:28:28,426 --> 00:28:30,451
The car!

291
00:28:45,944 --> 00:28:47,775
Dad's gonna kill me.

292
00:28:56,354 --> 00:28:58,686
See you, Hedwig.

293
00:29:00,024 --> 00:29:02,460
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

294
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:05,597
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 9 3/4...

295
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:09,000
...we almost get killed by a tree...

296
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,527
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

297
00:29:16,174 --> 00:29:19,277
Well, take a good look, lads.

298
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:23,213
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

299
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:29,788
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.

300
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:36,427
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

301
00:29:36,427 --> 00:29:39,191
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

302
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:43,732
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

303
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:47,539
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

304
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:50,633
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

305
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:54,879
Honestly, Professor Snape,
l think it did more damage to us.

306
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:56,039
Silence.

307
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:04,589
l assure you that were you in Slytherin,
and your fate rested with me...

308
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:08,355
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

309
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:11,791
- As it is--
- They are not.

310
00:30:13,998 --> 00:30:18,436
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

311
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:20,138
Headmaster...

312
00:30:20,138 --> 00:30:25,109
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

313
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:29,180
- As such--
- l am well aware of our bylaws, Severus...

314
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,417
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

315
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:35,820
However, as head of Gryffindor house...

316
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:41,292
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

317
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,628
We'll go and get our stuff, then.

318
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:46,231
What are you
talking about, Mr. Weasley?

319
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:48,426
You're going to expel us, aren't you?

320
00:30:50,034 --> 00:30:53,338
Not today, Mr. Weasley...

321
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:58,298
...but l must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

322
00:30:58,877 --> 00:31:03,439
l will be writing to your families tonight,
and you will both receive detention.

323
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,307
Morning, everyone.

324
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:33,711
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.

325
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:38,182
Welcome to Greenhouse Three,
second years. Gather around, everyone.

326
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:41,152
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

327
00:31:41,152 --> 00:31:45,323
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

328
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:47,358
Yes, Miss Granger?

329
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:49,827
Mandrake, or Mandragora...

330
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:55,033
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

331
00:31:55,033 --> 00:32:00,171
It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

332
00:32:00,171 --> 00:32:03,174
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

333
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:06,010
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

334
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,079
...their cries won't kill you yet.

335
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,050
But they could knock you out for several hours,
which is why l have given you earmuffs...

336
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,806
...for auditory protection.

337
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:18,323
So could you please put them on,
right away? Quickly.

338
00:32:18,323 --> 00:32:21,292
Flaps tight down,
and watch me closely.

339
00:32:21,292 --> 00:32:24,462
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

340
00:32:24,462 --> 00:32:27,454
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

341
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:33,871
Got it? And...

342
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:36,174
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

343
00:32:36,174 --> 00:32:40,873
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

344
00:32:44,515 --> 00:32:48,152
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

345
00:32:48,152 --> 00:32:52,590
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.

346
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:56,294
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

347
00:32:56,294 --> 00:32:59,855
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

348
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:18,716
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.

349
00:33:18,716 --> 00:33:21,276
Hello, Sir Nicholas.

350
00:33:32,764 --> 00:33:36,029
Say it. I'm doomed.

351
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:38,835
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.

352
00:33:41,072 --> 00:33:43,975
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

353
00:33:43,975 --> 00:33:45,533
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.

354
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,941
Ron, is that your owl?

355
00:34:02,627 --> 00:34:05,289
Bloody bird's a menace.

356
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,202
Oh, no.

357
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:14,638
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

358
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:21,373
Go on, Ron. l ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

359
00:34:28,553 --> 00:34:30,418
Ronald Weasley!

360
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:39,430
How dare you steal that car!
l am absolutely disgusted!

361
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:42,233
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...

362
00:34:42,233 --> 00:34:45,036
...and it's entirely your fault!

363
00:34:45,036 --> 00:34:49,107
lf you put another toe out of line...

364
00:34:49,107 --> 00:34:52,372
...we'll bring you straight home!

365
00:34:53,144 --> 00:34:56,814
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor,

366
00:34:56,814 --> 00:35:00,477
Your father and l are so proud,

367
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:25,376
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

368
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:27,078
Me.

369
00:35:27,078 --> 00:35:29,780
Gilderoy Lockhart...

370
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,251
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...

371
00:35:33,251 --> 00:35:36,754
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

372
00:35:36,754 --> 00:35:39,991
...and five times winner...

373
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:46,264
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

374
00:35:46,264 --> 00:35:47,932
But l don't talk about that.

375
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:52,460
l didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

376
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,377
Now, be warned.

377
00:35:59,377 --> 00:36:01,546
It is my job to arm you...

378
00:36:01,546 --> 00:36:06,848
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

379
00:36:07,718 --> 00:36:11,455
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

380
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:15,660
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst l am here.

381
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,763
l must ask you not to scream.

382
00:36:18,763 --> 00:36:21,323
It might provoke them.

383
00:36:24,802 --> 00:36:26,504
Cornish pixies?

384
00:36:26,504 --> 00:36:29,530
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

385
00:36:30,374 --> 00:36:32,677
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...

386
00:36:32,677 --> 00:36:37,014
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

387
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:39,915
Let's see what you make of them.

388
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:47,520
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.

389
00:37:03,274 --> 00:37:07,370
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!

390
00:37:09,714 --> 00:37:12,182
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!

391
00:37:13,818 --> 00:37:17,015
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!

392
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:41,307
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

393
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,241
What do we do now?

394
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:48,241
lmmobulus!

395
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:00,026
Why is it always me?

396
00:38:06,337 --> 00:38:09,206
l spent the summer devising
a whole new Quidditch program.

397
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:13,044
We're gonna train earlier,
harder and longer.

398
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:16,343
What--? l don't believe it.

399
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:21,986
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.

400
00:38:21,986 --> 00:38:26,389
- l booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.

401
00:38:27,792 --> 00:38:29,987
l smell trouble.

402
00:38:30,594 --> 00:38:34,298
"l, Professor Severus Snape,
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

403
00:38:34,298 --> 00:38:37,968
...permission to practice today, owing
to the need to train their new Seeker."

404
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:40,630
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

405
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:47,445
- Malfoy?
- That's right.

406
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:50,209
And that's not all
that's new this year.

407
00:38:51,048 --> 00:38:54,652
Those are Nimbus 2001s.
How did you get those?

408
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:56,921
A gift from Draco's father.

409
00:38:56,921 --> 00:39:00,758
You see, Weasley, unlike some,
my father can afford the best.

410
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:03,928
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

411
00:39:03,928 --> 00:39:06,863
They got in on pure talent.

412
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:13,935
No one asked your opinion,
you filthy little Mudblood.

413
00:39:16,474 --> 00:39:19,910
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

414
00:39:27,485 --> 00:39:29,350
You okay, Ron?

415
00:39:32,356 --> 00:39:34,153
Say something.

416
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:44,926
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.

417
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:48,072
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

418
00:39:48,072 --> 00:39:50,199
He'll know what to do.

419
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,450
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

420
00:40:06,223 --> 00:40:09,818
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.

421
00:40:10,461 --> 00:40:13,658
- Okay.
- Better out than in.

422
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:19,567
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...

423
00:40:20,805 --> 00:40:24,241
Well, l don't know
exactly what it means.

424
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:30,581
He called me a Mudblood.

425
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:33,617
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?

426
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:38,322
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a really
foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.

427
00:40:38,322 --> 00:40:42,588
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

428
00:40:43,093 --> 00:40:47,223
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

429
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:53,370
See, the thing is, Harry, there are
some wizards, like the Malfoy family...

430
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:58,209
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

431
00:40:58,209 --> 00:40:59,836
That's horrible.

432
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,281
It's disgusting.

433
00:41:04,281 --> 00:41:07,952
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

434
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:11,489
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

435
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:16,227
More to the point, they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

436
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:18,422
Come here.

437
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:25,992
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

438
00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:37,014
Harry, Harry, Harry.

439
00:41:37,014 --> 00:41:39,416
Can you possibly imagine...

440
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:42,647
...a better way to serve detention...

441
00:41:43,287 --> 00:41:46,156
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

442
00:41:46,156 --> 00:41:47,725
Not really.

443
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:54,265
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

444
00:41:54,265 --> 00:41:56,199
Remember that.

445
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:02,273
Come.

446
00:42:02,273 --> 00:42:04,332
Come...

447
00:42:05,643 --> 00:42:08,510
...to me.

448
00:42:11,815 --> 00:42:14,340
- What?
- Sorry?

449
00:42:16,587 --> 00:42:18,722
That voice.

450
00:42:18,722 --> 00:42:20,246
Voice?

451
00:42:23,827 --> 00:42:28,457
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?

452
00:42:29,066 --> 00:42:32,836
l think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

453
00:42:32,836 --> 00:42:37,241
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

454
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:40,608
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

455
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:48,108
Spooky.

456
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:53,457
Blood.

457
00:42:53,457 --> 00:42:57,161
l smell blood.

458
00:42:57,161 --> 00:43:00,364
Let me rip you.

459
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:03,959
Let me kill you.

460
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:07,270
Kill!

461
00:43:08,205 --> 00:43:09,502
Kill!

462
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,343
- Kill!
- Harry!

463
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:14,979
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?

464
00:43:14,979 --> 00:43:18,582
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?

465
00:43:18,582 --> 00:43:22,820
l heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just--

466
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,089
It's time.

467
00:43:25,089 --> 00:43:28,286
It's moving.
l think it's going to kill.

468
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:33,218
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!

469
00:43:58,822 --> 00:44:00,813
Strange.

470
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:05,852
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- l don't like spiders.

471
00:44:09,967 --> 00:44:12,026
What's that?

472
00:44:15,506 --> 00:44:20,210
"The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."

473
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,474
It's written in blood.

474
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:27,577
Oh, no.

475
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:34,553
It's Filch's cat.

476
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:37,356
It's Mrs. Norris.

477
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:56,173
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."

478
00:44:57,681 --> 00:45:00,150
You'll be next, Mudbloods.

479
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,315
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.

480
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,792
Potter?

481
00:45:08,792 --> 00:45:10,919
What are you...?

482
00:45:14,231 --> 00:45:16,529
Mrs. Norris?

483
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:22,639
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.

484
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:23,901
I'll kill you.

485
00:45:26,243 --> 00:45:29,076
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!

486
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:32,608
Argus, l...

487
00:45:34,618 --> 00:45:39,248
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

488
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,958
Everyone except...

489
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,955
...you three.

490
00:45:47,097 --> 00:45:49,861
Ravenclaws, follow me.

491
00:45:51,735 --> 00:45:55,806
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.

492
00:45:55,806 --> 00:45:58,809
Thought so.
So unlucky l wasn't there.

493
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:01,937
l know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

494
00:46:04,281 --> 00:46:07,184
But how she has been Petrified,
l cannot say.

495
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:10,053
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

496
00:46:10,053 --> 00:46:12,923
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

497
00:46:12,923 --> 00:46:17,194
It's not true, sir. l swear.
l never touched Mrs. Norris.

498
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:22,099
- Rubbish.
- lf l might, headmaster?

499
00:46:22,099 --> 00:46:26,900
Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

500
00:46:27,437 --> 00:46:29,673
However...

501
00:46:29,673 --> 00:46:32,810
...the circumstances are suspicious.

502
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:37,614
l, for one, don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

503
00:46:37,614 --> 00:46:40,050
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.

504
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,620
You see, Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

505
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,090
That's why Ron and l
went looking for him, professor.

506
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:49,820
We'd just found him when he said...

507
00:46:52,095 --> 00:46:55,929
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When l said l wasn't hungry.

508
00:46:57,334 --> 00:47:00,214
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

509
00:47:03,765 --> 00:47:09,294
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
- My cat has been Petrified.

510
00:47:10,138 --> 00:47:15,974
- l want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.

511
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:21,850
As l understand it, Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

512
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:26,621
When matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

513
00:47:26,621 --> 00:47:28,316
And in the meantime...

514
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:32,883
...l strongly recommend caution...

515
00:47:33,561 --> 00:47:35,552
...to all.

516
00:47:46,205 --> 00:47:49,808
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?

517
00:47:49,808 --> 00:47:52,745
You hear this voice,
a voice only you can hear...

518
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:57,616
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

519
00:47:57,616 --> 00:48:00,953
Do you think l should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, l mean?

520
00:48:00,953 --> 00:48:02,621
Are you mad?

521
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:08,082
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world,
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

522
00:48:10,229 --> 00:48:12,595
She's right, you know.

523
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:19,267
Could l have your attention,
please?

524
00:48:19,805 --> 00:48:25,477
Right. Now, today,
we will be transforming animals...

525
00:48:25,477 --> 00:48:27,843
...into water goblets.

526
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,616
Like so.

527
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:35,519
One, two, three.
vera verto.

528
00:48:39,091 --> 00:48:42,993
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

529
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:48,533
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. vera verto."

530
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:54,231
vera verto!

531
00:49:00,279 --> 00:49:02,941
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.

532
00:49:04,283 --> 00:49:06,619
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...

533
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:10,817
...l was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

534
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:18,291
Very well.

535
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:21,967
You all know, of course...

536
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:26,005
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

537
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:30,609
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

538
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:34,513
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...

539
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:40,145
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

540
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:47,026
Now, three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

541
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:50,018
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.

542
00:49:50,796 --> 00:49:53,399
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

543
00:49:53,399 --> 00:49:56,736
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

544
00:49:56,736 --> 00:50:01,507
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

545
00:50:01,507 --> 00:50:04,009
In other words, pure-bloods.

546
00:50:04,009 --> 00:50:09,345
Unable to sway the others,
he decided to leave the school.

547
00:50:10,182 --> 00:50:12,585
Now, according to legend...

548
00:50:12,585 --> 00:50:16,489
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

549
00:50:16,489 --> 00:50:20,326
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

550
00:50:20,326 --> 00:50:24,930
Though, shortly before departing,
he sealed it...

551
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:29,235
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

552
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:31,771
The Heir alone...

553
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:34,607
...would be able to open the Chamber...

554
00:50:34,607 --> 00:50:39,545
...and unleash the horror within,
and by so doing...

555
00:50:39,545 --> 00:50:43,082
...purge the school
of all those who...

556
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:48,076
...in Slytherin's view,
were unworthy to study magic.

557
00:50:48,687 --> 00:50:50,814
Muggle-borns.

558
00:50:51,891 --> 00:50:55,694
Naturally, the school
has been searched many times.

559
00:50:55,694 --> 00:50:59,130
No such chamber has been found.

560
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:04,327
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

561
00:51:05,171 --> 00:51:07,940
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

562
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,501
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

563
00:51:12,144 --> 00:51:15,948
It is said to be the home...

564
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,575
...of a monster.

565
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:27,159
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

566
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,564
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

567
00:51:31,564 --> 00:51:35,601
lf there really is a Chamber of Secrets,
and it really has been opened, that means--

568
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:39,705
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?

569
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:44,243
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

570
00:51:44,243 --> 00:51:47,079
- lf you're talking about Malfoy--
- Of course. You heard him.

571
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,981
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."

572
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,750
l heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?

573
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:55,087
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
l mean, look at his family.

574
00:51:55,087 --> 00:51:58,090
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

575
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:01,894
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

576
00:52:01,894 --> 00:52:06,232
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

577
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:08,267
Mind you, it would be difficult.

578
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:11,470
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

579
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:15,930
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

580
00:52:22,748 --> 00:52:25,384
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

581
00:52:25,384 --> 00:52:28,287
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

582
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,725
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another."

583
00:52:32,725 --> 00:52:36,695
You mean if Harry and l drink that stuff,
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

584
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,232
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.

585
00:52:40,232 --> 00:52:44,270
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

586
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:47,740
- How long will it take to make?
- A month.

587
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,375
A month?

588
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:53,379
But, Hermione,
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

589
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:56,749
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

590
00:52:56,749 --> 00:52:58,817
l know.

591
00:52:58,817 --> 00:53:01,581
But it's the only plan we've got.

592
00:53:51,337 --> 00:53:54,033
Another goal for Slytherin!

593
00:53:55,374 --> 00:53:58,775
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

594
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:01,714
Yeah!

595
00:54:01,714 --> 00:54:03,477
Yeah!

596
00:54:27,773 --> 00:54:30,105
All right there, Scarhead?

597
00:54:36,215 --> 00:54:39,118
Watch yourself, Harry!

598
00:54:39,118 --> 00:54:40,881
Wood, look out!

599
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,603
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

600
00:54:57,603 --> 00:54:59,366
That's been tampered with, that has.

601
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,507
I'll stop it.

602
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:06,137
No! Even with a proper wand,
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

603
00:55:31,236 --> 00:55:33,830
Training for the ballet, Potter?

604
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,000
You'll never catch me, Potter.

605
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,064
Let's go.

606
00:57:39,064 --> 00:57:44,297
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch,
Gryffindor wins!

607
00:57:50,609 --> 00:57:52,634
Finite Incantatem!

608
00:57:59,718 --> 00:58:01,186
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

609
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,422
No. l think my arm is broken.

610
00:58:03,422 --> 00:58:07,392
Not to worry, Harry. l will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

611
00:58:07,392 --> 00:58:10,529
- Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

612
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:14,021
This won't hurt a bit.

613
00:58:20,172 --> 00:58:23,164
Brackium Emendo!

614
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:34,486
Yes, well,
that can sometimes happen...

615
00:58:34,486 --> 00:58:36,716
...but the point is...

616
00:58:38,123 --> 00:58:42,427
...you can no longer feel any pain, and,
very clearly, the bones are not broken.

617
00:58:42,427 --> 00:58:45,055
Broken? There's no bones left.

618
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:48,766
Much more flexible, though.

619
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:55,340
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

620
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,442
Should have been brought
straight to me.

621
00:58:57,442 --> 00:59:00,078
l can mend bones in a heartbeat,
but growing them back...

622
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,747
You will be able to, won't you?

623
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:04,875
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.

624
00:59:05,517 --> 00:59:10,181
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

625
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,083
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

626
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,531
Kill.

627
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,894
Kill.

628
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:35,508
Time to kill.

629
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:42,642
Hello.

630
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:45,691
Dobby?

631
00:59:45,691 --> 00:59:48,493
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

632
00:59:48,493 --> 00:59:52,397
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

633
00:59:52,397 --> 00:59:57,302
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

634
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,271
Indeed. Yes, sir.

635
01:00:01,273 --> 01:00:06,478
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.

636
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:09,314
Harry Potter must go home.

637
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:13,085
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see--

638
01:00:13,085 --> 01:00:16,655
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

639
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,359
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

640
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:23,988
Dobby had to iron his hands.

641
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:30,827
You better clear off before my bones
come back, Dobby, or l might strangle you.

642
01:00:33,472 --> 01:00:38,844
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.

643
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,913
l don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

644
01:00:41,913 --> 01:00:45,951
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.

645
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:49,488
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

646
01:00:49,488 --> 01:00:52,758
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

647
01:00:52,758 --> 01:00:56,661
We house-elves were
treated like vermin, sir.

648
01:00:56,661 --> 01:01:02,031
Of course, Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

649
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:14,179
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?

650
01:01:14,179 --> 01:01:19,484
This, sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

651
01:01:19,484 --> 01:01:24,581
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

652
01:01:26,725 --> 01:01:28,293
Listen.

653
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:29,995
Listen!

654
01:01:29,995 --> 01:01:33,726
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

655
01:01:34,366 --> 01:01:36,968
Harry Potter must not stay here...

656
01:01:36,968 --> 01:01:41,673
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

657
01:01:41,673 --> 01:01:45,310
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

658
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:47,301
l shouldn't have said that.

659
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:54,352
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!

660
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:56,047
Stop it, Dobby!

661
01:01:57,722 --> 01:02:01,660
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

662
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:07,065
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

663
01:02:07,065 --> 01:02:09,966
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

664
01:02:21,813 --> 01:02:22,905
Put him here.

665
01:02:27,486 --> 01:02:30,589
- What happened?
- There's been another attack.

666
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:36,425
l think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.

667
01:02:37,195 --> 01:02:41,894
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

668
01:02:50,008 --> 01:02:52,944
What can this mean, Albus?

669
01:02:52,944 --> 01:02:55,247
It means...

670
01:02:55,247 --> 01:02:58,183
...that our students
are in great danger.

671
01:02:58,183 --> 01:03:01,820
- What should l tell the staff?
- The truth.

672
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,924
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

673
01:03:05,924 --> 01:03:09,127
It is as we feared, Minerva.

674
01:03:09,127 --> 01:03:13,655
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

675
01:03:16,535 --> 01:03:20,839
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

676
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,742
Of course.
Don't you see?

677
01:03:23,742 --> 01:03:26,768
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

678
01:03:27,379 --> 01:03:30,148
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.

679
01:03:30,148 --> 01:03:33,485
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

680
01:03:33,485 --> 01:03:37,589
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

681
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:41,548
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

682
01:03:42,494 --> 01:03:45,156
No. No one ever comes in here.

683
01:03:45,997 --> 01:03:48,700
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.

684
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:50,668
Who?

685
01:03:51,169 --> 01:03:53,071
Moaning Myrtle.

686
01:03:53,071 --> 01:03:56,472
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.

687
01:04:02,347 --> 01:04:04,883
l wouldn't expect you to know me.

688
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:08,086
Who would ever talk
about ugly, miserable...

689
01:04:08,086 --> 01:04:11,522
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

690
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:20,823
She's a little sensitive.

691
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,672
Gather round!

692
01:04:27,672 --> 01:04:32,811
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

693
01:04:32,811 --> 01:04:35,939
Can you all hear me?

694
01:04:36,615 --> 01:04:37,946
Excellent.

695
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:42,354
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

696
01:04:42,354 --> 01:04:47,225
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

697
01:04:47,225 --> 01:04:52,030
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

698
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,766
...as l myself have done
on countless occasions.

699
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:58,429
For full details,
see my published works.

700
01:05:03,074 --> 01:05:06,378
Let me introduce my assistant...

701
01:05:06,378 --> 01:05:09,006
...Professor Snape.

702
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:15,320
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

703
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,522
l don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

704
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:22,459
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

705
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,132
One.

706
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:40,967
Two.

707
01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:44,806
- Three!
- Expelliarmus!

708
01:05:53,425 --> 01:05:56,261
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?

709
01:05:56,261 --> 01:05:59,397
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...

710
01:05:59,397 --> 01:06:04,069
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was
pretty obvious what you were about to do.

711
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:07,472
lf l had wanted to stop you,
it would have been only too easy.

712
01:06:07,472 --> 01:06:11,109
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

713
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:15,603
...to block unfriendly spells,
professor.

714
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:19,782
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.

715
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:25,490
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?

716
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:29,394
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

717
01:06:29,394 --> 01:06:33,298
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

718
01:06:33,298 --> 01:06:37,325
Might l suggest someone
from my own house?

719
01:06:38,636 --> 01:06:41,104
Malfoy, perhaps?

720
01:06:48,646 --> 01:06:51,114
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.

721
01:06:59,124 --> 01:07:01,024
Wands at the ready.

722
01:07:01,659 --> 01:07:04,628
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.

723
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,975
On the count of three...

724
01:07:16,975 --> 01:07:21,479
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

725
01:07:21,479 --> 01:07:25,006
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

726
01:07:26,785 --> 01:07:29,345
- Two.
- Everte Statum!

727
01:07:41,032 --> 01:07:43,262
Rictusempra!

728
01:07:54,245 --> 01:07:56,214
l said disarm only.

729
01:07:56,214 --> 01:07:58,182
Serpensortia!

730
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:09,794
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.

731
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:15,232
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!

732
01:08:57,809 --> 01:09:00,403
Vipera Evanesca.

733
01:09:07,118 --> 01:09:09,484
What are you playing at?

734
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:25,169
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

735
01:09:25,169 --> 01:09:27,605
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.

736
01:09:27,605 --> 01:09:33,077
l know. l accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

737
01:09:33,077 --> 01:09:37,215
Once. But so what?
l bet loads of people here can do it.

738
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,981
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.

739
01:09:41,486 --> 01:09:43,354
This is bad.

740
01:09:43,354 --> 01:09:47,292
What's bad? lf l hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin--

741
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:50,962
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.

742
01:09:50,962 --> 01:09:55,033
l heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

743
01:09:55,033 --> 01:09:57,900
l spoke a different language?

744
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:01,539
But l didn't realize--

745
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:04,475
How can l speak a language
without knowing l can?

746
01:10:04,475 --> 01:10:08,680
l don't know, but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

747
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,782
Harry, listen to me.

748
01:10:10,782 --> 01:10:13,818
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

749
01:10:13,818 --> 01:10:18,623
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

750
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,824
Exactly.

751
01:10:19,824 --> 01:10:23,361
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

752
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:25,329
But I'm not.

753
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:30,033
l can't be.

754
01:10:31,169 --> 01:10:33,371
He lived a thousand years ago.

755
01:10:33,371 --> 01:10:36,602
For all we know, you could be.

756
01:11:06,671 --> 01:11:09,037
I'll see you back in the common room.

757
01:11:25,456 --> 01:11:29,722
l want blood.

758
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:37,657
They all must die.

759
01:11:38,236 --> 01:11:40,227
Kill.

760
01:11:40,905 --> 01:11:42,998
Kill.

761
01:11:43,775 --> 01:11:46,411
Kill.

762
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:50,472
Time to kill.

763
01:12:24,649 --> 01:12:26,717
Caught in the act.

764
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,685
I'll have you out this time, Potter.

765
01:12:29,187 --> 01:12:31,856
Mark my words.

766
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:36,088
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand--

767
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:04,922
Professor...

768
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,491
...l swear l didn't.

769
01:13:06,491 --> 01:13:09,688
This is out of my hands, Potter.

770
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:22,032
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

771
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:33,542
Sherbet Lemon.

772
01:14:07,451 --> 01:14:09,578
Professor Dumbledore?

773
01:14:26,103 --> 01:14:28,799
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?

774
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:36,380
l was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

775
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:42,019
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

776
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:45,723
But l stand by what l said last year.

777
01:14:45,723 --> 01:14:49,327
You would have done well in Slytherin.

778
01:14:49,327 --> 01:14:50,658
You're wrong.

779
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,692
Harry?

780
01:15:21,692 --> 01:15:24,095
Professor.

781
01:15:24,095 --> 01:15:27,895
Your bird...
There was nothing l could do.

782
01:15:28,499 --> 01:15:31,798
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.

783
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:35,139
He's been looking dreadful for days.

784
01:15:35,139 --> 01:15:37,164
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

785
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:42,480
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.

786
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:46,017
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

787
01:15:46,017 --> 01:15:48,286
...and then they are...

788
01:15:48,286 --> 01:15:51,312
...reborn from the ashes.

789
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:02,767
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.

790
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:06,837
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

791
01:16:06,837 --> 01:16:09,670
Their tears have healing powers.

792
01:16:12,276 --> 01:16:15,336
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!

793
01:16:16,314 --> 01:16:18,441
Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasn't Harry.

794
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:22,484
l'd be prepared to swear it
 in front of the Ministry of Magic.

795
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,854
Relax.

796
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,726
l do not believe...

797
01:16:28,726 --> 01:16:32,093
- ...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.

798
01:16:36,033 --> 01:16:38,803
Right. Well, I'll...

799
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:41,931
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.

800
01:16:45,609 --> 01:16:49,447
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.

801
01:16:49,447 --> 01:16:51,938
l do not think it was you.

802
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,780
But l must ask you...

803
01:16:55,353 --> 01:16:59,449
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

804
01:17:05,863 --> 01:17:07,965
No, sir.

805
01:17:07,965 --> 01:17:09,455
Nothing.

806
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:14,805
Very well, then.

807
01:17:14,805 --> 01:17:16,602
Off you go.

808
01:17:54,578 --> 01:17:58,282
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

809
01:17:58,282 --> 01:18:00,117
Crabbe and Goyle.

810
01:18:00,117 --> 01:18:03,087
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

811
01:18:03,087 --> 01:18:06,657
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

812
01:18:06,657 --> 01:18:09,527
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.

813
01:18:09,527 --> 01:18:12,263
l filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

814
01:18:12,263 --> 01:18:15,266
Simple, but powerful.

815
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:17,601
Now, once they're asleep...

816
01:18:17,601 --> 01:18:20,971
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

817
01:18:20,971 --> 01:18:23,040
...and put on their uniforms.

818
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:26,477
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.

819
01:18:26,477 --> 01:18:29,847
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

820
01:18:29,847 --> 01:18:32,183
l got this off her robes.

821
01:18:32,183 --> 01:18:34,952
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

822
01:18:34,952 --> 01:18:37,682
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

823
01:18:49,834 --> 01:18:52,369
Ron, maybe l should do it.

824
01:18:52,369 --> 01:18:54,428
Yeah. Right.

825
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,505
Wingardium Leviosa.

826
01:19:08,586 --> 01:19:10,178
Cool.

827
01:19:33,344 --> 01:19:35,346
How thick could you get?

828
01:19:35,346 --> 01:19:37,314
Come on, let's get them.

829
01:19:40,017 --> 01:19:43,976
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

830
01:19:52,196 --> 01:19:54,164
Add the hairs.

831
01:19:58,702 --> 01:20:00,604
Essence of Crabbe.

832
01:20:00,604 --> 01:20:02,504
Cheers.

833
01:20:11,215 --> 01:20:13,649
l think I'm gonna be sick.

834
01:20:16,554 --> 01:20:18,385
Me too.

835
01:21:03,267 --> 01:21:05,469
Harry?

836
01:21:05,469 --> 01:21:07,027
Ron.

837
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:09,932
Bloody hell!

838
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,177
We still sound like ourselves.

839
01:21:13,177 --> 01:21:14,940
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

840
01:21:16,113 --> 01:21:18,749
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.

841
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:21,452
- But where's Hermione?
- l...

842
01:21:21,452 --> 01:21:24,622
l don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

843
01:21:24,622 --> 01:21:26,490
Hermione, are you okay?

844
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:29,323
Just go. You're wasting time.

845
01:21:31,395 --> 01:21:33,056
Come on.

846
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:39,934
l think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

847
01:21:42,906 --> 01:21:45,374
Excuse me.

848
01:21:47,177 --> 01:21:49,279
What are you doing d--?

849
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:51,338
l mean, what are you doing down here?

850
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:56,186
l happen to be a school prefect.

851
01:21:56,186 --> 01:22:00,555
You, on the other hand, have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

852
01:22:01,158 --> 01:22:03,160
What are your names again?

853
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:07,331
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you two been?

854
01:22:07,331 --> 01:22:10,357
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

855
01:22:11,869 --> 01:22:14,167
Why are you wearing glasses?

856
01:22:15,005 --> 01:22:17,838
- Reading.
- Reading?

857
01:22:19,009 --> 01:22:21,307
l didn't know you could read.

858
01:22:24,181 --> 01:22:26,450
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?

859
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:28,475
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.

860
01:22:37,294 --> 01:22:39,262
Well, sit down.

861
01:22:41,832 --> 01:22:46,170
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods, the way they behave.

862
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:50,004
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

863
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:53,105
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?

864
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,074
Stomachache.

865
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:04,021
You know, I'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

866
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:06,790
l suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

867
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:09,359
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

868
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,159
- ...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!

869
01:23:20,637 --> 01:23:22,005
What?

870
01:23:22,005 --> 01:23:25,843
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

871
01:23:25,843 --> 01:23:28,243
Well? Do you?

872
01:23:28,779 --> 01:23:30,644
Harry Potter?

873
01:23:37,254 --> 01:23:38,822
Good one, Goyle.

874
01:23:38,822 --> 01:23:40,346
You're absolutely right.

875
01:23:41,024 --> 01:23:42,855
Saint Potter.

876
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,658
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

877
01:23:50,434 --> 01:23:53,203
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

878
01:23:53,203 --> 01:23:56,900
You know l don't, Goyle.
l told you yesterday.

879
01:23:57,875 --> 01:24:00,343
How many times do l have to tell you?

880
01:24:01,311 --> 01:24:03,176
ls this yours?

881
01:24:07,618 --> 01:24:10,420
But my father did say this:

882
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,490
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

883
01:24:13,490 --> 01:24:18,162
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

884
01:24:18,162 --> 01:24:23,000
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened, a Mudblood died.

885
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,300
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

886
01:24:27,905 --> 01:24:29,907
As for me...

887
01:24:29,907 --> 01:24:32,242
...l hope it's Granger.

888
01:24:32,242 --> 01:24:34,611
What's the matter with you two?

889
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:37,281
You're acting very odd.

890
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:39,650
It's his stomachache.

891
01:24:39,650 --> 01:24:41,709
Calm down.

892
01:24:45,923 --> 01:24:47,891
Scar.

893
01:24:51,528 --> 01:24:52,961
Hair.

894
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:01,434
Hey! Where are you going?

895
01:25:04,441 --> 01:25:05,876
That was close.

896
01:25:05,876 --> 01:25:08,478
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

897
01:25:08,478 --> 01:25:10,343
Go away.

898
01:25:10,848 --> 01:25:14,750
Wait till you see. It's awful.

899
01:25:16,687 --> 01:25:18,622
Hermione?

900
01:25:18,622 --> 01:25:20,249
Are you okay?

901
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:24,261
Do you remember me telling you...

902
01:25:24,261 --> 01:25:27,598
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

903
01:25:27,598 --> 01:25:31,728
It was cat hair l plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

904
01:25:34,104 --> 01:25:35,662
Look at my face.

905
01:25:36,807 --> 01:25:39,241
Look at your tail.

906
01:25:45,816 --> 01:25:47,451
Have you spoken to Hermione?

907
01:25:47,451 --> 01:25:50,153
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

908
01:25:50,153 --> 01:25:52,951
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

909
01:25:57,761 --> 01:25:59,524
What's this?

910
01:26:04,034 --> 01:26:05,269
Yuck!

911
01:26:05,269 --> 01:26:08,067
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

912
01:26:24,321 --> 01:26:28,892
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would l throw something at you?

913
01:26:28,892 --> 01:26:33,130
Don't ask me. Here l am,
minding my own business...

914
01:26:33,130 --> 01:26:36,967
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

915
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:40,037
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

916
01:26:40,037 --> 01:26:42,437
l mean, it'll just go
right through you.

917
01:26:43,473 --> 01:26:48,045
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

918
01:26:48,045 --> 01:26:50,814
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

919
01:26:50,814 --> 01:26:54,306
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

920
01:26:54,851 --> 01:26:59,623
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- l don't know. l didn't see them.

921
01:26:59,623 --> 01:27:03,994
l was just sitting in the U-bend,
thinking about death...

922
01:27:03,994 --> 01:27:07,657
...and it fell through the top
of my head.

923
01:27:37,861 --> 01:27:40,329
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."

924
01:28:10,193 --> 01:28:12,696
My name...

925
01:28:12,696 --> 01:28:15,631
...is Harry...

926
01:28:17,234 --> 01:28:19,361
...Potter.

927
01:28:32,616 --> 01:28:37,781
Do you know anything...

928
01:28:38,622 --> 01:28:45,323
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

929
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:57,373
Can you...

930
01:28:58,608 --> 01:29:00,838
...tell me?

931
01:30:03,173 --> 01:30:06,609
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

932
01:30:10,046 --> 01:30:12,549
Are you Tom Riddle?

933
01:30:12,549 --> 01:30:14,346
Hello, can you hear me?

934
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:36,700
Riddle!

935
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:39,009
Come.

936
01:30:39,009 --> 01:30:41,000
Professor Dumbledore.

937
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:45,341
Dumbledore?

938
01:30:46,650 --> 01:30:50,287
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour, Tom.

939
01:30:50,287 --> 01:30:53,823
Yes, professor. l suppose l...

940
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:55,984
l had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

941
01:30:56,593 --> 01:30:59,663
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.

942
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:02,632
About the school as well?
l don't have a home to go to.

943
01:31:02,632 --> 01:31:05,635
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts,
would they, professor?

944
01:31:05,635 --> 01:31:08,160
l understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...

945
01:31:08,939 --> 01:31:12,042
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

946
01:31:12,042 --> 01:31:16,536
Sir, if it all stopped,
if the person responsible was caught...

947
01:31:18,815 --> 01:31:20,908
ls there something...

948
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,842
...you wish to tell me?

949
01:31:25,055 --> 01:31:27,580
No, sir. Nothing.

950
01:31:34,397 --> 01:31:37,601
Very well, then. Off you go.

951
01:31:37,601 --> 01:31:39,466
Good night, sir.

952
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:18,808
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.

953
01:32:18,808 --> 01:32:23,313
I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid.
l don't think you meant it to kill anyone...

954
01:32:23,313 --> 01:32:25,782
You can't. You don't understand.

955
01:32:25,782 --> 01:32:29,085
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

956
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:32,255
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

957
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:35,725
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

958
01:32:35,725 --> 01:32:38,061
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.

959
01:32:38,061 --> 01:32:39,863
- Now, stand aside.
- No!

960
01:32:39,863 --> 01:32:41,998
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!

961
01:32:41,998 --> 01:32:43,625
Cistem Aperio!

962
01:32:50,573 --> 01:32:52,939
Arania Exumai!

963
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:55,328
Aragog!

964
01:32:55,328 --> 01:32:56,673
Aragog!

965
01:32:57,213 --> 01:32:58,612
l can't let you go.

966
01:32:59,149 --> 01:33:02,380
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

967
01:33:04,921 --> 01:33:06,821
Hagrid!

968
01:33:36,853 --> 01:33:41,191
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

969
01:33:41,191 --> 01:33:44,327
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

970
01:33:44,327 --> 01:33:48,565
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me.

971
01:33:48,565 --> 01:33:52,369
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?

972
01:33:52,369 --> 01:33:56,539
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

973
01:33:56,539 --> 01:33:59,376
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.

974
01:33:59,376 --> 01:34:03,313
Tell us, have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"

975
01:34:03,313 --> 01:34:06,850
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me, now, would you?

976
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:07,839
No.

977
01:34:12,389 --> 01:34:14,457
What's that you've got, Hagrid?

978
01:34:14,457 --> 01:34:19,195
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.

979
01:34:19,195 --> 01:34:23,032
Now, according to Professor Sprout,
they've still got a bit of growing up to do.

980
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:26,703
But once their acne's cleared up, we'll
be able to chop them up and stew them...

981
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:30,002
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

982
01:34:31,441 --> 01:34:34,511
In the meantime, though, you three...

983
01:34:34,511 --> 01:34:37,674
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

984
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,455
Hello, Neville.

985
01:34:48,591 --> 01:34:51,461
Harry, l don't know who did it,
but you'd better come.

986
01:34:51,461 --> 01:34:53,156
Come on!

987
01:35:15,652 --> 01:35:19,889
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

988
01:35:19,889 --> 01:35:22,292
Unless it wasn't a student.

989
01:35:22,292 --> 01:35:25,895
Whoever it was, they must have
been looking for something.

990
01:35:25,895 --> 01:35:27,294
And they found it.

991
01:35:28,031 --> 01:35:30,522
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

992
01:35:32,135 --> 01:35:33,603
All right, listen up.

993
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:36,673
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

994
01:35:36,673 --> 01:35:38,708
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.

995
01:35:38,708 --> 01:35:41,911
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

996
01:35:41,911 --> 01:35:45,369
- ...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.

997
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:48,351
Professor McGonagall.

998
01:35:48,351 --> 01:35:51,554
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.

999
01:35:51,554 --> 01:35:56,693
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1000
01:35:56,693 --> 01:35:59,729
Potter, you and l will find Mr. Weasley.

1001
01:35:59,729 --> 01:36:02,197
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1002
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:07,895
l warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1003
01:36:16,279 --> 01:36:17,647
Hermione!

1004
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,444
She was found near the library...

1005
01:36:20,683 --> 01:36:22,742
...along with this.

1006
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:27,018
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1007
01:36:27,018 --> 01:36:42,272
No.

1008
01:36:42,272 --> 01:36:44,774
Could l have your attention, please?

1009
01:36:44,774 --> 01:36:50,747
Because of recent events, these new rules
will be put into effect immediately:

1010
01:36:50,747 --> 01:36:56,052
"All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1011
01:36:56,052 --> 01:37:00,256
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1012
01:37:00,256 --> 01:37:03,225
No exceptions."

1013
01:37:03,927 --> 01:37:06,162
l should tell you this:

1014
01:37:06,162 --> 01:37:10,258
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1015
01:37:10,833 --> 01:37:13,996
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1016
01:37:25,515 --> 01:37:28,618
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
l can't believe it's him...

1017
01:37:28,618 --> 01:37:31,087
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1018
01:37:31,087 --> 01:37:34,457
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1019
01:37:34,457 --> 01:37:35,858
But you heard McGonagall.

1020
01:37:35,858 --> 01:37:39,629
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1021
01:37:39,629 --> 01:37:42,097
l think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1022
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,441
Who's there?

1023
01:38:01,184 --> 01:38:02,742
Hello?

1024
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:04,909
Hello?

1025
01:38:06,122 --> 01:38:10,593
- What's that for?
- Nothing. l was expecting...

1026
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:14,461
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
l just made a pot of tea.

1027
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:19,669
Hagrid, are you okay?

1028
01:38:19,669 --> 01:38:22,570
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1029
01:38:23,506 --> 01:38:25,235
Did you hear about Hermione?

1030
01:38:25,742 --> 01:38:29,746
Yeah. l heard about that, all right.

1031
01:38:29,746 --> 01:38:33,375
Look, we have to ask you something.

1032
01:38:35,084 --> 01:38:38,576
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1033
01:38:40,923 --> 01:38:43,187
What you had to understand
about that is--

1034
01:38:44,894 --> 01:38:46,486
Quick, under the cloak.

1035
01:38:47,163 --> 01:38:50,223
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.

1036
01:38:56,672 --> 01:38:59,842
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.

1037
01:38:59,842 --> 01:39:02,445
l wonder, could we...?

1038
01:39:02,445 --> 01:39:05,114
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1039
01:39:05,114 --> 01:39:06,649
That's Dad's boss.

1040
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:10,420
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.

1041
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:14,991
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.

1042
01:39:14,991 --> 01:39:18,394
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1043
01:39:18,394 --> 01:39:21,831
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But l never--

1044
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:23,766
You know l never, professor.

1045
01:39:23,766 --> 01:39:27,036
l want it understood, Cornelius...

1046
01:39:27,036 --> 01:39:29,038
...that Hagrid...

1047
01:39:29,038 --> 01:39:31,507
...has my full confidence.

1048
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:35,478
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.

1049
01:39:35,478 --> 01:39:38,181
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?

1050
01:39:38,181 --> 01:39:40,783
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1051
01:39:40,783 --> 01:39:44,514
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.

1052
01:39:45,188 --> 01:39:47,256
Already here, Fudge?

1053
01:39:47,256 --> 01:39:48,587
Good.

1054
01:39:49,492 --> 01:39:52,256
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1055
01:39:52,929 --> 01:39:54,764
Believe me...

1056
01:39:54,764 --> 01:39:58,962
...l take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your...

1057
01:40:00,837 --> 01:40:03,067
You call this a house?

1058
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:05,341
No.

1059
01:40:05,341 --> 01:40:09,412
l simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1060
01:40:09,412 --> 01:40:13,473
Well, what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1061
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:18,817
The other governors and l have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1062
01:40:20,456 --> 01:40:23,357
This is an order of suspension.

1063
01:40:28,931 --> 01:40:32,298
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1064
01:40:36,172 --> 01:40:40,370
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1065
01:40:41,110 --> 01:40:43,646
Well, what, with all these attacks...

1066
01:40:43,646 --> 01:40:46,582
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1067
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:51,353
l can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1068
01:40:51,353 --> 01:40:53,822
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1069
01:40:53,822 --> 01:40:56,559
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1070
01:40:56,559 --> 01:40:59,195
You mark my words,
there'll be killings next!

1071
01:40:59,195 --> 01:41:00,930
You think so?

1072
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:03,421
Calm yourself, Hagrid.

1073
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:07,703
lf the governors desire my removal...

1074
01:41:07,703 --> 01:41:11,400
...l will, of course, step aside.

1075
01:41:13,008 --> 01:41:15,238
However...

1076
01:41:15,911 --> 01:41:20,649
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1077
01:41:20,649 --> 01:41:22,685
...to those who...

1078
01:41:22,685 --> 01:41:25,051
...ask for it.

1079
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:34,363
Admirable sentiments.

1080
01:41:34,363 --> 01:41:36,160
Shall we?

1081
01:41:48,277 --> 01:41:49,801
Fudge.

1082
01:41:51,547 --> 01:41:53,378
Come, Hagrid.

1083
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,041
Well?

1084
01:41:56,719 --> 01:41:58,187
lf...

1085
01:41:58,187 --> 01:42:00,889
lf anybody was looking for some stuff...

1086
01:42:00,889 --> 01:42:05,928
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1087
01:42:05,928 --> 01:42:08,697
Yep. That would lead them right.

1088
01:42:08,697 --> 01:42:10,631
That's all l have to say.

1089
01:42:12,368 --> 01:42:16,099
And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1090
01:42:19,475 --> 01:42:21,466
Good boy.

1091
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,342
Hagrid's right.

1092
01:42:30,342 --> 01:42:33,445
With Dumbledore gone,
there'll be an attack a day.

1093
01:42:33,445 --> 01:42:35,072
Look.

1094
01:42:41,186 --> 01:42:42,983
Come on.

1095
01:42:46,692 --> 01:42:48,717
Come on, Fang.

1096
01:43:06,978 --> 01:43:08,480
Come on.

1097
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:09,981
What?

1098
01:43:09,981 --> 01:43:13,385
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."

1099
01:43:13,385 --> 01:43:16,013
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1100
01:43:18,056 --> 01:43:22,516
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?

1101
01:43:58,296 --> 01:44:00,992
Harry, l don't like this.

1102
01:44:06,104 --> 01:44:09,301
- Harry, l don't like this at all.
- Shush!

1103
01:44:20,886 --> 01:44:23,588
Can we go back now?

1104
01:44:23,588 --> 01:44:25,317
Come on.

1105
01:45:15,006 --> 01:45:17,770
Who is it?

1106
01:45:18,476 --> 01:45:19,911
Don't panic.

1107
01:45:19,911 --> 01:45:21,847
Hagrid?

1108
01:45:21,847 --> 01:45:23,405
ls that you?

1109
01:45:24,015 --> 01:45:25,949
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1110
01:45:44,035 --> 01:45:47,232
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?

1111
01:45:47,873 --> 01:45:49,341
Yes.

1112
01:45:49,341 --> 01:45:53,311
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1113
01:45:53,311 --> 01:45:56,439
He's in trouble. Up at the school,
there have been attacks.

1114
01:45:57,082 --> 01:45:59,184
They think it's Hagrid.

1115
01:45:59,184 --> 01:46:02,954
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1116
01:46:02,954 --> 01:46:05,252
That's a lie.

1117
01:46:05,757 --> 01:46:08,692
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1118
01:46:09,327 --> 01:46:12,364
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.

1119
01:46:12,364 --> 01:46:15,634
The monster was born in the castle.

1120
01:46:15,634 --> 01:46:20,901
l came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1121
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:23,133
Harry.

1122
01:46:25,076 --> 01:46:29,814
But if you're not the monster, then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1123
01:46:29,814 --> 01:46:33,151
We do not speak of it.

1124
01:46:33,151 --> 01:46:38,890
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1125
01:46:38,890 --> 01:46:40,653
But have you seen it?

1126
01:46:41,326 --> 01:46:47,332
l never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1127
01:46:47,332 --> 01:46:50,669
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1128
01:46:50,669 --> 01:46:55,340
When l was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.

1129
01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:57,365
- Harry!
- What?

1130
01:47:10,188 --> 01:47:13,180
Well, thank you.

1131
01:47:14,125 --> 01:47:16,761
We'll just go.

1132
01:47:16,761 --> 01:47:18,697
Go?

1133
01:47:18,697 --> 01:47:20,632
l think not.

1134
01:47:20,632 --> 01:47:26,271
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1135
01:47:26,271 --> 01:47:28,840
But l cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1136
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:33,411
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1137
01:47:33,411 --> 01:47:37,349
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.

1138
01:47:37,349 --> 01:47:39,180
Can we panic now?

1139
01:47:49,894 --> 01:47:51,997
Know any spells?

1140
01:47:51,997 --> 01:47:55,333
One, but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1141
01:47:55,333 --> 01:47:58,063
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1142
01:48:11,549 --> 01:48:12,846
Let's go!

1143
01:48:17,989 --> 01:48:20,048
Arania Exumai!

1144
01:48:25,363 --> 01:48:26,694
Go!

1145
01:48:44,716 --> 01:48:46,741
Glad we're out of there.

1146
01:48:53,758 --> 01:48:56,090
Arania Exumai!

1147
01:49:01,733 --> 01:49:05,499
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.

1148
01:49:16,448 --> 01:49:18,575
Get us out of here.

1149
01:49:19,117 --> 01:49:20,778
Now!

1150
01:49:22,887 --> 01:49:27,119
Come on!
Come on, move faster!

1151
01:49:29,828 --> 01:49:31,159
Come on! Go!

1152
01:49:48,680 --> 01:49:50,705
Get us in the air.

1153
01:49:51,816 --> 01:49:53,283
The flying gear's jammed!

1154
01:49:57,388 --> 01:50:01,154
- Come on! Pull!
 - I'm trying!

1155
01:50:30,522 --> 01:50:33,625
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1156
01:50:33,625 --> 01:50:37,959
lf Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.

1157
01:50:51,976 --> 01:50:55,380
l mean, what was the point
of sending us in there?

1158
01:50:55,380 --> 01:51:00,084
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.

1159
01:51:00,084 --> 01:51:03,688
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1160
01:51:03,688 --> 01:51:05,679
He was innocent.

1161
01:51:21,172 --> 01:51:23,640
Wish you were here, Hermione.

1162
01:51:24,175 --> 01:51:26,439
We need you.

1163
01:51:27,412 --> 01:51:29,471
Now more than ever.

1164
01:51:46,431 --> 01:51:49,832
- What's that?
- Ron...

1165
01:51:50,668 --> 01:51:55,128
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1166
01:51:55,673 --> 01:51:56,935
Come on.

1167
01:51:57,609 --> 01:52:00,712
"Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1168
01:52:00,712 --> 01:52:05,516
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1169
01:52:05,516 --> 01:52:09,454
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1170
01:52:09,454 --> 01:52:12,624
Spiders flee before it."
Ron, this is it.

1171
01:52:12,624 --> 01:52:15,593
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1172
01:52:15,593 --> 01:52:19,864
That's why l can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

1173
01:52:19,864 --> 01:52:25,131
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye, why is it no one's dead?

1174
01:52:35,813 --> 01:52:38,714
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1175
01:52:40,685 --> 01:52:43,279
Not directly, at least.

1176
01:52:44,522 --> 01:52:46,924
Colin saw it through his camera.

1177
01:52:46,924 --> 01:52:51,129
Justin-- Justin must have seen
the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1178
01:52:51,129 --> 01:52:55,300
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.

1179
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:58,603
And Hermione had the mirror.

1180
01:52:58,603 --> 01:53:02,106
l bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1181
01:53:02,106 --> 01:53:03,508
And Mrs. Norris?

1182
01:53:03,508 --> 01:53:07,000
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror, Harry.

1183
01:53:08,613 --> 01:53:10,948
The water.

1184
01:53:10,948 --> 01:53:16,477
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1185
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:24,762
"Spiders flee before it."

1186
01:53:24,762 --> 01:53:28,666
- It all fits.
- But how's a basilisk been getting around?

1187
01:53:28,666 --> 01:53:31,736
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1188
01:53:31,736 --> 01:53:37,508
- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.

1189
01:53:37,508 --> 01:53:41,979
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1190
01:53:41,979 --> 01:53:46,211
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1191
01:53:46,884 --> 01:53:48,215
Moaning Myrtle.

1192
01:53:49,187 --> 01:53:53,391
All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once,

1193
01:53:53,391 --> 01:53:56,827
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately,

1194
01:54:01,766 --> 01:54:07,772
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1195
01:54:07,772 --> 01:54:10,141
Our worst fear has been realized.

1196
01:54:10,141 --> 01:54:14,703
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1197
01:54:15,813 --> 01:54:21,479
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1198
01:54:23,855 --> 01:54:26,457
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have l missed?

1199
01:54:26,457 --> 01:54:30,995
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1200
01:54:30,995 --> 01:54:34,098
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...

1201
01:54:34,098 --> 01:54:38,626
...that you've known all along where
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1202
01:54:40,004 --> 01:54:45,643
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.

1203
01:54:45,643 --> 01:54:51,048
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.

1204
01:54:51,048 --> 01:54:54,245
I'll just be in my office getting...

1205
01:54:55,086 --> 01:54:57,054
Getting ready.

1206
01:54:59,891 --> 01:55:03,261
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?

1207
01:55:03,261 --> 01:55:05,092
Ginny Weasley.

1208
01:55:16,507 --> 01:55:19,567
"Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever."

1209
01:55:23,648 --> 01:55:25,411
Ginny.

1210
01:55:27,518 --> 01:55:31,189
Lockhart may be useless, but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1211
01:55:31,189 --> 01:55:33,919
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1212
01:55:35,259 --> 01:55:37,819
Professor, we have some information
for you.

1213
01:55:39,597 --> 01:55:41,732
Are you going somewhere?

1214
01:55:41,732 --> 01:55:45,002
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1215
01:55:45,002 --> 01:55:48,573
- What about my sister?
- Well...

1216
01:55:48,573 --> 01:55:52,243
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than l.

1217
01:55:52,243 --> 01:55:56,414
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1218
01:55:56,414 --> 01:55:59,550
l must say, when l took the job,
there was nothing in the description--

1219
01:55:59,550 --> 01:56:00,852
You're running away?

1220
01:56:00,852 --> 01:56:03,821
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.

1221
01:56:03,821 --> 01:56:06,557
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, do use your common sense.

1222
01:56:06,557 --> 01:56:10,960
My books wouldn't have sold half as well
if people didn't think l'd done those things.

1223
01:56:11,529 --> 01:56:13,297
You're a fraud.

1224
01:56:13,297 --> 01:56:16,267
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1225
01:56:16,267 --> 01:56:18,369
ls there anything you can do?

1226
01:56:18,369 --> 01:56:23,307
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1227
01:56:23,307 --> 01:56:25,977
Otherwise, all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1228
01:56:25,977 --> 01:56:29,247
l'd never have sold another book.

1229
01:56:29,247 --> 01:56:34,981
In fact, I'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1230
01:56:35,486 --> 01:56:38,250
Don't even think about it.

1231
01:56:49,133 --> 01:56:50,566
Who's there?

1232
01:56:53,004 --> 01:56:55,029
Hello, Harry.

1233
01:56:55,973 --> 01:57:01,070
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.

1234
01:57:03,447 --> 01:57:06,083
It was dreadful.

1235
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:09,954
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1236
01:57:09,954 --> 01:57:14,158
l'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1237
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:19,230
l was crying, and then
l heard somebody come in.

1238
01:57:19,230 --> 01:57:25,567
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- l don't know. l was distraught!

1239
01:57:26,871 --> 01:57:30,441
But they said something funny,
a kind of made-up language.

1240
01:57:30,441 --> 01:57:36,812
And l realized it was a boy, so l unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1241
01:57:38,015 --> 01:57:43,020
- ...l died.
- Just like that? How?

1242
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:47,692
l just remember seeing a pair
of great, big, yellow eyes...

1243
01:57:47,692 --> 01:57:51,526
...over there by that sink.

1244
01:58:16,587 --> 01:58:18,578
This is it.

1245
01:58:19,523 --> 01:58:24,324
This is it, Ron. l think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1246
01:58:26,330 --> 01:58:31,199
Say something. Harry,
say something in Parseltongue.

1247
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:26,991
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...

1248
01:59:26,991 --> 01:59:29,255
There's no need for me to stay.

1249
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:31,760
Yes, there is.

1250
01:59:33,564 --> 01:59:36,834
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?

1251
01:59:36,834 --> 01:59:38,165
Better you than us.

1252
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:42,305
But-- Obviously, yes.

1253
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:49,306
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1254
01:59:56,153 --> 01:59:59,857
It's really quite filthy down here.

1255
01:59:59,857 --> 02:00:04,795
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?

1256
02:00:04,795 --> 02:00:09,732
lf you die down there,
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1257
02:00:12,269 --> 02:00:14,237
Thanks, Myrtle.

1258
02:00:43,367 --> 02:00:48,566
Now, remember: Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straightaway.

1259
02:00:49,507 --> 02:00:51,168
Go on.

1260
02:00:54,879 --> 02:00:56,244
This way.

1261
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:08,626
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.

1262
02:01:08,626 --> 02:01:12,463
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.

1263
02:01:12,463 --> 02:01:18,265
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1264
02:01:20,171 --> 02:01:23,140
Heart of a lion, this one.

1265
02:01:26,844 --> 02:01:31,508
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.

1266
02:01:33,484 --> 02:01:39,290
The world will know our story.
How l was too late to save the girl.

1267
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:42,960
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1268
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:45,929
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1269
02:01:46,797 --> 02:01:48,230
So...

1270
02:01:49,366 --> 02:01:51,936
You first, Mr. Potter.

1271
02:01:51,936 --> 02:01:55,099
Say goodbye to your memories.

1272
02:01:57,174 --> 02:01:59,108
Obliviate!

1273
02:02:33,043 --> 02:02:36,137
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1274
02:02:39,917 --> 02:02:41,680
Hello.

1275
02:02:42,353 --> 02:02:44,184
Who are you?

1276
02:02:45,556 --> 02:02:48,392
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?

1277
02:02:48,392 --> 02:02:51,259
And who am l?

1278
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:57,668
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1279
02:02:57,668 --> 02:03:02,306
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?

1280
02:03:02,306 --> 02:03:04,399
Do you live here?

1281
02:03:05,109 --> 02:03:07,634
- No.
- Really?

1282
02:03:12,249 --> 02:03:14,218
- What do l do now?
- You wait here...

1283
02:03:14,218 --> 02:03:17,321
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1284
02:03:17,321 --> 02:03:20,984
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.

1285
02:04:54,251 --> 02:04:58,119
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.

1286
02:04:58,622 --> 02:05:00,924
Please wake up.

1287
02:05:00,924 --> 02:05:03,051
She won't wake.

1288
02:05:08,532 --> 02:05:13,037
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?

1289
02:05:13,037 --> 02:05:16,404
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.

1290
02:05:17,408 --> 02:05:19,910
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...

1291
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:22,310
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1292
02:05:24,982 --> 02:05:30,354
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.

1293
02:05:30,354 --> 02:05:32,923
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1294
02:05:32,923 --> 02:05:35,517
It won't come until it's called.

1295
02:05:38,328 --> 02:05:41,126
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.

1296
02:05:42,199 --> 02:05:45,769
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid l can't do that.

1297
02:05:45,769 --> 02:05:49,796
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
l grow stronger.

1298
02:05:51,175 --> 02:05:55,879
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1299
02:05:55,879 --> 02:05:58,382
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1300
02:05:58,382 --> 02:06:01,685
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1301
02:06:01,685 --> 02:06:04,288
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1302
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:07,758
- But why?
- Because l told her to.

1303
02:06:07,758 --> 02:06:12,896
You'll find l can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1304
02:06:12,896 --> 02:06:16,229
She was, shall we say,
in a kind of trance.

1305
02:06:16,767 --> 02:06:19,436
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1306
02:06:19,436 --> 02:06:21,972
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1307
02:06:21,972 --> 02:06:26,510
And then who should find it but you?

1308
02:06:26,510 --> 02:06:29,604
The very person
l was most anxious to meet.

1309
02:06:30,247 --> 02:06:32,716
And why did you want to meet me?

1310
02:06:32,716 --> 02:06:36,253
l knew l had to talk to you,
meet you if l could.

1311
02:06:36,253 --> 02:06:39,690
So l decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1312
02:06:39,690 --> 02:06:42,853
- ...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.

1313
02:06:43,794 --> 02:06:48,565
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.

1314
02:06:48,565 --> 02:06:52,002
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1315
02:06:52,002 --> 02:06:54,338
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1316
02:06:54,338 --> 02:06:57,975
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1317
02:06:57,975 --> 02:07:01,378
l knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while l was still at school...

1318
02:07:01,378 --> 02:07:03,413
...so l decided to leave behind
a diary...

1319
02:07:03,413 --> 02:07:05,682
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1320
02:07:05,682 --> 02:07:08,552
...so that one day
l would be able to lead another...

1321
02:07:08,552 --> 02:07:11,522
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1322
02:07:11,522 --> 02:07:13,957
Well, you haven't finished it
this time.

1323
02:07:13,957 --> 02:07:17,094
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1324
02:07:17,094 --> 02:07:20,230
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1325
02:07:20,230 --> 02:07:25,736
Haven't l told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1326
02:07:25,736 --> 02:07:30,503
For many months now,
my new target has been you.

1327
02:07:32,009 --> 02:07:35,779
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1328
02:07:35,779 --> 02:07:38,782
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1329
02:07:38,782 --> 02:07:41,885
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1330
02:07:41,885 --> 02:07:44,454
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1331
02:07:44,454 --> 02:07:48,792
Why do you care how l escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1332
02:07:48,792 --> 02:07:55,254
Voldemort is my past,
present and future.

1333
02:08:15,652 --> 02:08:19,088
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1334
02:08:22,259 --> 02:08:26,029
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...

1335
02:08:26,029 --> 02:08:30,701
...l was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1336
02:08:30,701 --> 02:08:35,038
No. l fashioned myself a new name,
a name l knew wizards everywhere...

1337
02:08:35,038 --> 02:08:39,409
...would one day fear to speak when l
became the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1338
02:08:39,409 --> 02:08:42,779
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1339
02:08:42,779 --> 02:08:46,350
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1340
02:08:46,350 --> 02:08:51,413
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1341
02:08:57,828 --> 02:08:58,817
Fawkes?

1342
02:09:15,078 --> 02:09:18,815
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1343
02:09:18,815 --> 02:09:22,512
A songbird and an old hat.

1344
02:09:35,799 --> 02:09:40,504
Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort,
Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1345
02:09:40,504 --> 02:09:44,531
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1346
02:09:57,888 --> 02:10:02,222
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.

1347
02:10:32,456 --> 02:10:34,458
No!

1348
02:10:34,458 --> 02:10:38,952
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk,
but it can still hear you.

1349
02:12:20,931 --> 02:12:24,401
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1350
02:12:24,401 --> 02:12:29,473
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead, and l will cease to be a memory.

1351
02:12:29,473 --> 02:12:32,509
Lord Voldemort will return...

1352
02:12:32,509 --> 02:12:36,741
...very much alive.

1353
02:12:37,481 --> 02:12:38,880
Ginny?

1354
02:14:55,218 --> 02:14:56,987
Remarkable, isn't it...

1355
02:14:56,987 --> 02:15:01,091
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1356
02:15:01,091 --> 02:15:04,094
l'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1357
02:15:04,094 --> 02:15:08,121
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.

1358
02:15:13,136 --> 02:15:17,007
Funny, the damage a silly
little book can do...

1359
02:15:17,007 --> 02:15:22,001
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1360
02:15:24,914 --> 02:15:26,711
What are you doing?

1361
02:15:29,552 --> 02:15:31,679
Stop. No!

1362
02:16:29,979 --> 02:16:34,117
It was me.
But l swear, l didn't mean to.

1363
02:16:34,117 --> 02:16:37,609
Riddle made me, and...

1364
02:16:38,154 --> 02:16:41,157
Harry, you're hurt.

1365
02:16:41,157 --> 02:16:42,826
Don't worry.

1366
02:16:42,826 --> 02:16:46,629
Ginny, you need
to get yourself out.

1367
02:16:46,629 --> 02:16:49,894
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1368
02:17:01,978 --> 02:17:04,105
You were brilliant, Fawkes.

1369
02:17:05,248 --> 02:17:07,682
l just wasn't quick enough.

1370
02:17:28,471 --> 02:17:30,473
Of course.

1371
02:17:30,473 --> 02:17:33,340
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1372
02:17:34,978 --> 02:17:36,741
Thanks.

1373
02:17:38,481 --> 02:17:40,608
It's all right, Ginny.

1374
02:17:41,785 --> 02:17:43,980
It's over.

1375
02:17:44,988 --> 02:17:47,479
It's just a memory.

1376
02:17:50,426 --> 02:17:55,762
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1377
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:09,846
You both realize, of course...

1378
02:18:09,846 --> 02:18:15,307
...that in the past few hours, you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1379
02:18:16,019 --> 02:18:17,187
Yes, sir.

1380
02:18:17,187 --> 02:18:20,590
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1381
02:18:20,590 --> 02:18:21,958
Yes, sir.

1382
02:18:21,958 --> 02:18:24,722
Therefore, it is only fitting...

1383
02:18:26,262 --> 02:18:28,526
...that you both receive...

1384
02:18:29,032 --> 02:18:33,128
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1385
02:18:35,205 --> 02:18:37,070
Thanks, sir.

1386
02:18:37,640 --> 02:18:40,109
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...

1387
02:18:40,109 --> 02:18:44,307
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1388
02:18:45,415 --> 02:18:50,182
l believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1389
02:18:55,158 --> 02:18:59,492
First, l want to thank you, Harry.

1390
02:19:00,063 --> 02:19:03,555
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1391
02:19:04,434 --> 02:19:08,996
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1392
02:19:11,407 --> 02:19:12,931
And...

1393
02:19:13,543 --> 02:19:15,144
...second...

1394
02:19:15,144 --> 02:19:20,149
...l sense that something
is troubling you.

1395
02:19:20,149 --> 02:19:22,617
Am l right, Harry?

1396
02:19:24,487 --> 02:19:26,216
It's just...

1397
02:19:27,390 --> 02:19:32,295
You see, sir, l couldn't help
but notice certain things, certain...

1398
02:19:32,295 --> 02:19:37,927
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1399
02:19:38,501 --> 02:19:39,869
l see.

1400
02:19:39,869 --> 02:19:46,109
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?

1401
02:19:46,109 --> 02:19:51,638
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1402
02:19:52,882 --> 02:19:56,019
lf I'm not mistaken, Harry...

1403
02:19:56,019 --> 02:20:00,023
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1404
02:20:00,023 --> 02:20:03,126
...the night he gave you that scar.

1405
02:20:03,126 --> 02:20:07,028
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1406
02:20:08,932 --> 02:20:11,628
Not intentionally...

1407
02:20:12,535 --> 02:20:14,435
...but yes.

1408
02:20:16,372 --> 02:20:19,842
So the Sorting Hat was right.
l should be in Slytherin.

1409
02:20:19,842 --> 02:20:24,881
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1410
02:20:24,881 --> 02:20:27,917
Determination, resourcefulness...

1411
02:20:27,917 --> 02:20:31,910
...and if l may say so,
a certain disregard for the rules.

1412
02:20:32,588 --> 02:20:36,581
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1413
02:20:37,393 --> 02:20:41,264
- Because l asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.

1414
02:20:41,264 --> 02:20:43,499
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1415
02:20:43,499 --> 02:20:47,670
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1416
02:20:47,670 --> 02:20:49,797
It is our choices.

1417
02:20:53,476 --> 02:20:57,080
lf you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1418
02:20:57,080 --> 02:21:01,881
...then l suggest
you look more closely at this.

1419
02:21:02,885 --> 02:21:04,580
Be careful.

1420
02:21:10,226 --> 02:21:13,062
Godric Gryffindor.

1421
02:21:13,062 --> 02:21:17,158
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1422
02:21:26,042 --> 02:21:27,441
Dobby.

1423
02:21:28,745 --> 02:21:33,114
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1424
02:21:35,318 --> 02:21:38,651
I'll deal with you later.

1425
02:21:44,494 --> 02:21:46,262
Out of my way, Potter.

1426
02:21:46,262 --> 02:21:49,857
So it's true. You have returned.

1427
02:21:50,533 --> 02:21:53,469
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1428
02:21:53,469 --> 02:21:57,667
...was taken into the Chamber,
they saw fit to summon me back.

1429
02:21:58,508 --> 02:22:02,712
- Ridiculous.
- Curiously, Lucius, several of them...

1430
02:22:02,712 --> 02:22:06,549
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1431
02:22:06,549 --> 02:22:09,852
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1432
02:22:09,852 --> 02:22:13,489
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?

1433
02:22:13,489 --> 02:22:17,427
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1434
02:22:17,427 --> 02:22:20,430
...the welfare of this school...

1435
02:22:20,430 --> 02:22:24,730
...and, of course, its students.

1436
02:22:28,771 --> 02:22:33,409
The culprit has been identified,
l presume?

1437
02:22:33,409 --> 02:22:34,899
Yes.

1438
02:22:36,512 --> 02:22:38,343
And?

1439
02:22:39,515 --> 02:22:41,540
Who was it?

1440
02:22:47,990 --> 02:22:50,550
Voldemort.

1441
02:22:51,694 --> 02:22:57,155
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1442
02:22:57,700 --> 02:23:01,261
...by means of this.

1443
02:23:03,940 --> 02:23:05,464
l see.

1444
02:23:06,976 --> 02:23:11,547
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1445
02:23:11,547 --> 02:23:15,384
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1446
02:23:15,384 --> 02:23:18,955
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1447
02:23:18,955 --> 02:23:23,259
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1448
02:23:23,259 --> 02:23:25,124
...severe.

1449
02:23:26,529 --> 02:23:29,499
Well, let us hope...

1450
02:23:29,499 --> 02:23:35,028
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1451
02:23:35,805 --> 02:23:39,571
Don't worry. l will be.

1452
02:23:48,351 --> 02:23:50,342
Dumbledore.

1453
02:23:51,521 --> 02:23:55,048
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.

1454
02:24:12,308 --> 02:24:16,711
Sir?
l wonder if l could have that?

1455
02:24:23,186 --> 02:24:24,954
Mr. Malfoy.

1456
02:24:24,954 --> 02:24:27,623
Mr. Malfoy!

1457
02:24:27,623 --> 02:24:29,784
l have something of yours.

1458
02:24:31,460 --> 02:24:34,630
Mine? l don't know
what you're talking about.

1459
02:24:34,630 --> 02:24:36,332
l think you do, sir.

1460
02:24:36,332 --> 02:24:39,602
l think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1461
02:24:39,602 --> 02:24:41,035
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1462
02:24:41,737 --> 02:24:44,262
You do, do you?

1463
02:24:51,681 --> 02:24:54,741
Why don't you prove it?

1464
02:25:00,923 --> 02:25:03,084
Come, Dobby.

1465
02:25:04,393 --> 02:25:06,418
Open it.

1466
02:25:09,966 --> 02:25:11,667
Dobby.

1467
02:25:11,667 --> 02:25:15,104
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1468
02:25:15,104 --> 02:25:17,406
What? l didn't give--

1469
02:25:17,406 --> 02:25:21,277
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1470
02:25:21,277 --> 02:25:24,303
Dobby is free.

1471
02:25:30,886 --> 02:25:34,617
You lost me my servant!

1472
02:25:41,597 --> 02:25:45,590
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1473
02:25:57,780 --> 02:26:01,584
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1474
02:26:01,584 --> 02:26:04,920
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...

1475
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:10,119
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1476
02:26:15,831 --> 02:26:22,104
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1477
02:26:22,104 --> 02:26:26,336
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.

1478
02:26:28,311 --> 02:26:30,802
Never try to save my life again.

1479
02:26:36,952 --> 02:26:40,256
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1480
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:42,792
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.

1481
02:26:42,792 --> 02:26:45,693
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1482
02:26:47,096 --> 02:26:49,291
Hello.

1483
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,630
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.

1484
02:26:58,874 --> 02:27:02,173
Harry. It's Hermione.

1485
02:27:29,004 --> 02:27:32,908
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.

1486
02:27:32,908 --> 02:27:35,678
Congratulations.
l can't believe you solved it.

1487
02:27:35,678 --> 02:27:38,114
We had loads of help from you.

1488
02:27:38,114 --> 02:27:41,311
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.

1489
02:27:43,185 --> 02:27:46,154
Could l have your attention, please?

1490
02:27:50,292 --> 02:27:52,995
Before we begin the feast...

1491
02:27:52,995 --> 02:27:59,402
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...

1492
02:27:59,402 --> 02:28:03,672
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1493
02:28:03,672 --> 02:28:06,300
...to all who had been Petrified.

1494
02:28:16,852 --> 02:28:20,022
Also, in light of the recent events...

1495
02:28:20,022 --> 02:28:22,358
...as a school treat...

1496
02:28:22,358 --> 02:28:26,317
...all exams have been canceled.

1497
02:28:28,998 --> 02:28:30,556
Oh, no.

1498
02:28:47,550 --> 02:28:49,541
Sorry I'm late.

1499
02:28:55,624 --> 02:29:00,296
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1500
02:29:00,296 --> 02:29:03,595
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1501
02:29:19,415 --> 02:29:25,588
And l'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you, Harry and Ron...

1502
02:29:25,588 --> 02:29:28,523
...and Hermione, of course...

1503
02:29:29,191 --> 02:29:33,462
...l would still be you-know-where...

1504
02:29:33,462 --> 02:29:37,023
...so l'd just like to say thanks.

1505
02:29:46,442 --> 02:29:49,411
There's no Hogwarts
without you, Hagrid.
