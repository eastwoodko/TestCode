1
00:00:34,564 --> 00:00:36,828
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:00:39,102 --> 00:00:41,866
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,585
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:07,762
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:11,633
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:42,799
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,790
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:54,177
Marge. How lovely to see--

9
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:57,714
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:57,714 --> 00:01:59,216
What is it?

11
00:01:59,216 --> 00:02:01,518
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:02:01,518 --> 00:02:04,354
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:02:04,354 --> 00:02:06,723
I will if she does.

14
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:10,260
-Oh, you're still here, are you?
-Yes.

15
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,063
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:15,198
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:19,703
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:24,241
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,209
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:28,645
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:30,670
Okay.

22
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:36,918
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:37,921 --> 00:02:41,057
-Can I tempt you, Marge?
-Just a small one.

24
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:43,992
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:44,594 --> 00:02:46,585
A bit more.

26
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,667
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 1 2 dogs.

27
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,261
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:58,508
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:58,508 --> 00:03:02,535
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:03:04,047 --> 00:03:06,016
What are you smirking at?

31
00:03:06,016 --> 00:03:08,051
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

32
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:11,521
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:11,521 --> 00:03:14,547
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

34
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:19,396
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:22,365
Yeah. I've been beaten
loads of times.

36
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:25,135
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:28,471
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:31,741
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:35,845
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:35,845 --> 00:03:38,181
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

41
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:41,351
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:44,354
-And a drunk too, no doubt?
-That's a lie.

43
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:46,914
-What did you say?
-My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:54,164
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:54,164 --> 00:03:56,166
I think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:59,397
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,773
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:07,911
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:12,148
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:13,843
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,757
Right.

52
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:22,884
Let me tell you....

53
00:04:44,347 --> 00:04:46,474
Vernon!

54
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:51,317
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:05:34,731 --> 00:05:36,756
Stop!

56
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:41,895
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.

57
00:05:45,308 --> 00:05:47,333
-Hold on, hold on.
-Get off.

58
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,409
-Don't you dare!
-Sorry.

59
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:53,583
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,485
Oh, God.

61
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:57,282
Marge!

62
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,590
Please!

63
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:09,392
Marge!

64
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,663
Come back!

65
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,230
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,933
-You put her right!
-No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:47,270
-Keep away from me.
-You can't do magic outside school.

68
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,440
-Yeah? Try me.
-They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,941
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:54,273
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,442
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

72
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:35,979
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

73
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:40,939
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

74
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:46,120
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:49,225
-I fell over.
-What you fell over for?

76
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:52,095
-I didn't do it on purpose.
-Well, come on, then.

77
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:54,256
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:04,607
-What you looking at?
-Nothing.

79
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:06,509
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:09,342
No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.

81
00:09:14,317 --> 00:09:16,512
Come on.

82
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:29,160
Come on. Move on, move on.

83
00:09:43,913 --> 00:09:47,350
-Take her away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,580
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:03,561
-What did you say your name was?
-I didn't.

86
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:08,471
-Whereabouts are you headed?
-The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:11,574
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

88
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:14,077
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

89
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:16,875
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:10:20,283 --> 00:10:23,086
-But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
-Muggles?

91
00:10:23,086 --> 00:10:24,987
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:27,547
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:32,352
Ernie, little old lady at 1 2 o'clock!

94
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,840
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,743
...seven, six, five...

96
00:10:46,743 --> 00:10:49,212
...four, three, three and a half...

97
00:10:49,212 --> 00:10:50,975
...two, one and three quarters.

98
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:53,139
Yes!

99
00:10:57,487 --> 00:10:59,088
Who is that?

100
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:01,454
That man.

101
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,128
Who is that?

102
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:06,863
Who is--?

103
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:09,229
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,064
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,806
He's a murderer.

106
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,434
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:23,679
-How did he escape?
-Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,647
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:29,244
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,242
...You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:33,990
I reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,758
Yeah.

113
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:37,089
Him I've heard of.

114
00:11:39,796 --> 00:11:42,458
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 1 2 o'clock.

115
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,626
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:47,665
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:57,478
Mind your head.

118
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,520
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,681
Why the long faces?

120
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:14,962
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:12:20,403 --> 00:12:23,770
-The Leaky Cauldron.
-Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:12:25,107 --> 00:12:27,769
Mr. Potter, at last.

123
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,510
-Take it away, Ern.
-Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

124
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:58,537
Room 1 1.

125
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,612
Hedwig.

126
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:05,615
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:09,312
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,024
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

129
00:13:15,024 --> 00:13:18,394
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

130
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:22,532
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:13:22,532 --> 00:13:26,435
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:31,474
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:36,312
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:39,081
So that's that...

135
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:41,948
...and no harm done.

136
00:13:42,618 --> 00:13:44,120
Pea soup?

137
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,422
No, thank you.

138
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:48,791
-Minister?
-Yes?

139
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,726
-I don't understand.
-Understand?

140
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:54,497
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

141
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:57,667
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

142
00:13:57,667 --> 00:14:00,192
...for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:08,878
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

144
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:11,547
...was very, very irresponsible.

145
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:15,484
-"The state of things," sir?
-We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:14:15,484 --> 00:14:17,486
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:19,249
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:26,596
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:14:26,596 --> 00:14:29,865
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:33,002
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

151
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:36,995
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:41,911 --> 00:14:43,479
Hedwig.

153
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:48,684
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

154
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:51,152
...wander.

155
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:55,623
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:16,428
Housekeeping.

157
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,105
I'll come back later.

158
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,287
I'm warning you, Hermione.

159
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:35,191
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:16:35,191 --> 00:16:37,426
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:16:37,426 --> 00:16:40,596
-It's in his nature.
-A cat? Is that what they told you?

162
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:43,299
-Looks like a pig with hair.
-That's rich...

163
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:46,001
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:46,001 --> 00:16:48,671
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:48,671 --> 00:16:50,229
Harry.

166
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:52,740
Harry.

167
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:57,213
-Egypt. What's it like?
-Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

168
00:16:57,213 --> 00:17:00,750
...Iike mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,086
-Egyptians used to worship cats.
-Along with the dung beetle.

170
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:07,423
-Not flashing that clipping again?
-I haven't shown anyone.

171
00:17:07,423 --> 00:17:09,992
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:17:09,992 --> 00:17:11,594
-The day maid.
-Night maid.

173
00:17:11,594 --> 00:17:13,863
-Cook.
-The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:17:13,863 --> 00:17:15,464
-Harry.
-Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:17:15,464 --> 00:17:17,800
-Good to see you, dear.
-Good to see you.

176
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,301
-Got everything?
-Yes.

177
00:17:19,301 --> 00:17:21,637
-Yes? All your books?
-It's all upstairs.

178
00:17:21,637 --> 00:17:23,239
-Your clothes?
-Everything.

179
00:17:23,239 --> 00:17:24,640
-Good boy.
-Thank you.

180
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,842
-Harry Potter.
-Mr. Weasley.

181
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:30,546
-Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
-Yeah, sure.

182
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:33,349
-Hermione.
-Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:36,978
-Looking forward to a new term?
-Yeah. It should be great.

184
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:44,059
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

185
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:46,896
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:46,896 --> 00:17:50,399
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:52,993
You are in danger.

188
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:56,137
Grave danger.

189
00:17:56,639 --> 00:17:59,267
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:02,645
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:06,342
-Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
-Do you know why?

192
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,019
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped....

193
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:12,021
-Voldemort.
-Don't say his name.

194
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:13,522
Sorry.

195
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:16,592
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:18,394
...Black lost everything.

197
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:22,865
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:25,201
And in his mind...

199
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:28,370
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

200
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,308
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:18:32,308 --> 00:18:34,610
And that is why...

202
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,513
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:39,208
To find you.

204
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:42,310
And kill me.

205
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:46,088
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

206
00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:49,024
...you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:50,526
Mr. Weasley...

208
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:54,519
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:55,297 --> 00:18:57,233
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,064
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:02,071
Oh, for goodness' sake!

212
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:04,539
Don't lose him!

213
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:07,843
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just--

214
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:10,446
-I lost control.
-Brilliant.

215
00:19:10,446 --> 00:19:14,216
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:16,118
I was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:18,143
I still think it was brilliant.

218
00:19:18,754 --> 00:19:21,086
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:25,461
Who do you think that is?

220
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:28,497
-Professor R.J. Lupin.
-Do you know everything?

221
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:30,799
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,236
-It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
-Oh.

223
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:37,501
-Do you think he's really asleep?
-Seems to be. Why?

224
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:41,368
I gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:58,227
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

226
00:19:58,227 --> 00:20:00,329
-...to come after you?
-Yeah.

227
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,398
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

228
00:20:02,398 --> 00:20:05,367
-I mean, everyone's looking for him.
-Sure.

229
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:08,871
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

230
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:12,705
-...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
-Thanks, Ron.

231
00:20:14,176 --> 00:20:15,768
Why are we stopping?

232
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:18,574
We can't be there yet.

233
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:25,254
What's going on?

234
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:27,916
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:32,190
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:20:33,062 --> 00:20:34,996
There's something moving out there.

237
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:51,603
I think someone's coming aboard.

238
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:19,672
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:22:31,814 --> 00:22:33,213
Harry.

240
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:36,147
Harry, are you all right?

241
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:43,985
Thank you.

242
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,594
Here, eat this. It'll help.

243
00:22:48,097 --> 00:22:50,224
It's all right. It's chocolate.

244
00:22:56,538 --> 00:22:58,774
What was that thing that came?

245
00:22:58,774 --> 00:23:02,377
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

246
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:05,247
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:23:05,247 --> 00:23:08,876
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:16,390
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:23:22,197 --> 00:23:23,699
What happened to me?

250
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:25,601
Well, you sort of went rigid.

251
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,764
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,508
And did either of you two...

253
00:23:32,508 --> 00:23:34,009
...you know...

254
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:37,246
-...pass out?
-No.

255
00:23:37,246 --> 00:23:39,114
I felt weird, though.

256
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:40,945
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:23:42,217 --> 00:23:44,586
But someone was screaming.

258
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:45,951
A woman.

259
00:23:46,922 --> 00:23:48,913
No one was screaming, Harry.

260
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:52,187
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:24:52,187 --> 00:24:54,389
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

262
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:58,894
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:24:58,894 --> 00:25:02,364
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

264
00:25:02,364 --> 00:25:05,000
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

265
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,636
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:10,161
Good luck, professor.

267
00:25:14,776 --> 00:25:18,280
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,942
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

269
00:25:21,783 --> 00:25:24,953
-I mean, you actually fainted?
-Shove off, Malfoy.

270
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:27,122
-How did he find out?
-Just forget it.

271
00:25:27,122 --> 00:25:29,691
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

272
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:31,760
...has decided to retire...

273
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,697
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:25:35,697 --> 00:25:38,567
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

275
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:41,570
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

276
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:45,904
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:25:57,185 --> 00:26:00,188
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

278
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:02,891
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:08,056
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

280
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,188
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:26:13,168 --> 00:26:17,005
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:18,840
Now whilst I've been assured...

283
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,678
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

284
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:24,212
...a word of caution.

285
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:27,549
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

286
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:31,119
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,923
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

288
00:26:34,923 --> 00:26:38,552
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:26:39,328 --> 00:26:44,425
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:26:46,568 --> 00:26:50,038
But you know,
happiness can be found...

291
00:26:50,038 --> 00:26:53,633
...even in the darkest of times...

292
00:26:54,876 --> 00:26:58,744
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:12,750
Fortuna Major.

294
00:27:15,597 --> 00:27:18,467
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:21,570
-Fortuna Major.
-No, no. Wait, wait.

296
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,401
Watch this.

297
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:39,321
-Amazing. Just with my voice.
-Fortuna Major.

298
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:42,882
-Yes, all right. Go in.
-Thank you.

299
00:27:44,893 --> 00:27:47,028
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:27:47,028 --> 00:27:49,189
-She can't even sing.
-Exactly.

301
00:27:50,432 --> 00:27:52,593
-Hey, man.
-Hey, man.

302
00:27:53,635 --> 00:27:55,000
-Oh, God.
-That's awful.

303
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:58,132
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:27:59,941 --> 00:28:02,778
-What is that?
-You call that a monkey?

305
00:28:02,778 --> 00:28:05,147
Do not give him one again.

306
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:07,775
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:16,619
-Ron, catch.
-I will.

308
00:28:22,297 --> 00:28:23,924
I think we have a winner.

309
00:28:24,866 --> 00:28:27,198
-Oh, don't try one of them.
-Oh, no.

310
00:28:27,836 --> 00:28:30,327
Look at him. His face.

311
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:16,418
Welcome, my children.

312
00:29:16,418 --> 00:29:21,690
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,992
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:32,534
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:29:32,534 --> 00:29:37,372
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:29:37,372 --> 00:29:41,376
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:29:41,376 --> 00:29:44,937
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:47,015
What do you see?

319
00:29:47,015 --> 00:29:52,888
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:55,457
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:29:55,457 --> 00:30:00,161
-First, you must look beyond.
-What a load of rubbish.

322
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:02,264
-Where did you come from?
-Me?

323
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:05,100
-I've been here all this time.
-You, boy....

324
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:07,398
Is your grandmother quite well?

325
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:09,671
I think so.

326
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:12,469
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:30:15,477 --> 00:30:17,078
Pity.

328
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:19,672
Broaden your minds.

329
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:26,788
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:30:26,788 --> 00:30:28,924
-I think you are.
-Sure.

331
00:30:28,924 --> 00:30:31,293
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:32,988
Yeah.

333
00:30:33,828 --> 00:30:38,700
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,571
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

335
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:44,072
So...

336
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:48,310
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,641
Give me the cup.

338
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:54,113
Oh, my dear boy.

339
00:30:56,184 --> 00:30:57,845
My dear...

340
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,615
...you have the Grim.

341
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:05,360
The Grin? What's the Grin?

342
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,396
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:31:08,396 --> 00:31:10,799
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

344
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,233
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:15,637
It's an omen...

346
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:17,468
...of death."

347
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:26,014
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

348
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:30,118
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

349
00:31:30,118 --> 00:31:33,922
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

350
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:37,225
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

351
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:39,060
A fair few.

352
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:41,329
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:44,265
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:46,434
You have to be in two
classes at once.

355
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:50,005
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

356
00:31:50,005 --> 00:31:54,237
" Broaden your minds. Use your
lnner Eye to see the future."

357
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:59,547
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

358
00:31:59,547 --> 00:32:01,549
I got a real treat for you today.

359
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:03,540
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:32:14,796 --> 00:32:18,066
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,735
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:32:20,735 --> 00:32:22,570
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,438
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:32:35,817 --> 00:32:39,617
-Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
-I'm okay. Okay.

365
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:46,728
-I think they're funny.
-Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:32:46,728 --> 00:32:49,397
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:53,060
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

368
00:32:54,002 --> 00:32:55,333
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:11,910
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:33:19,894 --> 00:33:23,164
-Just ignore him.
-You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:24,631
Yeah.

372
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:38,012
Isn't he beautiful?

373
00:33:38,012 --> 00:33:40,640
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:33:41,249 --> 00:33:43,685
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

375
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:45,887
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:49,624
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:53,661
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:56,564
It may be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:33:56,564 --> 00:33:59,965
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:34:02,504 --> 00:34:04,563
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:34:07,375 --> 00:34:08,774
Come on now.

382
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,845
Now...

383
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:14,716
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

384
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:16,818
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:34:16,818 --> 00:34:19,387
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,689
If he does, you can go and touch him.

387
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:24,886
If not-- Well,
we'll get to that later.

388
00:34:27,562 --> 00:34:29,587
Just make your bow.

389
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,860
Nice and low.

390
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:39,867
Back off, Harry. Back off.

391
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:43,233
Keep still.

392
00:34:44,913 --> 00:34:46,904
Keep still.

393
00:34:55,089 --> 00:34:59,526
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

394
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:04,766
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:35:04,766 --> 00:35:06,597
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:17,477
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:22,248
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:35:27,355 --> 00:35:30,792
Slow down, Harry. That's it....

399
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,955
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:38,399
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly....

401
00:35:38,399 --> 00:35:40,162
That's it....

402
00:35:40,802 --> 00:35:42,133
Yes!

403
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:46,307
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:48,509
Does he get to fly?

405
00:35:48,509 --> 00:35:51,112
-I think he may let you ride him now.
-What?

406
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:52,814
-Come on.
-Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:35:52,814 --> 00:35:55,977
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:35:56,651 --> 00:36:01,020
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:45,693
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:47,795
That was wicked, Harry!

411
00:37:47,795 --> 00:37:49,194
Oh, please.

412
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:52,296
Well done, well done.

413
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:56,198
-How am I doing me first day?
-Brilliant, professor.

414
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:04,045
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

415
00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:05,410
Malfoy, no....

416
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:07,781
No!

417
00:38:08,516 --> 00:38:10,318
Buckbeak!

418
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:12,445
Whoa, whoa, whoa....

419
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:15,418
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:38:16,557 --> 00:38:19,093
Away, you silly creature....

421
00:38:19,093 --> 00:38:22,397
-It's killed me!
-Calm down. It's just a scratch!

422
00:38:22,397 --> 00:38:23,765
Hagrid!

423
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:28,964
-He has to be taken to the hospital.
-I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,076
-You're gonna regret this.
-Class dismissed!

425
00:38:35,076 --> 00:38:37,340
You and your bloody chicken!

426
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:03,104
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

427
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:07,108
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

428
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:10,778
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

429
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:13,881
-I can't do homework for weeks.
-Listen to the idiot.

430
00:39:13,881 --> 00:39:18,352
-He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
-At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

431
00:39:18,352 --> 00:39:22,290
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,325
-He's been sighted!
-Who?

433
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:26,020
Sirius Black!

434
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:30,498
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

435
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:33,301
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

436
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:35,970
-With dementors at every entrance?
-Dementors?

437
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,507
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:44,035
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:48,009
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:16,201
Intriguing, isn't it?

441
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:22,383
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

442
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:24,385
...as to what is inside?

443
00:40:24,385 --> 00:40:28,378
-That's a boggart, that is.
-Very good, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:40:29,157 --> 00:40:32,260
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,529
-No one knows.
-When did she get here?

446
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:36,230
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,667
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:44,272
-That's what makes them so--
-So terrifying, yes, yes, yes....

449
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:49,733
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:40:51,112 --> 00:40:55,183
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

451
00:40:55,183 --> 00:40:57,885
After me. Riddikulus!

452
00:40:57,885 --> 00:41:00,221
-Riddikulus!
-Very good.

453
00:41:00,221 --> 00:41:02,924
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:41:02,924 --> 00:41:05,326
-Riddikulus!
-Riddikulus!

455
00:41:05,326 --> 00:41:07,628
-This class is ridiculous.
-Very good.

456
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:11,832
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:41:11,832 --> 00:41:15,770
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:20,341
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:24,712
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:41:24,712 --> 00:41:27,010
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:30,151
Come on.

462
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:33,854
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:41:33,854 --> 00:41:35,756
Professor Snape.

464
00:41:35,756 --> 00:41:37,758
-Sorry?
-Professor Snape.

465
00:41:37,758 --> 00:41:41,329
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,823
-You live with your grandmother.
-I don't want it to turn into her, either.

467
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:47,926
No...

468
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:51,806
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:55,243
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:58,479
-She carries a red handbag--
-We don't need to hear.

471
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:02,550
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

472
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,320
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,457
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:42:09,457 --> 00:42:11,152
Can you do that?

475
00:42:11,759 --> 00:42:14,795
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:18,287
One, two, three.

477
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:29,975
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:34,772
Riddikulus!

479
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,189
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:42:42,189 --> 00:42:45,090
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line....

481
00:42:51,332 --> 00:42:52,833
Form a line!

482
00:42:52,833 --> 00:42:56,437
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:42:56,437 --> 00:42:59,740
...and turn it into something funny.

484
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,435
Next! Ron!

485
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:08,206
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:21,218
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:43:21,962 --> 00:43:23,964
Riddikulus!

488
00:43:23,964 --> 00:43:25,329
Yes!

489
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:28,834
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:43:29,337 --> 00:43:35,139
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:43:36,944 --> 00:43:39,139
Show us what you see.

492
00:43:48,422 --> 00:43:51,992
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:43:51,992 --> 00:43:53,960
Riddikulus!

494
00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:56,963
And next! Step up, step up!

495
00:43:58,065 --> 00:43:59,896
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:44:13,914 --> 00:44:16,007
Here!

497
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:23,686
Riddikulus!

498
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,302
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:44:35,302 --> 00:44:37,471
Collect your books from the back.

500
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:40,274
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:44:40,274 --> 00:44:43,300
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:44:45,312 --> 00:44:50,184
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:44:50,184 --> 00:44:53,187
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

504
00:44:53,187 --> 00:44:56,557
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:44:56,557 --> 00:45:00,027
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:45:00,027 --> 00:45:01,796
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:45:01,796 --> 00:45:05,166
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,835
I thought if you signed it,
then I could--

509
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:10,504
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:45:10,504 --> 00:45:13,701
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:20,572
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:45:21,816 --> 00:45:25,047
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:41,101
Professor, can I ask you something?

514
00:45:41,101 --> 00:45:45,172
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:45:45,172 --> 00:45:46,740
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,743
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:45:49,743 --> 00:45:53,481
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:45:53,481 --> 00:45:56,250
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,986
-...and the dementor.
-I'm very impressed.

520
00:45:58,986 --> 00:46:02,022
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:03,691
This is very wise.

522
00:46:03,691 --> 00:46:06,026
Before I fainted...

523
00:46:06,026 --> 00:46:08,017
...I heard something.

524
00:46:08,562 --> 00:46:10,631
A woman...

525
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:12,199
...screaming.

526
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:15,636
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:46:15,636 --> 00:46:18,571
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:46:19,406 --> 00:46:21,775
I think it was my mother...

529
00:46:21,775 --> 00:46:24,005
...the night she was murdered.

530
00:46:25,613 --> 00:46:30,073
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:33,921
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:36,082
They're your mother, Lily's.

533
00:46:37,024 --> 00:46:38,792
Yes.

534
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,784
Oh, yes. I knew her.

535
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:48,168
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:46:48,168 --> 00:46:51,572
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:46:51,572 --> 00:46:54,905
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:58,646
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:46:58,646 --> 00:47:04,812
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:47:06,287 --> 00:47:09,156
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

541
00:47:09,156 --> 00:47:10,680
...he....

542
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:14,558
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:22,325
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,309
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:47:30,144 --> 00:47:33,272
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:47:36,884 --> 00:47:41,489
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:44,191
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:47:44,191 --> 00:47:48,252
-You heard it's the most--
-Haunted building in Britain. I know.

549
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,298
What's going on?

550
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:53,901
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:47:53,901 --> 00:47:56,504
-Hey.
-Oh, you're there.

552
00:47:56,504 --> 00:48:00,804
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:04,278
Get back, all of you.

554
00:48:04,278 --> 00:48:07,581
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:48:07,581 --> 00:48:08,912
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:13,654
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:48:13,654 --> 00:48:15,554
It's not funny, Ron.

558
00:48:17,558 --> 00:48:21,654
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:29,170
-Be quiet.
-Make way.

560
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,405
-The headmaster's here.
-Come on, move.

561
00:48:31,405 --> 00:48:33,305
You heard. Move!

562
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:50,724
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:55,029
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:48:55,029 --> 00:48:58,089
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:48:58,933 --> 00:49:01,060
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:49:01,902 --> 00:49:03,893
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:49:04,471 --> 00:49:07,341
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:09,741
-Come back here!
-Keep moving!

569
00:49:13,347 --> 00:49:16,214
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:49:18,118 --> 00:49:23,146
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:27,261
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:29,964
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

573
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:32,366
Sirius Black!

574
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:37,463
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:50:05,532 --> 00:50:10,638
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:50:10,638 --> 00:50:13,407
-Thank you.
-The third floor's clear too, sir.

577
00:50:13,407 --> 00:50:15,509
-Very good.
-I've done the dungeons.

578
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:18,412
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:50:18,412 --> 00:50:20,903
I didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:50:22,149 --> 00:50:24,652
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

581
00:50:24,652 --> 00:50:27,121
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

582
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:29,990
-...completely undetected?
-Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,026
Any theories on how
he managed it?

584
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:35,229
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:36,964
You may recall...

586
00:50:36,964 --> 00:50:39,967
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

587
00:50:39,967 --> 00:50:42,202
...about your appointment
of Professor--

588
00:50:42,202 --> 00:50:46,473
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:50:46,473 --> 00:50:49,043
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...

590
00:50:49,043 --> 00:50:52,846
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:55,382
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:50:55,382 --> 00:50:58,010
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:50:58,886 --> 00:51:03,891
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:10,387
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:51:47,735 --> 00:51:51,068
Turn to page 394.

596
00:52:00,514 --> 00:52:04,075
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:52:04,785 --> 00:52:08,389
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:52:08,389 --> 00:52:12,459
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:52:12,459 --> 00:52:17,522
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:52:22,336 --> 00:52:24,338
"Werewolves"?

601
00:52:24,338 --> 00:52:27,341
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:52:27,341 --> 00:52:30,677
-We're not meant to start that for weeks.
-Quiet.

603
00:52:30,677 --> 00:52:33,840
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:52:34,481 --> 00:52:38,185
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:52:38,185 --> 00:52:40,619
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:43,255
No one?

607
00:52:43,757 --> 00:52:46,860
-How disappointing.
-Please, sir.

608
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:50,197
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:52:50,197 --> 00:52:52,166
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:54,068
With each full moon...

611
00:52:54,068 --> 00:52:58,138
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:52:58,138 --> 00:53:01,699
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:53:02,876 --> 00:53:05,813
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:53:05,813 --> 00:53:08,315
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:10,484
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:53:10,484 --> 00:53:14,121
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:17,724
-He's got a point, you know.
-Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:53:17,724 --> 00:53:22,529
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

619
00:53:22,529 --> 00:53:26,400
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

620
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,994
-...on recognizing it.
-It's Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:53:30,104 --> 00:53:33,640
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:37,878
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:53:37,878 --> 00:53:41,644
Page 394.

624
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:45,117
The term "werewolf"...

625
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:50,513
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word " wer"...

626
00:53:51,258 --> 00:53:55,695
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:58,899
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:53:58,899 --> 00:54:02,169
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:54:02,169 --> 00:54:04,069
...being bitten by a werewolf....

630
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:26,519
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

631
00:56:26,313 --> 00:56:29,146
Aresto momentum!

632
00:56:31,385 --> 00:56:34,688
-He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
-Peaky?

633
00:56:34,688 --> 00:56:37,157
What do you expect?
He fell over 1 00 feet.

634
00:56:37,157 --> 00:56:40,227
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:56:40,227 --> 00:56:43,287
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:56:46,933 --> 00:56:50,103
-How are you feeling?
-Oh, brilliant.

637
00:56:50,103 --> 00:56:52,339
You gave us a right good scare.

638
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:56,109
-What happened?
-Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:56:56,109 --> 00:56:58,441
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

640
00:57:02,883 --> 00:57:04,818
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:57:04,818 --> 00:57:08,855
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:57:08,855 --> 00:57:11,091
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

643
00:57:11,091 --> 00:57:14,754
There's something else
you should know too.

644
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:21,632
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and....

645
00:57:22,135 --> 00:57:23,625
Well....

646
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:27,507
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

647
00:57:27,507 --> 00:57:30,344
Is there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:31,878
No.

649
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:35,615
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:57:35,615 --> 00:57:38,885
-I mean, more than everyone else?
-Listen.

651
00:57:38,885 --> 00:57:42,255
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:57:42,255 --> 00:57:46,487
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

653
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:51,865
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:57:51,865 --> 00:57:56,236
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:57:56,236 --> 00:58:00,507
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:58:00,507 --> 00:58:04,077
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:58:04,077 --> 00:58:06,580
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,784
-I'm scared, professor.
-I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:58:10,784 --> 00:58:14,454
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:58:14,454 --> 00:58:16,656
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:58:16,656 --> 00:58:18,692
There was only one that night.

662
00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:23,630
-But you made it go away.
-I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:28,769
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

664
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:32,606
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:58:32,606 --> 00:58:34,506
For now, I need to rest.

666
00:58:59,966 --> 00:59:04,232
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:59:19,853 --> 00:59:22,022
-Guys, let me go.
-Clever, Harry.

668
00:59:22,022 --> 00:59:25,091
-But not clever enough.
-We've got a better way.

669
00:59:25,091 --> 00:59:28,094
-I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
-We know.

670
00:59:28,094 --> 00:59:29,629
We'll get you there.

671
00:59:29,629 --> 00:59:32,365
-We'll show you a quicker way.
-lf you pipe down.

672
00:59:32,365 --> 00:59:35,960
-Bless him.
-Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't--

673
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:39,164
-Now, Harry.
-Come and join the big boys.

674
00:59:40,574 --> 00:59:42,976
What are you doing?!

675
00:59:42,976 --> 00:59:45,979
-What's this rubbish?
-"What's this rubbish? " he says.

676
00:59:45,979 --> 00:59:49,483
-It's the secret to our success.
-It's a wrench giving it to you--

677
00:59:49,483 --> 00:59:52,552
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:59:52,552 --> 00:59:54,488
George, if you will.

679
00:59:54,488 --> 00:59:57,753
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

680
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:05,398
" Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs...

681
01:00:05,398 --> 01:00:08,602
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

682
01:00:08,602 --> 01:00:10,866
We owe them so much.

683
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:18,411
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that--

684
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:21,314
-No. Is that really--?
-Dumbledore.

685
01:00:21,314 --> 01:00:22,482
-ln his study.
-Pacing.

686
01:00:22,482 --> 01:00:24,718
Does that a lot.

687
01:00:24,718 --> 01:00:26,753
-So this map shows--?
-Everyone.

688
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:28,922
-Where they are.
-What they're doing.

689
01:00:28,922 --> 01:00:30,223
-Every minute.
-Every day.

690
01:00:30,223 --> 01:00:33,393
-Brilliant! Where did you get it?
-From Filch's office.

691
01:00:33,393 --> 01:00:36,296
-First year.
-There are seven secret passageways...

692
01:00:36,296 --> 01:00:39,132
-...out of the castle.
-We'd recommend this one.

693
01:00:39,132 --> 01:00:42,469
-The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
-Leads you to Honeyduke's.

694
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:44,471
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
01:00:44,471 --> 01:00:48,074
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

696
01:00:48,074 --> 01:00:52,408
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

697
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,944
Now, how much do you want?

698
01:01:37,223 --> 01:01:39,157
Delicious.

699
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:51,404
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

700
01:01:51,404 --> 01:01:53,099
Twice.

701
01:01:53,807 --> 01:01:56,343
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
01:01:56,343 --> 01:01:58,345
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
01:01:58,345 --> 01:02:01,381
Actually, I'm fine here.

704
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:03,617
Well, well. Look who's here.

705
01:02:03,617 --> 01:02:06,119
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:10,624
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
01:02:10,624 --> 01:02:14,127
-Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
-Not very friendly.

708
01:02:14,127 --> 01:02:19,432
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
01:02:19,432 --> 01:02:23,036
-Hope you don't mean yourself.
-How dare you talk to me!

710
01:02:23,036 --> 01:02:25,027
You filthy little mudblood!

711
01:02:29,242 --> 01:02:30,766
Who is that?

712
01:02:37,017 --> 01:02:39,383
-Don't stand there! Do something!
-What?

713
01:02:59,205 --> 01:03:01,469
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:07,347
Get out of the way!

715
01:03:07,347 --> 01:03:09,115
Move!

716
01:03:09,115 --> 01:03:12,107
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:03:15,889 --> 01:03:17,991
Harry!

718
01:03:17,991 --> 01:03:22,052
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:03:23,229 --> 01:03:26,700
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

720
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,336
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:03:30,336 --> 01:03:34,474
-Aren't you?
-Sure. Along with his lnvisibility Cloak.

722
01:03:34,474 --> 01:03:37,210
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:03:37,210 --> 01:03:39,646
-Ron fancies her.
-That's not true!

724
01:03:39,646 --> 01:03:41,715
-Professor McGonagall!
-Cornelius!

725
01:03:41,715 --> 01:03:43,283
Allow me, minister.

726
01:03:43,283 --> 01:03:45,318
-Oh, Hagrid....
-Sorry about that.

727
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:48,455
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

728
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:52,492
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:03:52,492 --> 01:03:56,963
-...into my pub every other night!
-We have....

730
01:03:56,963 --> 01:04:00,500
-We have a killer on the loose.
-Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,136
And what would bring him here?

732
01:04:03,136 --> 01:04:07,474
-Harry Potter.
-Harry Potter?

733
01:04:07,474 --> 01:04:09,237
Come.

734
01:04:11,778 --> 01:04:13,769
Harry!

735
01:04:21,488 --> 01:04:26,159
-No underage wizards allowed in today!
-Shut the damn door!

736
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:28,394
-So rude.
-Thick heads.

737
01:04:28,394 --> 01:04:30,196
-Thick heads?!
-How dare they!

738
01:04:30,196 --> 01:04:33,359
-Who are they calling thick heads?
-Young whippersnappers!

739
01:04:34,134 --> 01:04:38,204
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:42,140
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

741
01:04:44,911 --> 01:04:46,880
Tell me what this is all about.

742
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,518
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death--

743
01:04:51,518 --> 01:04:54,387
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:58,424
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:04:58,424 --> 01:05:01,828
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

746
01:05:01,828 --> 01:05:05,431
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:05:05,431 --> 01:05:07,801
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy.

748
01:05:07,801 --> 01:05:10,203
-Always trailing after Black.
-I remember.

749
01:05:10,203 --> 01:05:12,205
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:05:12,205 --> 01:05:15,108
-What happened?
-Peter tried to warn the Potters...

751
01:05:15,108 --> 01:05:19,512
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:05:19,512 --> 01:05:23,550
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

753
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:25,711
He destroyed him!

754
01:05:26,352 --> 01:05:31,257
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:05:31,257 --> 01:05:34,460
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

756
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:37,897
-...but he's the reason they're dead.
-He wants to finish things.

757
01:05:37,897 --> 01:05:40,934
-I don't believe it.
-That's not the worst of it.

758
01:05:40,934 --> 01:05:44,904
-What could be worse?
-This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:05:44,904 --> 01:05:47,473
...and remains to this day...

760
01:05:47,473 --> 01:05:49,100
...Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:00,048
Ron, look!

762
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:08,352
-Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
-Merry Christmas.

763
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:48,630
Harry, what happened?

764
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:53,264
He was their friend...

765
01:06:53,773 --> 01:06:56,003
...and he betrayed them.

766
01:06:56,809 --> 01:06:58,777
He was their friend!

767
01:07:01,014 --> 01:07:02,982
I hope he finds me.

768
01:07:03,616 --> 01:07:06,419
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

769
01:07:06,419 --> 01:07:09,013
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

770
01:07:23,303 --> 01:07:24,930
Harry.

771
01:07:25,438 --> 01:07:27,473
There you are. You came.

772
01:07:27,473 --> 01:07:31,511
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

773
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:34,147
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:07:34,147 --> 01:07:35,671
I'm sure.

775
01:07:36,249 --> 01:07:38,985
Well, everything's prepared.

776
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:42,555
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:07:42,555 --> 01:07:44,190
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,025
No? Well....

779
01:07:46,025 --> 01:07:49,762
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

780
01:07:49,762 --> 01:07:54,600
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,604
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:07:58,604 --> 01:08:02,775
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

783
01:08:02,775 --> 01:08:06,575
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:10,010
Close your eyes.

785
01:08:11,784 --> 01:08:13,684
Concentrate.

786
01:08:14,921 --> 01:08:17,014
Explore your past.

787
01:08:17,523 --> 01:08:19,388
Do you have a memory?

788
01:08:20,994 --> 01:08:23,189
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:08:23,896 --> 01:08:26,299
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:08:26,299 --> 01:08:32,071
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.

791
01:08:32,071 --> 01:08:34,904
-Expecto Patronum.
-Very good.

792
01:08:38,711 --> 01:08:42,044
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:02,460
Expecto Patronum!

794
01:09:03,236 --> 01:09:06,839
Expecto.... Expecto....

795
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:08,568
Expect....

796
01:09:10,576 --> 01:09:14,947
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:09:14,947 --> 01:09:19,152
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:09:19,152 --> 01:09:24,283
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:09:25,124 --> 01:09:28,194
-That's one nasty dementor.
-Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:09:28,194 --> 01:09:31,130
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:34,467
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

802
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:37,270
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

803
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:40,967
-Which memory did you choose?
-The first time I rode a broom.

804
01:09:42,175 --> 01:09:45,508
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:09:52,385 --> 01:09:57,652
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

806
01:09:59,592 --> 01:10:01,861
Well, it is.

807
01:10:01,861 --> 01:10:04,630
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

808
01:10:04,630 --> 01:10:08,589
-...but it's complicated.
-ls it strong?

809
01:10:12,972 --> 01:10:15,805
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?

810
01:10:17,610 --> 01:10:19,339
Just do it.

811
01:10:29,388 --> 01:10:32,653
Expecto Patronum!

812
01:10:33,893 --> 01:10:37,852
Expecto Patronum!

813
01:10:59,452 --> 01:11:00,544
Yes!

814
01:11:02,522 --> 01:11:05,923
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:11:06,459 --> 01:11:10,763
-I think I've had enough for today.
-Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:11:10,763 --> 01:11:13,366
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

817
01:11:13,366 --> 01:11:15,301
And just so you know, Harry...

818
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:19,472
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:11:19,472 --> 01:11:21,531
...is saying something.

820
01:11:23,709 --> 01:11:25,878
I was thinking of him.

821
01:11:25,878 --> 01:11:28,214
And Mum.

822
01:11:28,214 --> 01:11:30,444
Seeing their faces.

823
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:33,953
They were talking to me.

824
01:11:33,953 --> 01:11:36,389
Just talking.

825
01:11:36,389 --> 01:11:38,721
That's the memory I chose.

826
01:11:40,326 --> 01:11:42,794
I don't even know if it's real.

827
01:11:43,296 --> 01:11:45,457
But it's the best I have.

828
01:11:54,707 --> 01:11:57,210
-Beautiful day.
-Gorgeous.

829
01:11:57,210 --> 01:11:59,345
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:11:59,345 --> 01:12:01,948
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:12:01,948 --> 01:12:05,284
-Ronald has lost his rat.
-I haven't lost anything!

832
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:07,587
-Your cat killed him!
-Rubbish.

833
01:12:07,587 --> 01:12:11,090
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

834
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:15,161
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:12:15,161 --> 01:12:18,231
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

836
01:12:18,231 --> 01:12:20,466
-Your cat killed him!
-Did not.

837
01:12:20,466 --> 01:12:21,956
-Did.
-Didn't.

838
01:12:24,003 --> 01:12:26,806
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:12:26,806 --> 01:12:30,276
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

840
01:12:30,276 --> 01:12:32,938
...talking about why we were there.

841
01:12:34,814 --> 01:12:37,650
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

842
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:40,820
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:44,023
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

844
01:12:44,023 --> 01:12:47,393
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

845
01:12:47,393 --> 01:12:50,663
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:12:50,663 --> 01:12:52,460
And then?

847
01:12:53,165 --> 01:12:56,035
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

848
01:12:56,035 --> 01:13:00,165
-They're not sacking you!
-No, I'm not sacked.

849
01:13:02,275 --> 01:13:05,267
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

850
01:13:32,138 --> 01:13:37,877
Spiders! There's-- There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:13:37,877 --> 01:13:40,613
-I don't wanna tap-dance!
-You tell those spiders.

852
01:13:40,613 --> 01:13:44,572
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them....

853
01:14:02,735 --> 01:14:05,071
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy.

854
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:08,407
-Always trailing after Sirius Black.
-Black was vicious.

855
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:10,875
He didn 't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

856
01:14:18,951 --> 01:14:22,409
-Put that light out!
-Sorry.

857
01:15:05,664 --> 01:15:09,794
-Watch it there, boy.
-We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:20,604
Mischief managed. Nox.

859
01:15:22,815 --> 01:15:24,316
Potter.

860
01:15:24,316 --> 01:15:27,987
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

861
01:15:27,987 --> 01:15:29,221
I was sleepwalking.

862
01:15:29,221 --> 01:15:32,024
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

863
01:15:32,024 --> 01:15:36,996
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

864
01:15:36,996 --> 01:15:41,330
My dad didn't strut. And nor do l.

865
01:15:42,067 --> 01:15:45,127
Now, if you don't mind, I would
appreciate it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:15:48,703 --> 01:15:50,534
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:15:52,206 --> 01:15:54,834
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:15:57,745 --> 01:15:59,547
What's this?

869
01:15:59,547 --> 01:16:02,812
-Spare bit of parchment.
-Really? Open it.

870
01:16:09,390 --> 01:16:12,985
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,331
Read it.

872
01:16:20,768 --> 01:16:26,474
" Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

873
01:16:26,474 --> 01:16:30,878
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and...."

874
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:32,368
Go on.

875
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:37,618
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

876
01:16:37,618 --> 01:16:40,178
-You insolent little--
-Professor!

877
01:16:41,789 --> 01:16:44,692
Well, well. Lupin.

878
01:16:44,692 --> 01:16:49,391
Out for a little walk in the moonlight,
are we?

879
01:16:50,765 --> 01:16:53,401
Harry, are you all right?

880
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:55,869
That remains to be seen.

881
01:16:56,704 --> 01:17:00,608
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:17:00,608 --> 01:17:04,312
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:17:04,312 --> 01:17:09,283
-Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
-I seriously doubt it, Severus.

884
01:17:09,283 --> 01:17:12,954
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

885
01:17:12,954 --> 01:17:17,025
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:17:17,025 --> 01:17:21,429
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:17:21,429 --> 01:17:24,732
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

888
01:17:24,732 --> 01:17:28,065
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

889
01:17:34,075 --> 01:17:36,805
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:17:41,916 --> 01:17:43,349
Come in.

891
01:17:45,153 --> 01:17:50,558
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

892
01:17:50,558 --> 01:17:55,196
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:17:55,196 --> 01:17:59,067
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

894
01:17:59,067 --> 01:18:01,058
...is a map to you?

895
01:18:01,869 --> 01:18:04,337
-No.
-No, sir.

896
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:09,577
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:18:09,577 --> 01:18:13,877
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:18:14,515 --> 01:18:18,786
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

899
01:18:18,786 --> 01:18:23,458
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

900
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:25,793
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

901
01:18:25,793 --> 01:18:28,396
-Do you hear me?
-Yes, sir.

902
01:18:28,396 --> 01:18:32,233
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

903
01:18:32,233 --> 01:18:37,000
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

904
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:46,113
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

905
01:18:46,981 --> 01:18:52,353
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

906
01:18:52,353 --> 01:18:55,256
Oh, really? And who might that be?

907
01:18:55,256 --> 01:18:56,814
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:18:59,427 --> 01:19:01,520
That's not possible.

909
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:04,391
It's just what I saw.

910
01:19:07,235 --> 01:19:08,930
Good night, professor.

911
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:16,777
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:19:16,777 --> 01:19:22,383
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the lnner Eye.

913
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:25,716
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:19:26,254 --> 01:19:28,347
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:19:30,691 --> 01:19:32,886
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:19:35,296 --> 01:19:38,265
The Grim, possibly.

917
01:19:40,434 --> 01:19:44,705
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

918
01:19:44,705 --> 01:19:48,676
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

919
01:19:48,676 --> 01:19:52,747
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

920
01:19:52,747 --> 01:19:56,584
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

921
01:19:56,584 --> 01:20:00,755
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

922
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:03,883
...to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:20:19,407 --> 01:20:21,398
Have I said something?

924
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:31,252
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

925
01:20:31,252 --> 01:20:33,988
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:20:33,988 --> 01:20:36,357
Hang on.

927
01:20:36,357 --> 01:20:39,594
-We better take this back.
-I'm not going back.

928
01:20:39,594 --> 01:20:42,995
-Fine. See you later.
-See you.

929
01:21:20,768 --> 01:21:26,035
Harry Potter....

930
01:21:32,913 --> 01:21:37,351
-Professor Trelawney--
-He will return tonight.

931
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:39,186
Sorry?

932
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:43,991
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:21:43,991 --> 01:21:46,193
...shall break free.

934
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:48,596
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

935
01:21:48,596 --> 01:21:54,592
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:22:00,941 --> 01:22:04,206
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:22:05,012 --> 01:22:07,248
No.

938
01:22:07,248 --> 01:22:08,806
Nothing.

939
01:23:01,402 --> 01:23:05,606
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

940
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:08,509
-lt just got worse.
-What did I say? Father said...

941
01:23:08,509 --> 01:23:12,880
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

942
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:15,516
This is going to be rich.

943
01:23:15,516 --> 01:23:17,885
-Look who's here.
-Come to see the show?

944
01:23:17,885 --> 01:23:21,155
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

945
01:23:21,155 --> 01:23:22,918
Hermione, no!

946
01:23:23,491 --> 01:23:25,755
He's not worth it.

947
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,109
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:23:42,109 --> 01:23:46,480
-Let's go. Quick.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?

949
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,917
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant.

950
01:24:10,337 --> 01:24:14,809
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:24:14,809 --> 01:24:17,244
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:24:17,244 --> 01:24:19,847
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

953
01:24:19,847 --> 01:24:23,017
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

954
01:24:23,017 --> 01:24:25,383
Says he wants to be with me
when they....

955
01:24:26,387 --> 01:24:28,589
When it happens.

956
01:24:28,589 --> 01:24:29,954
Great man, Dumbledore.

957
01:24:30,958 --> 01:24:32,482
A great man.

958
01:24:34,962 --> 01:24:38,098
-We'll stay with you too.
-You'll do no such thing!

959
01:24:38,098 --> 01:24:41,469
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:24:41,469 --> 01:24:45,098
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron....

961
01:24:52,546 --> 01:24:55,082
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:24:55,082 --> 01:24:58,986
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-I think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:24:58,986 --> 01:25:02,890
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

964
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:03,982
I meant me!

965
01:25:04,692 --> 01:25:06,887
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:25:13,367 --> 01:25:14,766
Hagrid!

967
01:25:16,704 --> 01:25:18,035
Oh, crikey.

968
01:25:19,507 --> 01:25:22,443
No, minister. Over this way.

969
01:25:22,443 --> 01:25:26,714
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:25:26,714 --> 01:25:30,651
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

971
01:25:30,651 --> 01:25:34,246
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:25:35,656 --> 01:25:38,259
Quick. Quick!

973
01:25:38,259 --> 01:25:40,160
Hagrid.

974
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:44,096
-lt'll be fine. It'll be okay.
-Go on, go on!

975
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:48,903
-That's ling you see over there--
-On the slope.

976
01:25:48,903 --> 01:25:51,739
-On the slope-- Ah, Hagrid.
-Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:25:51,739 --> 01:25:54,642
-Good evening.
-Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:25:54,642 --> 01:25:58,476
-Have a tea, if you like.
-No, Hagrid.

979
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:03,350
-Gentlemen.
-I'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:06,683
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

981
01:26:07,855 --> 01:26:11,625
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

982
01:26:11,625 --> 01:26:14,962
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

983
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:20,634
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:24,371
-Dear, dear....
-Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

985
01:26:24,371 --> 01:26:28,943
-All right. It'll be all right.
-The execution shall dispatch--

986
01:26:28,943 --> 01:26:30,844
What?

987
01:26:30,844 --> 01:26:33,113
I thought I just saw--

988
01:26:33,113 --> 01:26:35,206
-Never mind.
-Let's go!

989
01:26:40,321 --> 01:26:42,653
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

990
01:27:29,169 --> 01:27:30,636
Oh, no.

991
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,743
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:27:44,351 --> 01:27:46,285
Ron. Ron!

993
01:27:47,254 --> 01:27:50,781
-Ron!
-Scabbers, come back.

994
01:27:52,292 --> 01:27:54,055
Wait!

995
01:27:59,967 --> 01:28:04,438
-Scabbers, you bit me!
-Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:28:04,438 --> 01:28:06,736
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:28:09,877 --> 01:28:12,402
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,607
It's the Grim!

999
01:28:21,622 --> 01:28:24,892
-Harry!
-Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:28:24,892 --> 01:28:26,883
Harry!

1001
01:28:28,462 --> 01:28:30,828
-Help!
-Ron!

1002
01:28:32,966 --> 01:28:36,231
-Ron. Ron.
-Ron!

1003
01:28:51,085 --> 01:28:53,076
Come on!

1004
01:28:54,988 --> 01:28:56,421
Move!

1005
01:29:00,461 --> 01:29:02,224
Duck!

1006
01:29:38,065 --> 01:29:40,363
Harry!

1007
01:29:56,283 --> 01:29:59,419
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

1008
01:29:59,419 --> 01:30:03,355
-Where do you suppose this goes?
-I have a hunch.

1009
01:30:03,891 --> 01:30:05,381
I just hope I'm wrong.

1010
01:30:25,078 --> 01:30:28,241
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1011
01:30:29,349 --> 01:30:30,941
Come on.

1012
01:30:41,328 --> 01:30:42,727
Ron.

1013
01:30:43,263 --> 01:30:46,099
-Ron. You're okay.
-The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:30:46,099 --> 01:30:49,330
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1015
01:31:03,217 --> 01:31:06,153
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:31:06,153 --> 01:31:08,155
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:31:08,155 --> 01:31:10,089
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:31:16,296 --> 01:31:18,457
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:31:19,666 --> 01:31:21,497
Expelliarmus!

1020
01:31:25,239 --> 01:31:29,610
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1021
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:32,636
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:31:33,247 --> 01:31:36,876
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1023
01:31:47,294 --> 01:31:48,462
-I found him.
-I know.

1024
01:31:48,462 --> 01:31:49,963
-He's here.
-I understand.

1025
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:53,600
-Let's kill him!
-No! I trusted you!

1026
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,331
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1027
01:31:58,038 --> 01:32:01,098
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1028
01:32:03,911 --> 01:32:05,606
How long have you known?

1029
01:32:06,113 --> 01:32:09,516
-Since Professor Snape set the essay.
-Well, Hermione.

1030
01:32:09,516 --> 01:32:12,619
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1031
01:32:12,619 --> 01:32:15,222
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1032
01:32:15,222 --> 01:32:18,025
-Wait!
-I did my waiting!

1033
01:32:18,025 --> 01:32:20,459
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:32:21,061 --> 01:32:23,461
In Azkaban!

1035
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:34,669
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:32:35,242 --> 01:32:39,179
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:40,981
I know why.

1038
01:32:40,981 --> 01:32:43,383
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:32:43,383 --> 01:32:46,486
-You're the reason they're dead!
-No, it wasn't him.

1040
01:32:46,486 --> 01:32:48,555
Somebody did betray your parents...

1041
01:32:48,555 --> 01:32:52,259
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1042
01:32:52,259 --> 01:32:55,896
-Who was it, then?
-Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:32:55,896 --> 01:32:59,024
And he's in this room! Right now!

1044
01:32:59,533 --> 01:33:02,669
Come out, come out, Peter!

1045
01:33:02,669 --> 01:33:05,661
-Come out, come out and play!
-Expelliarmus!

1046
01:33:08,608 --> 01:33:11,278
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:33:11,278 --> 01:33:13,714
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:15,215
Severus--

1049
01:33:15,215 --> 01:33:20,120
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1050
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:21,621
Brilliant, Snape.

1051
01:33:21,621 --> 01:33:26,226
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:29,062
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1053
01:33:29,062 --> 01:33:34,234
-...to attend to.
-Give me a reason. I beg you!

1054
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:37,037
-Don't be a fool.
-He can't help it. It's habit.

1055
01:33:37,037 --> 01:33:38,772
-Be quiet.
-Be quiet yourself!

1056
01:33:38,772 --> 01:33:41,375
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:43,900
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1058
01:33:44,444 --> 01:33:47,414
I could do it, you know.

1059
01:33:47,414 --> 01:33:53,220
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:33:53,220 --> 01:33:56,089
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,760
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1062
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:05,399
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1063
01:34:05,399 --> 01:34:07,629
Severus, please.

1064
01:34:08,668 --> 01:34:10,659
After you.

1065
01:34:15,011 --> 01:34:16,740
Expelliarmus!

1066
01:34:18,515 --> 01:34:22,319
-Harry! What did you just do?
-You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:25,055
-Tell me about Peter.
-He was at school with us.

1068
01:34:25,055 --> 01:34:26,890
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:30,060
-No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
-No, he didn't.

1070
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:33,496
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:34:33,496 --> 01:34:36,466
-The map was lying, then.
-The map never lies!

1072
01:34:36,466 --> 01:34:40,904
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1073
01:34:40,904 --> 01:34:45,775
-Me?! He's mental!
-Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:34:45,775 --> 01:34:49,079
-Scabbers has been in my family for--
-Twelve years?

1075
01:34:49,079 --> 01:34:51,748
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:34:51,748 --> 01:34:54,517
-He's missing a toe, isn't he?
-So what?

1077
01:34:54,517 --> 01:34:57,687
-All they could find of Pettigrew was his--
-Finger!

1078
01:34:57,687 --> 01:35:01,091
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:35:01,091 --> 01:35:04,117
-And then he transformed into a rat!
-Show me.

1080
01:35:06,730 --> 01:35:10,000
-Give it to him, Ron.
-What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,234
Scabbers!

1082
01:35:11,234 --> 01:35:14,294
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:35:36,793 --> 01:35:38,624
Remus?

1084
01:35:39,396 --> 01:35:41,064
Sirius.

1085
01:35:41,064 --> 01:35:42,964
My old friends!

1086
01:35:48,605 --> 01:35:52,609
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:35:52,609 --> 01:35:56,272
-James. We were the best of friends--
-How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:35:57,113 --> 01:35:59,949
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:35:59,949 --> 01:36:05,321
-You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
-I didn't mean to!

1090
01:36:05,321 --> 01:36:08,358
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1091
01:36:08,358 --> 01:36:11,361
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:36:11,361 --> 01:36:16,958
-What would you have done?
-Died, rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:36:19,135 --> 01:36:21,704
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:36:21,704 --> 01:36:27,370
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:36:27,877 --> 01:36:32,282
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1096
01:36:32,282 --> 01:36:34,307
No!

1097
01:36:35,819 --> 01:36:39,956
-Harry, this man--
-I know what he is.

1098
01:36:39,956 --> 01:36:42,025
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:36:42,025 --> 01:36:47,088
-Bless you, boy. Bless you!
-Get off!

1100
01:36:48,231 --> 01:36:51,000
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1101
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,195
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:01,044
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:37:01,044 --> 01:37:04,747
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:37:04,747 --> 01:37:06,483
I was going for the rat.

1105
01:37:06,483 --> 01:37:10,487
Normally, I have a very
sweet disposition as a dog.

1106
01:37:10,487 --> 01:37:15,892
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:37:15,892 --> 01:37:20,761
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1108
01:37:33,343 --> 01:37:34,833
Okay.

1109
01:37:39,849 --> 01:37:42,552
-You better go.
-No. Don't worry, okay?

1110
01:37:42,552 --> 01:37:43,951
It's fine. I'll stay.

1111
01:37:44,721 --> 01:37:47,023
You go, I'll stay.

1112
01:37:47,023 --> 01:37:50,151
-You okay?
-I'm fine. Go.

1113
01:37:51,728 --> 01:37:54,898
-That looks really painful.
-So painful.

1114
01:37:54,898 --> 01:37:57,934
They might chop it.

1115
01:37:57,934 --> 01:38:00,770
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:04,968
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:38:06,242 --> 01:38:08,073
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1118
01:38:08,912 --> 01:38:12,678
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1119
01:38:13,383 --> 01:38:16,546
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:38:18,688 --> 01:38:21,486
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:38:22,292 --> 01:38:24,627
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:38:24,627 --> 01:38:27,964
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1123
01:38:27,964 --> 01:38:29,699
...to become killers.

1124
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:33,570
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:38:33,570 --> 01:38:36,105
Alive, you're free.

1126
01:38:36,105 --> 01:38:39,409
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:38:39,409 --> 01:38:42,912
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:38:42,912 --> 01:38:45,582
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1129
01:38:45,582 --> 01:38:49,609
-Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't--
-Get away from her!

1130
01:38:52,088 --> 01:38:54,157
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1131
01:38:54,157 --> 01:38:58,428
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:38:58,428 --> 01:39:00,362
I know.

1133
01:39:01,531 --> 01:39:05,768
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1134
01:39:05,768 --> 01:39:08,438
...but if you ever wanted
a different home....

1135
01:39:08,438 --> 01:39:10,929
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:39:12,242 --> 01:39:15,545
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1137
01:39:15,545 --> 01:39:17,308
Harry!

1138
01:39:32,562 --> 01:39:36,259
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:39:37,567 --> 01:39:42,903
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1140
01:39:44,274 --> 01:39:46,265
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:49,503
Expelliarmus!

1142
01:39:59,589 --> 01:40:01,147
Harry!

1143
01:40:02,225 --> 01:40:05,194
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:40:11,401 --> 01:40:13,733
Run! Run!

1145
01:40:23,746 --> 01:40:25,948
-Come on.
-Wait. Wait.

1146
01:40:25,948 --> 01:40:31,220
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:40:31,220 --> 01:40:33,450
Professor?

1148
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,084
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:40:46,869 --> 01:40:50,540
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:40:50,540 --> 01:40:53,065
There you are, Potter!

1151
01:41:26,876 --> 01:41:27,900
Sirius!

1152
01:41:28,745 --> 01:41:31,145
Come back here, Potter!

1153
01:42:36,979 --> 01:42:38,378
Sirius!

1154
01:42:39,182 --> 01:42:42,151
No. Sirius!

1155
01:43:24,026 --> 01:43:26,893
Expecto Patronum!

1156
01:45:39,695 --> 01:45:42,061
Harry?

1157
01:45:42,999 --> 01:45:45,568
I saw my dad.

1158
01:45:45,568 --> 01:45:47,336
What?

1159
01:45:47,336 --> 01:45:49,038
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:45:49,038 --> 01:45:50,640
I saw him across the lake.

1161
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,508
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1162
01:45:52,508 --> 01:45:55,511
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:45:55,511 --> 01:45:58,214
-They're gonna kill him?
-No. It's worse.

1164
01:45:58,214 --> 01:46:00,216
Much worse.

1165
01:46:00,216 --> 01:46:02,582
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:46:04,286 --> 01:46:05,855
Headmaster, stop them.

1167
01:46:05,855 --> 01:46:09,392
-They've got the wrong man.
-It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:46:09,392 --> 01:46:11,761
-It's Scabbers who did it.
-Scabbers?

1169
01:46:11,761 --> 01:46:13,562
He's my rat, sir.

1170
01:46:13,562 --> 01:46:17,566
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1171
01:46:17,566 --> 01:46:21,437
-But then they gave him an owl--
-The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:46:21,437 --> 01:46:24,173
-Please believe us.
-I do, Miss Granger.

1173
01:46:24,173 --> 01:46:29,577
But the word of three 1 3-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:46:32,682 --> 01:46:35,618
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1175
01:46:35,618 --> 01:46:39,384
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:46:44,593 --> 01:46:47,118
Mysterious thing, time.

1177
01:46:48,297 --> 01:46:49,799
Powerful...

1178
01:46:49,799 --> 01:46:52,700
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1179
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:57,899
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:46:58,708 --> 01:47:00,976
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1181
01:47:00,976 --> 01:47:02,945
You must not be seen.

1182
01:47:02,945 --> 01:47:06,782
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:47:06,782 --> 01:47:10,309
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:47:10,853 --> 01:47:12,822
If you succeed tonight...

1185
01:47:12,822 --> 01:47:15,655
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:47:17,493 --> 01:47:19,723
Three turns should do it, I think.

1187
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:26,602
Oh, and by the way.

1188
01:47:26,602 --> 01:47:32,608
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:47:32,608 --> 01:47:34,667
Good luck.

1190
01:47:35,177 --> 01:47:37,645
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:47:38,314 --> 01:47:40,646
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk....

1192
01:48:09,645 --> 01:48:11,413
What just happened?

1193
01:48:11,413 --> 01:48:13,883
-Where's Ron?
-7:30.

1194
01:48:13,883 --> 01:48:15,918
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:48:15,918 --> 01:48:17,887
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:48:17,887 --> 01:48:20,287
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:48:21,357 --> 01:48:23,188
Hermione!

1198
01:48:41,377 --> 01:48:44,039
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:48:45,848 --> 01:48:49,618
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:48:49,618 --> 01:48:52,621
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:48:52,621 --> 01:48:54,190
That's us.

1202
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:57,326
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1203
01:48:57,326 --> 01:48:58,759
This is not normal.

1204
01:49:01,063 --> 01:49:03,599
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:49:03,599 --> 01:49:05,968
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:49:05,968 --> 01:49:09,538
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:49:09,538 --> 01:49:12,908
-You mean we've gone back in time?
-Yes.

1208
01:49:12,908 --> 01:49:16,275
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:49:18,581 --> 01:49:21,744
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:49:24,887 --> 01:49:26,388
Good punch.

1211
01:49:26,388 --> 01:49:27,878
Thanks.

1212
01:49:28,891 --> 01:49:30,552
Malfoy's coming.

1213
01:49:31,460 --> 01:49:34,263
-Run.
-Not a word to anyone, understood?

1214
01:49:34,263 --> 01:49:37,499
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:49:37,499 --> 01:49:41,435
-That felt good.
-Not good, brilliant.

1216
01:49:42,805 --> 01:49:45,399
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1217
01:50:04,526 --> 01:50:07,086
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1218
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:10,599
Of course.

1219
01:50:10,599 --> 01:50:12,768
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:50:12,768 --> 01:50:17,172
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:50:17,172 --> 01:50:18,503
Let's go.

1222
01:50:39,795 --> 01:50:42,064
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:50:42,064 --> 01:50:44,733
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:50:44,733 --> 01:50:47,201
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:50:48,237 --> 01:50:50,806
Scabbers, you're alive!

1226
01:50:50,806 --> 01:50:53,809
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-That's Pettigrew.

1227
01:50:53,809 --> 01:50:56,879
-Harry, you can't.
-He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:50:56,879 --> 01:50:59,871
-You don't expect me to sit here.
-Yes, and you must!

1229
01:51:03,752 --> 01:51:06,655
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1230
01:51:06,655 --> 01:51:09,658
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:51:09,658 --> 01:51:12,695
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1232
01:51:12,695 --> 01:51:14,959
We can't be seen.

1233
01:51:18,233 --> 01:51:19,962
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:51:20,869 --> 01:51:22,962
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:51:25,107 --> 01:51:26,699
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:51:37,619 --> 01:51:39,177
Are you mad?

1237
01:51:45,194 --> 01:51:46,762
That hurt.

1238
01:51:46,762 --> 01:51:48,093
Sorry.

1239
01:52:08,951 --> 01:52:11,613
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:52:29,038 --> 01:52:31,836
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:52:33,909 --> 01:52:35,240
What?

1242
01:52:36,111 --> 01:52:38,147
I thought I just saw....

1243
01:52:38,147 --> 01:52:40,809
-Never mind.
-Let's go.

1244
01:52:55,130 --> 01:52:57,428
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1245
01:53:03,672 --> 01:53:05,640
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:31,231
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1247
01:53:32,101 --> 01:53:35,471
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be....

1248
01:53:35,471 --> 01:53:39,237
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:53:43,712 --> 01:53:46,408
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1250
01:53:48,817 --> 01:53:52,617
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:53:53,422 --> 01:53:57,126
-Your name only.
-It's such a very long name....

1252
01:53:57,126 --> 01:53:58,821
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:54:01,530 --> 01:54:04,700
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:06,998
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:54:09,638 --> 01:54:14,343
-Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
-Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1256
01:54:14,343 --> 01:54:16,211
-Now, look there.
-Where?

1257
01:54:16,211 --> 01:54:19,748
-Look beyond the rocks.
-What am I supposed to see?

1258
01:54:19,748 --> 01:54:23,418
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:54:23,418 --> 01:54:26,251
-Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
-And all the strawberries.

1260
01:54:27,222 --> 01:54:30,259
-Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
-I see no strawberries.

1261
01:54:30,259 --> 01:54:31,593
-Over there.
-Where?

1262
01:54:31,593 --> 01:54:33,562
-Over there.
-This way.

1263
01:54:33,562 --> 01:54:36,224
-Let's get this over, please.
-All right.

1264
01:54:37,900 --> 01:54:39,595
But where is it?

1265
01:54:40,536 --> 01:54:42,731
I saw the beast, just now.

1266
01:54:43,372 --> 01:54:45,741
-Not a moment ago!
-How extraordinary.

1267
01:54:45,741 --> 01:54:47,276
Buckbeak.

1268
01:54:47,276 --> 01:54:51,547
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:54:51,547 --> 01:54:53,081
-Hagrid?
-Buckbeak.

1270
01:54:53,081 --> 01:54:57,553
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1271
01:54:57,553 --> 01:55:00,556
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:55:00,556 --> 01:55:02,591
-Right.
-Well, well....

1273
01:55:02,591 --> 01:55:04,293
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:55:04,293 --> 01:55:07,496
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1275
01:55:07,496 --> 01:55:13,101
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:17,272
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:55:17,272 --> 01:55:19,341
Thank you.

1278
01:55:19,341 --> 01:55:22,640
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1279
01:55:33,422 --> 01:55:34,912
-Come on.
-This way.

1280
01:55:41,730 --> 01:55:43,493
This way, now.

1281
01:55:45,934 --> 01:55:47,869
-Now what?
-We save Sirius.

1282
01:55:47,869 --> 01:55:50,360
-How?
-No idea.

1283
01:55:59,681 --> 01:56:02,047
-Look. It's Lupin.
-Immobulus!

1284
01:56:08,490 --> 01:56:10,481
And Snape's coming.

1285
01:56:16,698 --> 01:56:18,359
And now we wait.

1286
01:56:19,568 --> 01:56:21,365
And now we wait.

1287
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:52,195
-At least someone's enjoying himself.
-Yeah.

1288
01:56:55,003 --> 01:56:56,938
-Hermione?
-Yeah?

1289
01:56:56,938 --> 01:57:01,443
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:57:01,443 --> 01:57:03,745
...I did see someone.

1291
01:57:03,745 --> 01:57:07,349
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:57:07,349 --> 01:57:08,850
With a Patronus.

1293
01:57:08,850 --> 01:57:10,919
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:57:10,919 --> 01:57:12,554
According to him...

1295
01:57:12,554 --> 01:57:16,124
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:57:16,124 --> 01:57:18,024
It was my dad.

1297
01:57:19,127 --> 01:57:21,096
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:57:21,096 --> 01:57:23,360
-Harry, but your dad's--
-Dead. I know.

1299
01:57:24,766 --> 01:57:27,098
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:57:31,239 --> 01:57:32,866
Here we come.

1301
01:57:38,547 --> 01:57:41,083
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:57:41,083 --> 01:57:44,186
-He's asking me to come live with him.
-That's great.

1303
01:57:44,186 --> 01:57:47,589
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1304
01:57:47,589 --> 01:57:49,216
It'll just be me and him.

1305
01:57:49,891 --> 01:57:51,993
We could live in the country...

1306
01:57:51,993 --> 01:57:54,796
...someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:57:54,796 --> 01:57:57,629
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:57:58,667 --> 01:58:00,225
Harry!

1309
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:03,465
Run!

1310
01:58:10,379 --> 01:58:11,903
Let's go.

1311
01:58:31,466 --> 01:58:33,798
-What are you doing?
-Saving your life.

1312
01:58:38,039 --> 01:58:39,438
Thanks.

1313
01:58:41,276 --> 01:58:45,303
-Great. Now he's coming for us.
-Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
02:00:00,422 --> 02:00:02,357
That was so scary.

1315
02:00:02,357 --> 02:00:05,292
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1316
02:00:16,738 --> 02:00:19,866
Sirius. Come on!

1317
02:00:35,891 --> 02:00:38,159
-This is horrible.
-Don't worry.

1318
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:41,390
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1319
02:00:50,105 --> 02:00:52,140
Any minute now.

1320
02:00:52,140 --> 02:00:54,165
Right there. You'll see.

1321
02:00:55,577 --> 02:00:58,246
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1322
02:00:58,246 --> 02:01:00,771
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1323
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:07,354
-Sirius.
-You're dying...

1324
02:01:09,424 --> 02:01:11,289
...both of you.

1325
02:01:13,361 --> 02:01:15,090
Harry!

1326
02:01:16,998 --> 02:01:20,866
Expecto Patronum!

1327
02:02:19,494 --> 02:02:21,229
You were right, Hermione.

1328
02:02:21,229 --> 02:02:24,733
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1329
02:02:24,733 --> 02:02:27,669
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
02:02:27,669 --> 02:02:30,205
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1331
02:02:30,205 --> 02:02:32,073
...well, I had already done it.

1332
02:02:32,073 --> 02:02:34,709
-Does that make sense?
-No.

1333
02:02:34,709 --> 02:02:37,542
But I don't like flying...!

1334
02:02:50,692 --> 02:02:52,023
Bombarda!

1335
02:03:25,326 --> 02:03:28,296
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1336
02:03:28,296 --> 02:03:29,798
...to both of you.

1337
02:03:29,798 --> 02:03:32,901
-I want to go with you.
-One day, perhaps.

1338
02:03:32,901 --> 02:03:35,970
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
02:03:35,970 --> 02:03:37,733
And besides...

1340
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:42,110
-...you're meant to be here.
-But you're innocent.

1341
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:44,237
And you know it.

1342
02:03:45,313 --> 02:03:47,213
And for now, that will do.

1343
02:03:49,517 --> 02:03:52,077
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1344
02:03:53,088 --> 02:03:55,613
...but you look so like your father.

1345
02:03:57,358 --> 02:03:59,326
Except your eyes.

1346
02:04:00,295 --> 02:04:02,593
-You have--
-My mother's eyes.

1347
02:04:04,532 --> 02:04:09,629
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1348
02:04:10,238 --> 02:04:11,728
But know this:

1349
02:04:12,841 --> 02:04:16,004
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
02:04:17,378 --> 02:04:19,346
And you can always find them...

1351
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:23,615
...in here.

1352
02:04:33,995 --> 02:04:36,520
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
02:05:03,358 --> 02:05:04,985
We have to go.

1354
02:05:33,254 --> 02:05:36,090
-Well?
-He's free. We did it.

1355
02:05:36,090 --> 02:05:37,826
Did what?

1356
02:05:37,826 --> 02:05:39,760
Good night.

1357
02:05:48,536 --> 02:05:50,038
How did you get there?

1358
02:05:50,038 --> 02:05:53,041
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:05:53,041 --> 02:05:55,844
-What's he talking about, Harry?
-I don't know.

1360
02:05:55,844 --> 02:05:59,371
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:06:25,874 --> 02:06:27,364
Hello, Harry.

1362
02:06:30,979 --> 02:06:32,810
I saw you coming.

1363
02:06:37,385 --> 02:06:40,081
I've looked worse, believe me.

1364
02:06:42,790 --> 02:06:46,127
-You've been sacked.
-No.

1365
02:06:46,127 --> 02:06:49,264
No. I resigned, actually.

1366
02:06:49,264 --> 02:06:51,199
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:06:51,199 --> 02:06:56,671
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:06:56,671 --> 02:07:02,343
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1369
02:07:02,343 --> 02:07:05,947
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:07:05,947 --> 02:07:08,016
-But Dumbledore--
-He has already...

1371
02:07:08,016 --> 02:07:10,051
...risked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:07:10,051 --> 02:07:13,316
Besides, people like me are....

1373
02:07:13,955 --> 02:07:17,288
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1374
02:07:26,834 --> 02:07:29,570
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1375
02:07:29,570 --> 02:07:31,940
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:07:31,940 --> 02:07:35,643
-Pettigrew escaped.
-Didn't make any difference?

1377
02:07:35,643 --> 02:07:39,314
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1378
02:07:39,314 --> 02:07:42,183
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:07:42,183 --> 02:07:44,674
It made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:07:49,324 --> 02:07:51,693
If I am proud of anything...

1381
02:07:51,693 --> 02:07:54,529
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:07:54,529 --> 02:07:57,465
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1383
02:07:57,465 --> 02:08:01,697
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:08:02,603 --> 02:08:05,273
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1385
02:08:05,273 --> 02:08:07,867
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:08:08,409 --> 02:08:09,740
Until then...

1387
02:08:11,079 --> 02:08:12,774
...mischief managed.

1388
02:08:47,048 --> 02:08:51,419
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:08:51,419 --> 02:08:52,818
Harry.

1390
02:08:53,654 --> 02:08:55,223
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:08:55,223 --> 02:08:57,792
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1392
02:08:57,792 --> 02:09:00,128
-What are you talking about?
-Quiet.

1393
02:09:00,128 --> 02:09:03,598
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:09:03,598 --> 02:09:06,267
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:09:06,267 --> 02:09:07,757
Did not.

1396
02:09:09,137 --> 02:09:12,807
-It's a Firebolt.
-It's the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:09:12,807 --> 02:09:14,542
For me?

1398
02:09:14,542 --> 02:09:17,245
-But who sent it?
-No one knows.

1399
02:09:17,245 --> 02:09:19,145
This came with it.

1400
02:09:23,985 --> 02:09:25,820
-Go on, Harry!
-Yeah, let's see.

1401
02:09:25,820 --> 02:09:27,651
How fast is it, Harry?

1402
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,810
Lumos.

1403
02:09:48,810 --> 02:09:51,210
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

1404
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:12,187
Mischief managed.

1405
02:21:17,965 --> 02:21:19,398
Nox.
