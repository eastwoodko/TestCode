1
00:01:22,437 --> 00:01:27,465
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,883
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:47,595
Are the rumors true, Albus?

4
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:53,067
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:56,504
-And the boy?
-Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:56,504 --> 00:02:00,440
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:05,879
Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:29,037
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:33,141
-No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
-No, sir.

10
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:37,578
LittIe tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:38,413 --> 00:02:40,904
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,708
There you go.

13
00:02:49,157 --> 00:02:53,962
Do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:59,400
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,638
-They really are--
-The only family he has.

16
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:08,810
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,745
Exactly.

18
00:03:10,745 --> 00:03:15,011
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:20,214
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,761
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

21
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:51,144
Good luck...

22
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:54,311
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:14,842
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:19,002
Now!

25
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:36,061
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:52,508
-Here he comes, the birthday boy.
-Happy birthday, son.

27
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:57,719
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:02,890
-Yes, Aunt Petunia.
-I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,060
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,020
-Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
-Yes, Uncle Vernon.

31
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,363
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

32
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:21,242
-How many are there?
-36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:21,242 --> 00:05:24,645
36?! But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:28,750
-But some are bigger than last year's.
-I don't care!

35
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,486
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:31,486 --> 00:05:35,820
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

37
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:43,388
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:48,936
I'm warning you now, boy.

39
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:52,673
Any funny business, any at all...

40
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:55,767
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:58,039
Get in.

42
00:06:05,253 --> 00:06:07,653
Make it move.

43
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:12,260
Move!

44
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,962
-Move!
-He's asleep!

45
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:17,487
He's boring.

46
00:06:19,934 --> 00:06:21,602
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:25,333
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there...

48
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:29,707
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:32,446 --> 00:06:35,142
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:42,123
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:43,758
Do you...?

52
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:47,854
Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:52,500
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,832
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:57,638 --> 00:07:02,610
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

56
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,570
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:30,671 --> 00:07:32,907
Thanks.

58
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:34,374
Anytime.

59
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:39,612
Snake!

60
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:58,633
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:01,761
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:07,400
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

63
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:17,515
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,456
-What happened?
-I swear, I don't know!

65
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:26,324
The glass was there
and then it was gone, like magic.

66
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:33,632
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:13,174
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

68
00:09:13,174 --> 00:09:16,644
-Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
-It's mine!

69
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:19,374
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

70
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:55,206
No more mail through this letterbox.

71
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:10,159
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

72
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,762
Shoo! Go on.

73
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:43,461
Fine day, Sunday.

74
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:49,003
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

75
00:10:49,003 --> 00:10:53,641
-Because there's no post on Sundays?
-Right you are, Harry!

76
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:56,371
No post on Sunday.

77
00:10:57,812 --> 00:11:01,714
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

78
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:07,277
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

79
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:19,565
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable--

80
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:33,308
Make it stop, please!

81
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:37,016
Stop it!

82
00:11:41,088 --> 00:11:44,080
Mummy, what's happening?

83
00:11:47,528 --> 00:11:51,862
Give me that! Give me that letter!

84
00:11:54,435 --> 00:11:56,232
Get off!

85
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:04,172
They're my letters! Let go of me!

86
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,971
That's it! We're going away!

87
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:12,553
Far away, where they can't find us!

88
00:12:12,553 --> 00:12:15,818
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

89
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:52,990
Make a wish, Harry.

90
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,134
Who's there?

91
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,758
Sorry about that.

92
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,230
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

93
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,941
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

94
00:13:48,148 --> 00:13:51,852
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

95
00:13:51,852 --> 00:13:56,590
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

96
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,423
I'm not Harry.

97
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:04,992
-I am.
-Well, of course you are.

98
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,601
Got something for you.

99
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:13,130
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

100
00:14:15,676 --> 00:14:19,077
Baked it myself, words and all.

101
00:14:24,618 --> 00:14:25,953
Thank you.

102
00:14:25,953 --> 00:14:30,014
It's not every day your young man
turns 11, is it?

103
00:14:45,239 --> 00:14:49,576
Excuse me, but who are you?

104
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:54,715
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

105
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:58,446
-Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
-Sorry, no.

106
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:04,191
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

107
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,793
Learned what?

108
00:15:05,793 --> 00:15:08,284
You're a wizard, Harry.

109
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,832
-I'm a what?
-A wizard.

110
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:15,069
A good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up.

111
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:18,172
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

112
00:15:18,172 --> 00:15:21,141
...I can't be a wizard.

113
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:26,576
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

114
00:15:27,648 --> 00:15:31,885
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

115
00:15:31,885 --> 00:15:36,481
Anything you couIdn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

116
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,276
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...

117
00:15:56,276 --> 00:15:59,713
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

118
00:15:59,713 --> 00:16:04,885
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

119
00:16:04,885 --> 00:16:09,323
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

120
00:16:09,323 --> 00:16:12,626
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

121
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:16,563
My perfect sister being who she was.

122
00:16:16,563 --> 00:16:22,703
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

123
00:16:22,703 --> 00:16:27,074
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

124
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:30,944
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

125
00:16:30,944 --> 00:16:32,880
A freak!

126
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,717
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

127
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:42,022
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

128
00:16:42,022 --> 00:16:47,261
And then she got herself blown up,
and we got landed with you.

129
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:51,465
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

130
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:56,003
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

131
00:16:56,003 --> 00:17:00,073
-We had to say something.
-It's an outrage! A scandal!

132
00:17:00,073 --> 00:17:02,810
He'll not be going.

133
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:06,313
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

134
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:07,648
Muggle?

135
00:17:07,648 --> 00:17:11,885
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

136
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:15,989
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

137
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:22,062
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.

138
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:27,100
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

139
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,872
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

140
00:17:31,872 --> 00:17:33,897
...in front of me.

141
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:57,264
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

142
00:17:57,264 --> 00:18:01,360
-I'm not allowed to do magic.
-Okay.

143
00:18:02,703 --> 00:18:05,638
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

144
00:18:11,845 --> 00:18:15,076
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

145
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:32,833
"All students must be equipped with...

146
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,003
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

147
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:42,009
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owI, a cat or a toad."

148
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:44,845
Can we find all this in London?

149
00:18:44,845 --> 00:18:47,211
If you know where to go.

150
00:19:10,003 --> 00:19:13,173
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

151
00:19:13,173 --> 00:19:17,277
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

152
00:19:17,277 --> 00:19:20,547
Just helping Harry
buy his school supplies.

153
00:19:20,547 --> 00:19:24,142
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

154
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:32,092
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

155
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:36,392
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

156
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:42,369
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

157
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:45,072
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.

158
00:19:45,072 --> 00:19:50,344
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

159
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:52,980
Oh, nice to meet you.

160
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,283
Fearfully fascinating subject.

161
00:19:56,283 --> 00:20:00,913
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

162
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:06,226
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

163
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,989
Goodbye.

164
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:14,501
-See, Harry? You're famous.
-But why am I famous?

165
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:18,138
All those people,
how is it they know who I am?

166
00:20:18,138 --> 00:20:21,972
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

167
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:42,725
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

168
00:20:59,046 --> 00:21:01,782
Here, you get your quills and ink.

169
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:05,741
Over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

170
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,046
It's a world-class racing broom.

171
00:21:33,046 --> 00:21:37,150
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

172
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,449
It's the fastest model yet.

173
00:21:44,091 --> 00:21:48,962
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

174
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:52,599
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

175
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:58,037
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

176
00:22:10,751 --> 00:22:14,921
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

177
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:20,427
They're goblins. Clever as they come,
but not the most friendly of beasts.

178
00:22:20,427 --> 00:22:22,327
Best stay close.

179
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:30,063
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

180
00:22:34,307 --> 00:22:37,470
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

181
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:41,642
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

182
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:47,521
Ha! There's the littIe devil.

183
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:50,354
And there's something eIse as well.

184
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:54,991
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

185
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:04,095
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

186
00:23:05,405 --> 00:23:07,373
Very well.

187
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:15,413
Vault 687.

188
00:23:17,317 --> 00:23:19,615
Lamp, please.

189
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:29,493
Key, please.

190
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,912
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

191
00:23:57,924 --> 00:24:01,895
-Vault 713.
-What's in there, Hagrid?

192
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:06,266
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

193
00:24:06,266 --> 00:24:07,824
Stand back.

194
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:38,927
Best not to mention this to anyone.

195
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:51,478
I still need a wand.

196
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:55,815
A wand? You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

197
00:24:55,815 --> 00:25:00,650
Run along there and wait. I got one more
thing to do. Won't be long.

198
00:25:18,672 --> 00:25:20,503
Hello?

199
00:25:23,476 --> 00:25:25,341
Hello?

200
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:33,148
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

201
00:25:40,927 --> 00:25:43,363
It seems only yesterday...

202
00:25:43,363 --> 00:25:49,233
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

203
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,173
Here we are.

204
00:26:06,786 --> 00:26:09,311
Give it a wave.

205
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:18,356
Apparently not.

206
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:28,002
Perhaps...

207
00:26:29,676 --> 00:26:31,837
...this.

208
00:26:38,818 --> 00:26:43,482
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

209
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,322
I wonder....

210
00:27:21,628 --> 00:27:24,130
Curious.

211
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,267
Very curious.

212
00:27:27,267 --> 00:27:30,395
Sorry, but what's curious?

213
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:35,608
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

214
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:38,545
It so happens that the phoenix...

215
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:43,683
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

216
00:27:43,683 --> 00:27:46,986
Just one other.

217
00:27:46,986 --> 00:27:51,524
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

218
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:57,258
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

219
00:27:59,065 --> 00:28:02,262
And who owned that wand?

220
00:28:03,136 --> 00:28:05,502
We do not speak his name.

221
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:09,709
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

222
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:13,079
It's not always clear why.

223
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:16,749
But I think it is clear...

224
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:20,887
...that we can expect
great things from you.

225
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:25,391
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

226
00:28:25,391 --> 00:28:28,228
...did great things.

227
00:28:28,228 --> 00:28:30,219
Terrible...

228
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,995
...yes, but great.

229
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:42,041
Harry! Harry!

230
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:44,407
Happy birthday.

231
00:28:51,551 --> 00:28:55,388
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

232
00:28:55,388 --> 00:29:01,227
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

233
00:29:01,227 --> 00:29:04,788
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

234
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:13,506
First, and understand this
because it's very important:

235
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:16,209
Not all wizards are good.

236
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:18,945
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

237
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:24,150
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--

238
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,021
-His name was V--
-Maybe if you wrote it down?

239
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:30,089
No, I can't spell it.

240
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:34,321
-All right, Voldemort.
-Voldemort?

241
00:29:38,264 --> 00:29:40,562
It was dark times, Harry.

242
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:46,172
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

243
00:29:46,172 --> 00:29:49,539
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

244
00:29:50,944 --> 00:29:54,072
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

245
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:58,451
Your parents fought against him.

246
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:02,182
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

247
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:09,362
Nobody, not one.

248
00:30:09,362 --> 00:30:11,762
Except you.

249
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,371
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

250
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:22,809
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

251
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:28,815
A mark Iike that only comes from being
touched by a curse, an evil curse.

252
00:30:28,815 --> 00:30:32,376
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

253
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:37,156
Well, some say he died.

254
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:39,726
Codswallop, in my opinion.

255
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:43,229
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

256
00:30:43,229 --> 00:30:46,399
...too tired to carry on.

257
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,038
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

258
00:30:52,038 --> 00:30:56,304
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

259
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:00,438
You're the boy who Iived.

260
00:31:09,756 --> 00:31:12,520
What are you looking at?

261
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:16,429
Blimey, is that the time?

262
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:20,700
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

263
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,738
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

264
00:31:25,738 --> 00:31:31,108
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket,
that's very important.

265
00:31:34,013 --> 00:31:36,482
"Platform 9 3/4"?

266
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:41,487
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

267
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:44,820
There's no such thing, is there?

268
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:04,867
Sorry.

269
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:09,349
Excuse me. Excuse me.

270
00:32:09,349 --> 00:32:11,117
On your left.

271
00:32:11,117 --> 00:32:15,154
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

272
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:17,924
Think you're being funny, do you?

273
00:32:17,924 --> 00:32:21,661
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles.

274
00:32:21,661 --> 00:32:25,062
-Muggles?
-Platform 9 3/4, this way.

275
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,933
All right, Percy, you first.

276
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:45,318
Fred, you next.

277
00:32:45,318 --> 00:32:49,188
-He's not Fred, I am.
-You call yourself our mother?

278
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:51,156
I'm sorry, George.

279
00:32:55,328 --> 00:32:57,762
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

280
00:33:03,536 --> 00:33:06,130
Excuse me.

281
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:10,243
Could you tell me how to...?

282
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:13,980
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

283
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,649
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

284
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:22,722
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

285
00:33:22,722 --> 00:33:26,180
-Best to run if you're nervous.
-Good luck.

286
00:34:23,783 --> 00:34:28,287
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

287
00:34:28,287 --> 00:34:30,517
Not at all.

288
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:36,229
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

289
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:38,891
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

290
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:42,502
So it's true!

291
00:34:42,502 --> 00:34:45,300
I mean, do you really have the...?

292
00:34:45,872 --> 00:34:48,773
-The what?
-The scar?

293
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:54,141
Wicked!

294
00:34:56,616 --> 00:35:01,781
-Anything off the trolley, dears?
-No, thanks. I'm all set.

295
00:35:05,825 --> 00:35:08,123
We'll take the lot.

296
00:35:18,804 --> 00:35:24,010
-Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
-They mean every flavor.

297
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:27,647
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

298
00:35:27,647 --> 00:35:31,717
...spinach, liver and tripe.

299
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:35,813
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

300
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:46,065
-Are they real frogs?
-It's a spell. You want the cards.

301
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:51,526
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

302
00:35:53,072 --> 00:35:55,302
Watch it!

303
00:35:57,343 --> 00:36:01,143
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

304
00:36:03,983 --> 00:36:07,885
-I've got Dumbledore!
-I got about six of him.

305
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,424
Hey, he's gone!

306
00:36:11,424 --> 00:36:14,882
You can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

307
00:36:15,528 --> 00:36:18,831
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?

308
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:20,232
A little.

309
00:36:20,232 --> 00:36:23,803
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

310
00:36:23,803 --> 00:36:25,794
Yeah.

311
00:36:32,578 --> 00:36:34,614
Has anyone seen a toad?

312
00:36:34,614 --> 00:36:37,208
-A boy named Neville's lost one.
-No.

313
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:42,184
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

314
00:36:43,222 --> 00:36:47,827
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

315
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:50,887
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow

316
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:59,438
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

317
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:02,942
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

318
00:37:02,942 --> 00:37:05,570
...but they've all worked for me.

319
00:37:09,215 --> 00:37:11,651
For example:

320
00:37:11,651 --> 00:37:14,415
Oculus Reparo.

321
00:37:16,522 --> 00:37:19,116
That's better, isn't it?

322
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:24,430
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

323
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,025
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

324
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:32,138
-I'm Ron Weasley.
-Pleasure.

325
00:37:32,138 --> 00:37:37,235
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

326
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,017
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

327
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:47,008
Just there.

328
00:37:59,331 --> 00:38:03,335
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

329
00:38:03,335 --> 00:38:08,568
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

330
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:18,540
-Hello, Harry.
-Hi, Hagrid.

331
00:38:19,618 --> 00:38:23,952
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.

332
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:11,232
Wicked.

333
00:39:39,365 --> 00:39:41,867
Welcome to Hogwarts.

334
00:39:41,867 --> 00:39:46,038
Now, In a few moments, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

335
00:39:46,038 --> 00:39:51,344
But before you take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

336
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:54,680
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

337
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,552
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

338
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:04,546
While you're here, your house
will be like your family.

339
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:08,928
Your triumphs will earn you points.

340
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:13,265
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

341
00:40:13,265 --> 00:40:18,838
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

342
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:20,100
Trevor!

343
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:30,850
Sorry.

344
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,786
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

345
00:40:36,122 --> 00:40:39,892
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

346
00:40:39,892 --> 00:40:42,762
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

347
00:40:42,762 --> 00:40:44,127
Harry Potter?

348
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:47,700
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

349
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,302
And I'm Malfoy.

350
00:40:50,302 --> 00:40:52,600
Draco Malfoy.

351
00:40:54,573 --> 00:40:58,411
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

352
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:04,145
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

353
00:41:05,117 --> 00:41:09,355
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

354
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:13,325
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

355
00:41:13,325 --> 00:41:15,520
I can help you there.

356
00:41:17,763 --> 00:41:21,563
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

357
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:29,434
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

358
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:52,832
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

359
00:41:52,832 --> 00:41:55,767
I read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.

360
00:42:09,014 --> 00:42:11,847
Will you wait along here, please?

361
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:16,222
Now, before we begin...

362
00:42:16,222 --> 00:42:19,759
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

363
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:24,897
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

364
00:42:24,897 --> 00:42:27,299
The first years, please note...

365
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:33,539
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

366
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:39,311
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

367
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:44,183
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

368
00:42:44,183 --> 00:42:48,449
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

369
00:42:49,822 --> 00:42:51,756
Thank you.

370
00:42:53,492 --> 00:42:57,830
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

371
00:42:57,830 --> 00:43:01,634
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

372
00:43:01,634 --> 00:43:05,070
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

373
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:07,698
Hermione Granger.

374
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:12,945
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

375
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:16,312
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

376
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:25,891
Right, then. Right.

377
00:43:25,891 --> 00:43:29,486
Okay. Gryffindor!

378
00:43:38,237 --> 00:43:41,070
Draco Malfoy.

379
00:43:45,578 --> 00:43:47,842
Slytherin!

380
00:43:48,747 --> 00:43:51,917
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

381
00:43:51,917 --> 00:43:54,442
Susan Bones.

382
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:05,331
Harry, what is it?

383
00:44:05,331 --> 00:44:08,300
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

384
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:10,002
Let's see....

385
00:44:10,002 --> 00:44:14,336
I know! Hufflepuff!

386
00:44:16,108 --> 00:44:18,542
Ronald Weasley.

387
00:44:32,324 --> 00:44:37,387
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

388
00:44:38,097 --> 00:44:40,395
Gryffindor!

389
00:44:46,605 --> 00:44:49,073
Harry Potter.

390
00:45:07,126 --> 00:45:10,329
Difficult, very difficult.

391
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:14,533
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

392
00:45:14,533 --> 00:45:17,036
There's talent, oh, yes.

393
00:45:17,036 --> 00:45:21,073
And a thirst to prove yourself.

394
00:45:21,073 --> 00:45:23,234
But where to put you?

395
00:45:23,842 --> 00:45:26,545
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

396
00:45:26,545 --> 00:45:30,416
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

397
00:45:30,416 --> 00:45:35,521
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

398
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:41,160
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness, no doubt about that.

399
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:46,031
No? Well, if you're sure.

400
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:48,000
Better be...

401
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,968
...Gryffindor!

402
00:46:15,494 --> 00:46:18,258
Your attention, please.

403
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:22,995
Let the feast begin.

404
00:46:39,952 --> 00:46:41,687
I'm half and half.

405
00:46:41,687 --> 00:46:45,124
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

406
00:46:45,124 --> 00:46:48,651
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

407
00:46:49,695 --> 00:46:53,799
Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

408
00:46:53,799 --> 00:46:57,136
Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

409
00:46:57,136 --> 00:46:59,271
-What's he teach?
-Potions.

410
00:46:59,271 --> 00:47:04,868
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

411
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:11,917
Hello! How are you?

412
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:15,318
Welcome to Gryffindor.

413
00:47:25,364 --> 00:47:27,855
It's the bloody Baron!

414
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:35,541
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

415
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:40,979
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

416
00:47:44,016 --> 00:47:47,152
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

417
00:47:47,152 --> 00:47:50,089
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

418
00:47:50,089 --> 00:47:53,892
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

419
00:47:53,892 --> 00:47:55,860
Like this.

420
00:48:05,904 --> 00:48:09,975
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.

421
00:48:09,975 --> 00:48:14,513
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

422
00:48:14,513 --> 00:48:18,050
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

423
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,282
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

424
00:48:31,396 --> 00:48:37,402
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

425
00:48:37,402 --> 00:48:40,272
That picture's moving.

426
00:48:40,272 --> 00:48:43,730
-Look at that one.
-I think she fancies you.

427
00:48:45,544 --> 00:48:48,080
-Look!
-Who's that girl?

428
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,571
Welcome to Hogwarts.

429
00:49:06,598 --> 00:49:08,634
Password?

430
00:49:08,634 --> 00:49:11,501
Caput Draconis.

431
00:49:18,243 --> 00:49:23,112
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

432
00:49:25,817 --> 00:49:28,251
Gather around here.

433
00:49:29,922 --> 00:49:33,458
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

434
00:49:33,458 --> 00:49:38,063
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.

435
00:49:38,063 --> 00:49:41,157
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

436
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,381
Made it!

437
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:56,011
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

438
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:04,227
-That was bloody brilliant!
-Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley.

439
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:08,698
Perhaps it would be more useful if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a a pocket watch?

440
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:12,135
-Then one of you might be on time.
-We got lost.

441
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:17,937
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

442
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:31,988
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

443
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:35,826
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

444
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:39,763
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

445
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,857
However, for those select few...

446
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,134
...who possess the predisposition...

447
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,311
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

448
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,414
...and ensnare the senses.

449
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:00,150
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

450
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:06,055
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

451
00:52:10,393 --> 00:52:16,633
Then again, maybe some of you have come
to Hogwarts in possession of abilities...

452
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:20,337
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

453
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:23,773
...to not pay attention.

454
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,908
Mr. Potter.

455
00:52:34,117 --> 00:52:37,951
Our new celebrity.

456
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:45,925
Tell me what would I get if I powdered root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

457
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:51,801
You don't know? Let's try again.

458
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:56,397
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

459
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,342
I don't know, sir.

460
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:03,244
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

461
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,013
I don't know, sir.

462
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,746
Pity.

463
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:16,286
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

464
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,858
...is it, Mr. Potter?

465
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:27,628
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

466
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,740
Eye of rabbit....

467
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,643
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

468
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:38,410
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before--

469
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,022
Mail's here.

470
00:54:19,322 --> 00:54:22,257
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

471
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:28,632
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.

472
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:34,437
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

473
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:38,108
The problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

474
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:41,711
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

475
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:45,615
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

476
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:51,588
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

477
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:57,527
The vault in question, number 713,
had been emptied earlier that same day."

478
00:54:57,527 --> 00:55:01,759
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

479
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:14,644
-Good afternoon, class.
-Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

480
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,442
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

481
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,418
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

482
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:25,555
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

483
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:31,361
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

484
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,496
Up!

485
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:34,485
Up.

486
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,796
Up.

487
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,337
Up. Up!

488
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:43,328
With feeling.

489
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,350
Shut up, Harry.

490
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:59,255
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

491
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:03,626
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

492
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:08,798
When I blow my whistle, I want you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

493
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,836
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

494
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:17,340
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

495
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,468
On my whistle. Three, two....

496
00:56:22,946 --> 00:56:24,311
Mr. Longbottom.

497
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:32,021
-Mr. Longbottom!
-Down, down!

498
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,249
Neville!

499
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,655
Come back down this instant!

500
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:11,025
Everyone out of the way!

501
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:19,068
Is he all right?

502
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:24,802
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

503
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:30,947
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

504
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,818
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

505
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:40,290
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Quidditch.

506
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,425
Did you see his face?

507
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:46,496
If he had squeezed this, he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

508
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:48,987
Give it here, Malfoy.

509
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:53,530
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

510
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:00,142
How about on the roof?

511
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:05,178
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

512
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:11,721
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

513
00:58:11,721 --> 00:58:14,924
Besides, you don't know how to fly.

514
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,858
What an idiot.

515
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:23,900
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

516
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,993
Is that so?

517
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,470
Have it your way, then.

518
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:08,044
-Nice going, Harry.
-That was wicked, Harry!

519
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,103
Harry Potter!

520
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,072
Follow me.

521
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,991
You wait here.

522
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:34,270
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

523
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,101
Yes, of course.

524
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:47,479
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

525
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:53,323
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

526
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:56,025
I always knew he'd do well.

527
00:59:56,025 --> 01:00:00,263
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

528
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:05,001
-You must be the youngest player in--
-A century, McGonagall says.

529
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:07,804
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

530
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:10,540
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

531
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:14,444
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

532
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,313
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.

533
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:21,484
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

534
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:24,454
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

535
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:30,360
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

536
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:33,930
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

537
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:38,765
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

538
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:51,143
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

539
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,142
I didn't know.

540
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:03,459
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

541
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:05,791
Who doesn't?

542
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:09,065
What's happening?

543
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:13,263
The staircases change, remember?

544
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:23,168
-Let's go this way.
-Before the staircase moves again.

545
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,457
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

546
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:36,793
We're not supposed to be here.

547
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:40,729
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

548
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:43,489
Let's go.

549
01:01:45,701 --> 01:01:48,602
-It's Filch's cat!
-Run!

550
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:55,811
Quick, let's hide through that door!

551
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:03,086
-It's locked!
-We're done for!

552
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:05,281
Move over!

553
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,349
Alohomora.

554
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:11,158
Get in.

555
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:13,696
Alohomora?

556
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:16,432
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

557
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:19,833
Anyone here, my sweet?

558
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,064
Come on.

559
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:30,646
-Filch is gone.
-He thinks this door's locked.

560
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:34,275
-It was locked.
-And for good reason.

561
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:05,681
What are they doing, keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

562
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:09,519
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

563
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,923
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

564
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,993
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

565
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:20,863
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

566
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:24,800
-It's guarding something.
-Guarding something?

567
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,838
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

568
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:32,642
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

569
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:35,770
Or worse, expelled.

570
01:03:39,048 --> 01:03:43,280
She needs to sort out her priorities.

571
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:52,295
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

572
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:58,063
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

573
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:07,476
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

574
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:13,649
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

575
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:18,221
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

576
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:22,715
I think so. What are those?

577
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,155
You better take this.

578
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:39,970
Careful now, it's coming back.

579
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:50,211
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

580
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:09,167
What was that?

581
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:13,876
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

582
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:17,368
But you are a Seeker.

583
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:25,755
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

584
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,524
The Golden Snitch.

585
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:31,727
-I like this ball.
-You like it now.

586
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:35,965
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

587
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:38,100
What do I do with it?

588
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,570
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

589
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,273
You catch this, the game's over.

590
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:48,232
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

591
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:02,858
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

592
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:07,029
...or the ability to make objects fly.

593
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,632
Do you have your feathers? Good.

594
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:14,970
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

595
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:18,908
The swish and flick. Everyone.

596
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:24,505
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

597
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:29,480
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

598
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:33,322
Wingardium Leviosa.

599
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,620
Wingardium Leviosa.

600
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:43,966
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

601
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:49,962
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

602
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:54,772
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

603
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:59,105
Wingardium Leviosa.

604
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:12,428
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

605
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:14,123
Splendid!

606
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,859
Well done, dear.

607
01:07:22,138 --> 01:07:26,199
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

608
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:37,186
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. "

609
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:42,522
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

610
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,727
I think she heard you.

611
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,725
Where's Hermione?

612
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:20,062
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

613
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:24,123
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

614
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:32,441
Troll in the dungeon!

615
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,774
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,912
Thought you ought to know.

617
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:50,655
Silence!

618
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:56,289
Everyone will please not panic!

619
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:58,767
Now...

620
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:03,329
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

621
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:08,842
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

622
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:23,259
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

623
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,227
How could a troll get in?

624
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:30,599
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

625
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:34,592
-What?
-Hermione! She doesn't know.

626
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:49,914
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

627
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,950
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

628
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:29,354
Hermione, move!

629
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:36,926
Help! Help!

630
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,994
Hey, pea brain!

631
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,282
Help!

632
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,770
Do something!

633
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:24,201
-What?
-Anything!

634
01:11:24,813 --> 01:11:27,483
-Hurry up!
-Swish and flick.

635
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,747
Wingardium Leviosa.

636
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,720
Cool.

637
01:12:07,122 --> 01:12:10,159
Is it dead?

638
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:14,095
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

639
01:12:20,369 --> 01:12:22,701
Troll boogers.

640
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,944
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

641
01:12:28,944 --> 01:12:33,540
-Well, what it is--
-It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

642
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:36,945
Miss Granger?

643
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:43,125
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

644
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:45,227
But I was wrong.

645
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:50,221
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

646
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,904
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

647
01:12:55,904 --> 01:13:01,744
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

648
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,980
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

649
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:09,017
...for your serious lack of judgment.

650
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:11,220
As for you two gentlemen...

651
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,857
...I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

652
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:18,494
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

653
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,330
...and live to tell the tale.

654
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,798
Five points...

655
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:28,295
...will be awarded to each of you...

656
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:32,898
...for sheer dumb luck.

657
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:42,244
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

658
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:53,061
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

659
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:56,498
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

660
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:58,693
I'm not hungry.

661
01:13:59,267 --> 01:14:05,073
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

662
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:08,510
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

663
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:11,570
Even if it is against Slytherin.

664
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:23,158
-That explains the blood.
-Blood?

665
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:27,496
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

666
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:30,298
...so he could get past that dog.

667
01:14:30,298 --> 01:14:33,301
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

668
01:14:33,301 --> 01:14:36,238
But why would anyone go near that dog?

669
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:39,674
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

670
01:14:39,674 --> 01:14:43,144
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

671
01:14:43,144 --> 01:14:44,513
You're saying--

672
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:48,950
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

673
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:06,089
-Bit early for mail, isn't it?
-But I never get mail.

674
01:15:06,601 --> 01:15:08,159
Let's open it.

675
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:19,610
It's a broomstick.

676
01:15:20,382 --> 01:15:24,546
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

677
01:15:25,987 --> 01:15:28,046
But who--?

678
01:15:49,544 --> 01:15:52,314
-Scared, Harry?
-A little.

679
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:56,184
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

680
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:59,988
-What happened?
-I don't really remember.

681
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:02,824
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

682
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:05,691
Woke up in hospital a week later.

683
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:31,453
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

684
01:16:31,453 --> 01:16:36,117
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

685
01:17:06,454 --> 01:17:09,090
The players take their positions...

686
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:13,094
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

687
01:17:13,094 --> 01:17:16,461
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

688
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:19,500
...from all of you!

689
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:27,742
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

690
01:17:27,742 --> 01:17:30,679
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

691
01:17:30,679 --> 01:17:34,479
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

692
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:45,116
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

693
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:08,178
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

694
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:14,685
Well done!

695
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:24,726
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

696
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:59,631
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

697
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,280
Give me that!

698
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:49,342
Take that side!

699
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:42,064
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

700
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:53,448
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

701
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:57,817
-Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
-Leave it to me.

702
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:21,064
Come on, Hermione!

703
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:38,954
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

704
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:49,060
Fire! You're on fire!

705
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:09,082
Go, go, go, go!

706
01:23:01,109 --> 01:23:03,475
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

707
01:23:04,545 --> 01:23:06,247
He's got the Snitch!

708
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:10,485
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

709
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:12,180
Gryffindor wins!

710
01:23:55,797 --> 01:24:00,234
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

711
01:24:00,234 --> 01:24:04,372
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

712
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,975
-Who told you about Fluffy?
-Fluffy?

713
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:10,878
-That thing has a name?
-Of course he has a name. He's mine.

714
01:24:10,878 --> 01:24:16,384
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

715
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:20,946
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

716
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:25,760
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

717
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,218
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

718
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:35,036
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

719
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:38,840
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

720
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:41,035
Exactly.

721
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:44,712
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

722
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:49,550
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

723
01:24:49,550 --> 01:24:54,856
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

724
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:56,289
NichoIas Flamel?

725
01:24:57,291 --> 01:25:02,163
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

726
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:06,534
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

727
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:08,502
I don't know.

728
01:25:27,355 --> 01:25:30,391
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

729
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:33,428
Ring the Hogwart bell

730
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:36,397
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

731
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:39,366
Cast a Christmas spell

732
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:56,313
Knight to E-5.

733
01:26:03,991 --> 01:26:06,152
Queen to E-5.

734
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:13,801
That's totally barbaric!

735
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:17,572
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

736
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:19,373
I see you haven't.

737
01:26:19,373 --> 01:26:24,745
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

738
01:26:24,745 --> 01:26:28,749
-He's studying dragons there.
-Good. You can help Harry.

739
01:26:28,749 --> 01:26:32,386
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

740
01:26:32,386 --> 01:26:35,844
We've looked a hundred times!

741
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:41,757
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

742
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:46,899
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

743
01:26:49,403 --> 01:26:53,772
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

744
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:07,155
-Happy Christmas, Harry.
-Happy Christmas, Ron.

745
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:09,350
What are you wearing?

746
01:27:09,991 --> 01:27:13,654
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

747
01:27:14,795 --> 01:27:17,229
-I've got presents?
-Yeah.

748
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,732
There they are.

749
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:41,455
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

750
01:27:41,455 --> 01:27:45,585
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

751
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:06,447
-What is it?
-Some kind of cloak.

752
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:09,382
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

753
01:28:14,755 --> 01:28:16,257
My body's gone!

754
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:19,852
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

755
01:28:20,394 --> 01:28:22,294
I'm invisible?

756
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:27,635
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

757
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:32,470
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

758
01:29:00,534 --> 01:29:06,607
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

759
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:12,409
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

760
01:29:31,299 --> 01:29:33,164
Who's there?

761
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:44,939
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

762
01:29:52,353 --> 01:29:56,050
Who is it? Show yourself.

763
01:30:43,237 --> 01:30:44,636
Severus, I....

764
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:49,377
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

765
01:30:49,377 --> 01:30:54,110
-I don't know what you mean.
-You know perfectly well what I mean.

766
01:31:11,332 --> 01:31:14,769
We'll have another little chat soon.

767
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:20,441
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

768
01:31:20,441 --> 01:31:24,901
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

769
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:30,474
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

770
01:33:02,543 --> 01:33:04,408
Mum?

771
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:09,673
Dad?

772
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:49,345
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

773
01:33:51,191 --> 01:33:54,295
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

774
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,822
-Why?
-There's something you've got to see!

775
01:34:04,605 --> 01:34:08,871
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

776
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:12,513
I only see us.

777
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:16,083
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

778
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:21,988
-There. You see them, don't you?
-That's me! Only I'm head boy.

779
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:25,059
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

780
01:34:25,059 --> 01:34:29,257
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

781
01:34:30,431 --> 01:34:32,865
I look good.

782
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:37,538
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

783
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:42,498
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

784
01:35:05,599 --> 01:35:07,760
Back again, Harry?

785
01:35:10,904 --> 01:35:13,574
I see that you,
like many before you...

786
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:18,078
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

787
01:35:18,078 --> 01:35:22,242
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

788
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:26,109
Let me give you a clue.

789
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:28,989
The happiest man on earth...

790
01:35:28,989 --> 01:35:32,593
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

791
01:35:32,593 --> 01:35:35,129
...exactly as he is.

792
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:40,401
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

793
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:43,097
Yes. And no.

794
01:35:44,138 --> 01:35:46,840
It shows us nothing more or less...

795
01:35:46,840 --> 01:35:53,013
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

796
01:35:53,013 --> 01:35:57,918
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

797
01:35:57,918 --> 01:36:02,022
...you see them standing beside you.

798
01:36:02,022 --> 01:36:04,692
But remember this, Harry.

799
01:36:04,692 --> 01:36:10,764
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

800
01:36:10,764 --> 01:36:12,823
...or truth.

801
01:36:13,867 --> 01:36:19,828
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

802
01:36:20,908 --> 01:36:25,279
That is why tomorrow,
it will be moved to a new home.

803
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:27,213
And I must ask you...

804
01:36:28,115 --> 01:36:32,051
...not to go looking for it again.

805
01:36:32,786 --> 01:36:35,914
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

806
01:36:36,457 --> 01:36:39,358
...and forget to live.

807
01:37:34,018 --> 01:37:39,924
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

808
01:37:39,924 --> 01:37:43,227
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

809
01:37:43,227 --> 01:37:45,218
This is light?

810
01:37:49,934 --> 01:37:51,993
Of course! Here it is!

811
01:37:52,570 --> 01:37:56,674
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Sorcerer's Stone.

812
01:37:56,674 --> 01:37:57,868
The what?

813
01:37:58,542 --> 01:38:01,746
Honestly, don't you two read?

814
01:38:01,746 --> 01:38:06,484
"The Sorcerer's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

815
01:38:06,484 --> 01:38:09,286
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

816
01:38:09,286 --> 01:38:13,491
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

817
01:38:13,491 --> 01:38:15,893
-Immortal?
-It means you'll never die.

818
01:38:15,893 --> 01:38:17,986
I know what it means!

819
01:38:18,829 --> 01:38:23,801
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

820
01:38:23,801 --> 01:38:28,898
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

821
01:38:30,674 --> 01:38:33,010
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

822
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:37,743
That's what's under the trap door.
The Sorcerer's Stone.

823
01:38:54,532 --> 01:38:58,536
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

824
01:38:58,536 --> 01:39:01,266
We know about the Sorcerer's Stone.

825
01:39:05,976 --> 01:39:11,282
-We think Snape's trying to steal it.
-Are you still on about him?

826
01:39:11,282 --> 01:39:14,485
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

827
01:39:14,485 --> 01:39:19,089
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

828
01:39:19,089 --> 01:39:20,224
What?

829
01:39:20,224 --> 01:39:23,928
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

830
01:39:23,928 --> 01:39:26,664
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

831
01:39:26,664 --> 01:39:30,734
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

832
01:39:30,734 --> 01:39:33,571
-Spells, enchantments.
-Right.

833
01:39:33,571 --> 01:39:36,841
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

834
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:39,176
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

835
01:39:39,176 --> 01:39:43,047
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

836
01:39:43,047 --> 01:39:46,642
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

837
01:40:00,497 --> 01:40:05,803
-Hagrid, what exactIy is that?
-That? It's....

838
01:40:05,803 --> 01:40:08,038
I know what that is!

839
01:40:08,038 --> 01:40:11,008
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

840
01:40:11,008 --> 01:40:14,478
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

841
01:40:14,478 --> 01:40:18,608
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

842
01:40:40,838 --> 01:40:43,068
Is that...

843
01:40:43,841 --> 01:40:45,242
...a dragon?

844
01:40:45,242 --> 01:40:49,847
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

845
01:40:49,847 --> 01:40:52,883
My brother works
with these in Romania.

846
01:40:52,883 --> 01:40:57,820
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

847
01:40:58,455 --> 01:41:00,591
Hello, Norbert.

848
01:41:00,591 --> 01:41:04,857
-Norbert?
-He's gotta have a name, don't he?

849
01:41:05,562 --> 01:41:08,053
Don't you, Norbert?

850
01:41:15,005 --> 01:41:18,168
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

851
01:41:22,012 --> 01:41:24,071
Who's that?

852
01:41:25,849 --> 01:41:27,942
Malfoy.

853
01:41:28,686 --> 01:41:30,085
Oh, dear.

854
01:41:31,755 --> 01:41:36,794
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

855
01:41:36,794 --> 01:41:41,031
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

856
01:41:41,031 --> 01:41:45,469
-I don't understand. Is that bad?
-It's bad.

857
01:41:45,469 --> 01:41:47,596
Good evening.

858
01:41:51,241 --> 01:41:54,378
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

859
01:41:54,378 --> 01:41:58,148
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

860
01:41:58,148 --> 01:42:03,187
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

861
01:42:03,187 --> 01:42:05,553
-50?!
-Each.

862
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:09,159
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

863
01:42:09,159 --> 01:42:12,458
...all four of you
will receive detention.

864
01:42:13,430 --> 01:42:16,567
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

865
01:42:16,567 --> 01:42:19,169
I thought you said the four of us.

866
01:42:19,169 --> 01:42:21,805
No, you heard me correctly.

867
01:42:21,805 --> 01:42:26,833
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

868
01:42:27,344 --> 01:42:30,279
You will join your classmates
in detention.

869
01:42:41,492 --> 01:42:45,696
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

870
01:42:45,696 --> 01:42:50,634
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

871
01:42:50,634 --> 01:42:53,467
God, I miss the screaming.

872
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:59,510
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

873
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:04,880
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

874
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:09,885
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

875
01:43:11,355 --> 01:43:16,349
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

876
01:43:18,629 --> 01:43:21,198
Norbert's gone.

877
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:25,035
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

878
01:43:25,035 --> 01:43:28,472
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

879
01:43:28,472 --> 01:43:31,041
What if he don't like Romania?

880
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:35,307
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

881
01:43:35,913 --> 01:43:41,418
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

882
01:43:41,418 --> 01:43:43,987
Got to have your wits about you.

883
01:43:43,987 --> 01:43:50,060
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

884
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:53,962
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

885
01:43:55,499 --> 01:43:57,167
...werewolves.

886
01:43:57,167 --> 01:44:00,637
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

887
01:44:00,637 --> 01:44:03,333
You can be sure of that.

888
01:44:05,309 --> 01:44:06,674
Nighty-night.

889
01:44:09,246 --> 01:44:12,511
Right. Let's go.

890
01:44:50,354 --> 01:44:52,956
Hagrid, what is that?

891
01:44:52,956 --> 01:44:56,793
What we're here for.
See that?

892
01:44:56,793 --> 01:45:02,231
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

893
01:45:02,766 --> 01:45:07,328
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

894
01:45:14,878 --> 01:45:20,817
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

895
01:45:20,817 --> 01:45:23,911
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

896
01:45:24,421 --> 01:45:27,720
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

897
01:45:29,193 --> 01:45:31,428
Okay. Then I get Fang.

898
01:45:31,428 --> 01:45:37,162
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

899
01:45:40,871 --> 01:45:46,009
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

900
01:45:46,009 --> 01:45:50,180
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

901
01:45:50,180 --> 01:45:53,081
I'm not scared, Potter.

902
01:45:53,917 --> 01:45:55,885
Do you hear that?

903
01:45:58,355 --> 01:46:00,023
Come on, Fang.

904
01:46:00,023 --> 01:46:01,456
Scared!

905
01:46:26,550 --> 01:46:28,745
What is it, Fang?

906
01:47:39,122 --> 01:47:44,828
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

907
01:47:44,828 --> 01:47:49,066
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

908
01:47:49,066 --> 01:47:51,968
What was that thing you saved me from?

909
01:47:51,968 --> 01:47:57,541
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

910
01:47:57,541 --> 01:48:03,313
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

911
01:48:03,313 --> 01:48:08,585
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

912
01:48:08,585 --> 01:48:13,657
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

913
01:48:13,657 --> 01:48:15,692
A cursed life.

914
01:48:15,692 --> 01:48:19,830
-Who would choose such a life?
-Can you think of no one?

915
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:25,135
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

916
01:48:25,135 --> 01:48:29,272
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

917
01:48:29,272 --> 01:48:34,437
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

918
01:48:35,278 --> 01:48:36,768
The Sorcerer's Stone.

919
01:48:38,115 --> 01:48:40,106
Harry!

920
01:48:40,684 --> 01:48:45,389
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

921
01:48:45,389 --> 01:48:47,516
You all right there, Harry?

922
01:48:48,725 --> 01:48:52,991
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

923
01:48:53,897 --> 01:48:57,731
You're safe now. Good luck.

924
01:49:05,208 --> 01:49:09,646
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

925
01:49:09,646 --> 01:49:12,682
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

926
01:49:12,682 --> 01:49:15,819
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

927
01:49:15,819 --> 01:49:20,390
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

928
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:25,162
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

929
01:49:25,162 --> 01:49:26,897
He'll come back.

930
01:49:26,897 --> 01:49:28,899
But if he comes back...

931
01:49:28,899 --> 01:49:32,892
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

932
01:49:33,904 --> 01:49:37,674
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

933
01:49:37,674 --> 01:49:41,445
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

934
01:49:41,445 --> 01:49:45,415
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

935
01:49:45,415 --> 01:49:50,250
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

936
01:49:51,054 --> 01:49:56,393
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

937
01:49:56,393 --> 01:50:00,420
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

938
01:50:06,203 --> 01:50:11,808
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

939
01:50:11,808 --> 01:50:15,712
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

940
01:50:15,712 --> 01:50:21,084
-My scar. It keeps burning.
-It's happened before.

941
01:50:21,084 --> 01:50:23,987
-Not like this.
-You should see the nurse.

942
01:50:23,987 --> 01:50:27,423
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

943
01:50:35,098 --> 01:50:37,767
-Of course!
-What is it?

944
01:50:37,767 --> 01:50:41,738
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

945
01:50:41,738 --> 01:50:44,975
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

946
01:50:44,975 --> 01:50:47,911
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

947
01:50:47,911 --> 01:50:50,175
Why didn't I see it before?

948
01:50:55,752 --> 01:50:59,456
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

949
01:50:59,456 --> 01:51:02,425
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

950
01:51:02,425 --> 01:51:04,950
You and this stranger
must have talked.

951
01:51:05,595 --> 01:51:09,366
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

952
01:51:09,366 --> 01:51:13,537
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

953
01:51:13,537 --> 01:51:18,441
-Was he interested in Fluffy?
-Of course he was interested.

954
01:51:18,441 --> 01:51:22,779
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

955
01:51:22,779 --> 01:51:28,652
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

956
01:51:28,652 --> 01:51:34,090
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

957
01:51:35,759 --> 01:51:38,662
I shouldn't have told you that.

958
01:51:38,662 --> 01:51:40,892
Where are you going?

959
01:51:47,871 --> 01:51:51,041
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

960
01:51:51,041 --> 01:51:53,910
I'm afraid he's not here.

961
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:58,648
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

962
01:51:58,648 --> 01:52:01,818
He's gone?
But this is important!

963
01:52:01,818 --> 01:52:05,522
This is about the Sorcerer's Stone!

964
01:52:05,522 --> 01:52:09,288
-How do you know--?
-Someone's going to try and steal it.

965
01:52:09,893 --> 01:52:15,332
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

966
01:52:15,332 --> 01:52:19,632
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

967
01:52:27,911 --> 01:52:30,914
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

968
01:52:30,914 --> 01:52:33,750
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

969
01:52:33,750 --> 01:52:37,652
-And with Dumbledore gone--
-Good afternoon.

970
01:52:39,689 --> 01:52:43,193
What would three young Gryffindors...

971
01:52:43,193 --> 01:52:47,960
...be doing inside on a day like this?

972
01:52:52,135 --> 01:52:55,627
-We were just--
-You ought to be careful.

973
01:52:56,206 --> 01:52:58,197
People will think you're...

974
01:53:02,479 --> 01:53:05,141
...up to something.

975
01:53:15,492 --> 01:53:17,661
Now what do we do?

976
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:21,461
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

977
01:53:35,078 --> 01:53:36,880
Trevor.

978
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:40,550
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

979
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:46,189
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

980
01:53:46,189 --> 01:53:50,427
-Neville, listen. We were--
-No, I won't let you!

981
01:53:50,427 --> 01:53:55,198
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

982
01:53:55,198 --> 01:54:00,727
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

983
01:54:07,444 --> 01:54:11,481
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

984
01:54:11,481 --> 01:54:15,144
Brilliant, but scary.

985
01:54:15,752 --> 01:54:18,054
Let's go.

986
01:54:18,054 --> 01:54:22,320
-Sorry.
-It's for your own good, you know.

987
01:54:27,731 --> 01:54:31,690
-You stood on my foot!
-Sorry.

988
01:54:35,538 --> 01:54:37,563
Alohomora.

989
01:54:49,619 --> 01:54:52,144
Wait a minute. He's...

990
01:54:53,423 --> 01:54:55,186
...snoring.

991
01:54:58,094 --> 01:55:03,589
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

992
01:55:05,235 --> 01:55:08,227
It's got horrible breath.

993
01:55:10,774 --> 01:55:13,076
-We have to move its paw.
-What?

994
01:55:13,076 --> 01:55:14,543
Come on!

995
01:55:18,581 --> 01:55:20,640
Okay. Push.

996
01:55:43,807 --> 01:55:47,610
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

997
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:52,638
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

998
01:55:53,450 --> 01:55:56,886
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

999
01:55:57,620 --> 01:55:59,451
The harp.

1000
01:56:00,123 --> 01:56:02,819
It's stopped playing.

1001
01:56:13,136 --> 01:56:14,865
Jump!

1002
01:56:28,184 --> 01:56:31,813
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

1003
01:56:46,236 --> 01:56:49,539
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1004
01:56:49,539 --> 01:56:53,443
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

1005
01:56:53,443 --> 01:56:58,403
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

1006
01:57:00,717 --> 01:57:02,048
Hermione!

1007
01:57:02,585 --> 01:57:06,623
-Now what are we gonna do?
-Just relax!

1008
01:57:06,623 --> 01:57:11,083
-Hermione, where are you?
-Do what I say! Trust me.

1009
01:57:18,234 --> 01:57:21,771
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1010
01:57:21,771 --> 01:57:25,041
-He's not relaxing, is he?
-Apparently not.

1011
01:57:25,041 --> 01:57:27,744
-We've gotta do something.
-What?

1012
01:57:27,744 --> 01:57:30,713
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1013
01:57:31,548 --> 01:57:35,618
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

1014
01:57:35,618 --> 01:57:40,256
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1015
01:57:40,256 --> 01:57:42,315
Lumus Solem.

1016
01:57:50,366 --> 01:57:52,960
-Ron, you okay?
-Yeah.

1017
01:57:55,638 --> 01:57:58,129
Lucky we didn't panic.

1018
01:57:58,908 --> 01:58:02,400
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1019
01:58:04,013 --> 01:58:05,748
What is that?

1020
01:58:05,748 --> 01:58:09,548
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1021
01:58:22,599 --> 01:58:26,269
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1022
01:58:26,269 --> 01:58:30,106
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1023
01:58:30,106 --> 01:58:33,564
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1024
01:58:37,046 --> 01:58:41,642
-What's this all about?
-I don't know.

1025
01:58:47,523 --> 01:58:49,959
Strange.

1026
01:58:49,959 --> 01:58:52,291
Alohomora!

1027
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:57,734
Well, it was worth a try.

1028
01:58:57,734 --> 01:59:01,170
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1029
01:59:01,170 --> 01:59:05,308
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1030
01:59:05,308 --> 01:59:08,675
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1031
01:59:12,315 --> 01:59:14,647
What's wrong?

1032
01:59:15,518 --> 01:59:17,186
It's too simple.

1033
01:59:17,186 --> 01:59:22,191
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

1034
01:59:22,191 --> 01:59:25,752
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1035
01:59:42,578 --> 01:59:45,604
This complicates things a bit.

1036
02:00:06,869 --> 02:00:09,064
Catch the key!

1037
02:00:13,176 --> 02:00:15,110
Hurry up!

1038
02:00:47,577 --> 02:00:52,515
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1039
02:00:52,515 --> 02:00:56,019
Where are we? A graveyard.

1040
02:00:56,019 --> 02:00:58,647
This is no graveyard.

1041
02:01:06,162 --> 02:01:09,097
It's a chessboard.

1042
02:01:21,044 --> 02:01:22,978
There's the door.

1043
02:01:35,058 --> 02:01:36,859
Now what do we do?

1044
02:01:36,859 --> 02:01:41,057
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1045
02:01:41,631 --> 02:01:45,735
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

1046
02:01:45,735 --> 02:01:50,139
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1047
02:01:50,139 --> 02:01:54,235
As for me, I'll be a knight.

1048
02:02:01,384 --> 02:02:03,113
What happens now?

1049
02:02:03,853 --> 02:02:07,090
Well, white moves first.

1050
02:02:07,090 --> 02:02:08,955
And then...

1051
02:02:10,726 --> 02:02:11,988
...we play.

1052
02:02:22,538 --> 02:02:27,844
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1053
02:02:27,844 --> 02:02:31,814
...real wizard's chess, do you?

1054
02:02:31,814 --> 02:02:34,749
You there, D-5.

1055
02:02:49,365 --> 02:02:51,134
Yes, Hermione.

1056
02:02:51,134 --> 02:02:56,197
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1057
02:03:02,111 --> 02:03:04,671
Castle to E-4!

1058
02:03:08,284 --> 02:03:10,309
Pawn to C-3!

1059
02:03:55,231 --> 02:03:59,435
-Wait a minute.
-You understand right, Harry.

1060
02:03:59,435 --> 02:04:04,202
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

1061
02:04:04,774 --> 02:04:07,376
Then you're free to check the king.

1062
02:04:07,376 --> 02:04:10,004
-No. Ron, no!
-What is it?

1063
02:04:10,713 --> 02:04:15,585
-He's going to sacrifice himself.
-No, there must be another way!

1064
02:04:15,585 --> 02:04:19,488
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1065
02:04:19,488 --> 02:04:23,593
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1066
02:04:23,593 --> 02:04:26,391
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1067
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:39,574
Knight to H-3.

1068
02:05:00,463 --> 02:05:02,454
Check.

1069
02:05:31,627 --> 02:05:33,629
Ron!

1070
02:05:33,629 --> 02:05:39,465
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

1071
02:05:54,450 --> 02:05:55,781
Checkmate.

1072
02:06:15,738 --> 02:06:18,407
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1073
02:06:18,407 --> 02:06:22,478
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1074
02:06:22,478 --> 02:06:24,378
I have to go on.

1075
02:06:24,914 --> 02:06:31,020
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1076
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:33,545
Not as good as you.

1077
02:06:34,390 --> 02:06:39,191
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1078
02:06:40,396 --> 02:06:46,062
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

1079
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:25,801
You?

1080
02:07:26,609 --> 02:07:30,613
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the--

1081
02:07:30,613 --> 02:07:33,916
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

1082
02:07:33,916 --> 02:07:37,219
Next to him, who would suspect...

1083
02:07:37,219 --> 02:07:41,357
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

1084
02:07:41,357 --> 02:07:46,929
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

1085
02:07:46,929 --> 02:07:49,762
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1086
02:07:50,266 --> 02:07:54,603
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1087
02:07:54,603 --> 02:07:57,039
...I would have succeeded.

1088
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:00,276
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1089
02:08:00,276 --> 02:08:02,645
Snape was trying to save me?

1090
02:08:02,645 --> 02:08:08,217
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

1091
02:08:08,217 --> 02:08:12,688
-Then you let the troll in!
-Very good, Potter, yes.

1092
02:08:12,688 --> 02:08:15,680
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

1093
02:08:16,258 --> 02:08:21,195
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1094
02:08:22,164 --> 02:08:25,656
He, of course, never trusted me again.

1095
02:08:26,635 --> 02:08:32,107
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1096
02:08:32,107 --> 02:08:36,378
I'm never alone. Never.

1097
02:08:36,378 --> 02:08:40,474
Now, what does this mirror do?

1098
02:08:42,017 --> 02:08:44,144
I see what I desire.

1099
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:49,325
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

1100
02:08:49,325 --> 02:08:51,452
Use the boy.

1101
02:08:52,294 --> 02:08:56,230
Come here, Potter! Now!

1102
02:09:08,277 --> 02:09:12,270
Tell me, what do you see?

1103
02:09:37,473 --> 02:09:40,109
What is it? What do you see?

1104
02:09:40,109 --> 02:09:45,481
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1105
02:09:45,481 --> 02:09:47,516
He lies.

1106
02:09:47,516 --> 02:09:51,420
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1107
02:09:51,420 --> 02:09:56,025
-Let me speak to him.
-Master, you are not strong enough.

1108
02:09:56,025 --> 02:10:00,086
I have strength enough for this.

1109
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:21,317
Harry Potter...

1110
02:10:21,317 --> 02:10:23,919
...we meet again.

1111
02:10:23,919 --> 02:10:25,521
Voldemort.

1112
02:10:25,521 --> 02:10:29,758
Yes. You see what I've become?

1113
02:10:29,758 --> 02:10:33,529
See what I must do to survive?

1114
02:10:33,529 --> 02:10:37,659
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1115
02:10:38,334 --> 02:10:41,870
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1116
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:45,741
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1117
02:10:45,741 --> 02:10:49,511
But there is something that can.

1118
02:10:49,511 --> 02:10:55,451
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

1119
02:10:55,451 --> 02:10:57,112
Stop him!

1120
02:11:02,091 --> 02:11:04,855
Don't be a fool.

1121
02:11:05,361 --> 02:11:08,731
Why suffer an horrific death...

1122
02:11:08,731 --> 02:11:12,568
...when you can join me and live?

1123
02:11:12,568 --> 02:11:13,660
Never!

1124
02:11:15,671 --> 02:11:20,438
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1125
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:24,713
Tell me, Harry...

1126
02:11:24,713 --> 02:11:28,851
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1127
02:11:28,851 --> 02:11:31,120
Together...

1128
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:34,089
...we can bring them back.

1129
02:11:34,089 --> 02:11:38,788
All I ask is for something in return.

1130
02:11:45,567 --> 02:11:48,627
That's it, Harry.

1131
02:11:49,571 --> 02:11:53,676
There is no good and evil.

1132
02:11:53,676 --> 02:11:56,879
There is only power...

1133
02:11:56,879 --> 02:12:00,975
...and those too weak to seek it.

1134
02:12:01,684 --> 02:12:07,122
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

1135
02:12:07,122 --> 02:12:09,386
Just give me the Stone!

1136
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:13,395
You liar!

1137
02:12:13,395 --> 02:12:15,522
Kill him!

1138
02:12:39,054 --> 02:12:44,390
-What is this magic?
-Fool, get the Stone!

1139
02:14:29,598 --> 02:14:32,158
Good afternoon, Harry.

1140
02:14:34,269 --> 02:14:38,941
-Tokens from your admirers?
-Admirers?

1141
02:14:38,941 --> 02:14:45,180
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

1142
02:14:45,180 --> 02:14:49,981
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

1143
02:14:52,287 --> 02:14:56,191
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1144
02:14:56,191 --> 02:14:59,228
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1145
02:14:59,228 --> 02:15:02,431
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1146
02:15:02,431 --> 02:15:07,300
Fine. They're both just fine.

1147
02:15:07,870 --> 02:15:10,973
-What happened to the Stone?
-Relax, dear boy.

1148
02:15:10,973 --> 02:15:14,309
The Stone has been destroyed.

1149
02:15:14,309 --> 02:15:18,513
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

1150
02:15:18,513 --> 02:15:22,718
...and agreed it was best all around.

1151
02:15:22,718 --> 02:15:26,518
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

1152
02:15:28,590 --> 02:15:34,263
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1153
02:15:34,263 --> 02:15:37,733
But yes, he will die.

1154
02:15:37,733 --> 02:15:40,335
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

1155
02:15:40,335 --> 02:15:43,138
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

1156
02:15:43,138 --> 02:15:47,476
You see, only a person...

1157
02:15:47,476 --> 02:15:51,647
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

1158
02:15:51,647 --> 02:15:56,243
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

1159
02:15:57,185 --> 02:16:00,923
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1160
02:16:00,923 --> 02:16:05,951
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

1161
02:16:07,362 --> 02:16:12,834
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

1162
02:16:12,834 --> 02:16:15,166
I'm afraid...

1163
02:16:16,571 --> 02:16:20,632
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1164
02:16:21,343 --> 02:16:24,112
Harry, do you know why...

1165
02:16:24,112 --> 02:16:28,317
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1166
02:16:28,317 --> 02:16:32,981
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1167
02:16:33,488 --> 02:16:36,959
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1168
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:40,896
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1169
02:16:40,896 --> 02:16:45,856
-It lives in your very skin.
-What is it?

1170
02:16:46,702 --> 02:16:50,399
Love, Harry. Love.

1171
02:16:58,447 --> 02:17:02,851
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1172
02:17:02,851 --> 02:17:07,723
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1173
02:17:07,723 --> 02:17:11,259
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

1174
02:17:11,259 --> 02:17:14,863
But I think I could be safe...

1175
02:17:14,863 --> 02:17:17,195
...with a nice toffee.

1176
02:17:21,269 --> 02:17:22,861
Alas!

1177
02:17:23,538 --> 02:17:25,631
Earwax.

1178
02:17:40,922 --> 02:17:44,085
-All right there, Ron?
-All right. You?

1179
02:17:45,227 --> 02:17:47,889
All right. Hermione?

1180
02:17:48,597 --> 02:17:50,428
Never better.

1181
02:18:06,214 --> 02:18:08,705
Another year gone.

1182
02:18:09,451 --> 02:18:14,222
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

1183
02:18:14,222 --> 02:18:17,059
And the points stand thus:

1184
02:18:17,059 --> 02:18:22,793
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

1185
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:30,432
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

1186
02:18:35,710 --> 02:18:37,746
In second place...

1187
02:18:37,746 --> 02:18:42,547
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

1188
02:18:48,256 --> 02:18:50,292
And in first place...

1189
02:18:50,292 --> 02:18:55,696
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

1190
02:19:01,303 --> 02:19:03,464
Nice one, mate.

1191
02:19:07,342 --> 02:19:11,680
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

1192
02:19:11,680 --> 02:19:16,184
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

1193
02:19:16,184 --> 02:19:21,144
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

1194
02:19:21,790 --> 02:19:27,462
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

1195
02:19:27,462 --> 02:19:30,295
...while others were in grave peril...

1196
02:19:30,999 --> 02:19:33,229
...50 points.

1197
02:19:34,169 --> 02:19:35,466
Good job.

1198
02:19:43,145 --> 02:19:49,209
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

1199
02:19:49,718 --> 02:19:54,985
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

1200
02:19:59,594 --> 02:20:01,619
And third...

1201
02:20:02,197 --> 02:20:05,233
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

1202
02:20:05,233 --> 02:20:09,567
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

1203
02:20:10,138 --> 02:20:15,041
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

1204
02:20:23,351 --> 02:20:25,453
We're tied with Slytherin!

1205
02:20:25,453 --> 02:20:31,693
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

1206
02:20:31,693 --> 02:20:35,764
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

1207
02:20:35,764 --> 02:20:38,934
I award 10 points...

1208
02:20:38,934 --> 02:20:42,131
...to Neville Longbottom.

1209
02:20:55,483 --> 02:20:59,120
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

1210
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:03,648
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

1211
02:21:08,663 --> 02:21:12,030
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

1212
02:21:50,138 --> 02:21:53,675
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

1213
02:21:53,675 --> 02:21:57,907
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

1214
02:22:03,385 --> 02:22:06,684
-Come on, Harry.
-One minute.

1215
02:22:12,961 --> 02:22:16,658
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

1216
02:22:20,035 --> 02:22:21,730
This is for you.

1217
02:22:38,486 --> 02:22:40,579
Thanks, Hagrid.

1218
02:22:46,494 --> 02:22:51,299
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

1219
02:22:51,299 --> 02:22:55,970
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

1220
02:22:55,970 --> 02:22:58,907
...you could always threaten him...

1221
02:22:58,907 --> 02:23:02,010
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

1222
02:23:02,010 --> 02:23:07,482
But we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

1223
02:23:07,482 --> 02:23:11,851
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

1224
02:23:17,392 --> 02:23:20,729
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

1225
02:23:20,729 --> 02:23:23,031
I'm not going home.

1226
02:23:23,031 --> 02:23:24,931
Not really.
