1
00:00:54,136 --> 00:00:57,105
I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn 't it?

2
00:00:57,105 --> 00:01:01,610
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:05,480
... that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow,
maybe even hitting 1 00.

4
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,317
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...

5
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:11,320
... with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,050
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:16,916
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:22,330
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:25,866
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:27,235 --> 00:01:29,071
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:32,774
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:34,605
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,312
Beat up another 1 0-year-old?

14
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:39,803
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:44,786
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:50,053
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:52,227 --> 00:01:55,497
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:55,497 --> 00:01:57,158
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,904
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:05,134
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:09,077
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:09,077 --> 00:02:10,840
She dead?

23
00:02:12,014 --> 00:02:13,641
Is she dead?

24
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:15,514
Is she a dead Pott--?

25
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:31,528
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:36,438
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:36,438 --> 00:02:39,574
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:39,574 --> 00:02:41,098
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,394
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:10,463
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:42,091
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,370
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,736
They might come back.

34
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,143
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:04:55,143 --> 00:04:59,281
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know--?

36
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:01,650
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,220
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,224
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:12,060
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,896
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:18,200
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,864
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,816
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:34,816 --> 00:05:37,118
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:39,354
Diddykins?

46
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:41,379
Is that you?

47
00:05:44,593 --> 00:05:47,721
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:51,099
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:53,226
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,402
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:03,578
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:06,548
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:06,548 --> 00:06:11,219
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,421
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:17,255
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:33,441
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:38,847
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,818
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:46,021
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:50,258
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:50,258 --> 00:06:52,827
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:56,285
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:56,998 --> 00:07:01,401
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,872
Justice.

65
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:22,316
He's not very well.

66
00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:36,632
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:46,007
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:48,874
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:54,849
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:57,875
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:03,658
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:06,261
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:07,429
But the letter said--

74
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:10,632
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:12,967
- ...pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:16,504
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:18,973
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:22,807
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:32,279
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:24,095
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,607
Come on.

82
00:11:07,048 --> 00:11:08,811
In you go, son.

83
00:11:10,351 --> 00:11:12,020
There've been no sightings.

84
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,922
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:13,922 --> 00:11:16,958
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough....

86
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,894
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important....

87
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:25,767
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:30,338
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Well, tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:33,708
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.

90
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:37,045
- His instinct would be to ignore it--
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:41,482
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:45,453 --> 00:11:47,751
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,882
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:56,397 --> 00:12:00,301
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:12:00,301 --> 00:12:05,807
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:07,240
Yeah.

97
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,882
Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:19,921
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:22,219
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:26,249
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:41,576
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:45,146
Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:47,740
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,252
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:56,057 --> 00:13:00,061
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:03,064
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:07,435
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

108
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:09,771
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:09,771 --> 00:13:12,467
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:15,602
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:17,512 --> 00:13:19,614
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:19,614 --> 00:13:22,310
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:13:23,117 --> 00:13:24,786
It's a secret society.

114
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:27,522
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:30,082
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:32,953
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:37,398
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

118
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:38,566
- Only....
- Only what?

119
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,763
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:45,266
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:49,977
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:49,977 --> 00:13:52,113
I'm the one who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:52,113 --> 00:13:55,116
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:57,485
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:57,485 --> 00:14:01,723
- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out.
- lf you're all done shouting....

126
00:14:01,723 --> 00:14:04,214
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:05,526 --> 00:14:09,030
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn 't for Harry...

128
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,265
...we wouldn 't even know
Voldemort was back.

129
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:13,000
He 's not a child, Molly.

130
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,670
But he 's not an adult either.

131
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,773
- He 's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he 's not your son.

132
00:14:18,773 --> 00:14:21,309
He 's as good as.

133
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:23,177
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:25,780
- He 's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,050
Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon,
just like his godfather.

136
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,985
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,221
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:35,256
--about your supposed reformation.

139
00:14:35,256 --> 00:14:38,159
- I know better.
- So why don 't you tell him?

140
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:40,027
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,063
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:44,398
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:44,398 --> 00:14:46,662
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:52,299
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,203
Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,647
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

147
00:14:59,647 --> 00:15:02,850
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,442
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,321
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:10,124
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:12,285
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:16,292
Sirius.

153
00:15:22,036 --> 00:15:24,472
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:15:24,472 --> 00:15:28,309
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:31,745
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,081
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,486
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:56,637
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:59,807
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:59,807 --> 00:16:01,275
Why?

161
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:03,411
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,713
No one in their right mind
could believe that--

163
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:08,749
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:11,274
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:12,954 --> 00:16:15,556
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:15,556 --> 00:16:18,159
The last time Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,662
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:25,766
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:28,701
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:16:29,971 --> 00:16:34,635
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

171
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,613
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:43,175
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:47,811
He's been recruiting heavily,
and we've been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:48,756 --> 00:16:52,522
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:57,294
We believe...

176
00:16:58,266 --> 00:17:00,401
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:01,493
Sirius.

178
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:08,006
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:11,679
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,917
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:18,886
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

182
00:17:18,886 --> 00:17:22,686
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:37,204
Harry.

184
00:17:37,204 --> 00:17:39,640
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,438
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:53,721
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:56,019
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:15,038
Here we are.

189
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:21,304
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

190
00:18:22,016 --> 00:18:26,350
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:09,430
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,900
Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,892
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:40,656
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:19:43,297 --> 00:19:45,032
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:48,991
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:54,141 --> 00:19:57,745
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:57,745 --> 00:20:01,515
- They've changed the time of your hearing.
- When is it?

199
00:20:01,515 --> 00:20:03,380
In five minutes.

200
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:14,289
Department of Mysteries.

201
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:21,135
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

202
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:23,228
Yes, but we must be--

203
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:33,981
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

204
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:37,818
Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong.

205
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:41,083
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

206
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:42,954
Yes?

207
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,423
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

208
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:49,825
Good luck, Harry.

209
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:56,470
Disciplinary hearing
of the 1 2th of August...

210
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,573
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

211
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:03,377
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

212
00:21:03,377 --> 00:21:06,647
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag--

213
00:21:06,647 --> 00:21:08,649
Witness for the defense.

214
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:12,153
Albus Percival Wulfric...

215
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:15,856
...Brian Dumbledore.

216
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:19,293
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

217
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:22,029
- ...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

218
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:25,965
But by a happy mistake,
I arrived at the Ministry three hours early.

219
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:30,304
The charges?

220
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:33,007
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

221
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,808
"That he did knowingly...

222
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:38,546
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

223
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:41,715
...produce a Patronus Charm...

224
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:45,119
...in the presence of a Muggle."

225
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,589
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but--

226
00:21:48,589 --> 00:21:52,226
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

227
00:21:52,226 --> 00:21:55,262
- ...while under the age of 1 7?
- Yes, I was, but--

228
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:58,799
Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot--

229
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,029
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

230
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:05,398
Dementors?

231
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:07,875
In Little Whinging?

232
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,377
That's quite clever.

233
00:22:10,377 --> 00:22:13,781
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

234
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:16,083
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

235
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,819
- There were two of them, and if I hadn't--
- Enough.

236
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:23,190
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would
have been a very well-rehearsed story...

237
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,861
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event--

238
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:32,457
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

239
00:22:35,803 --> 00:22:38,897
Please describe the attack.

240
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:43,472
What did they look like?

241
00:22:44,044 --> 00:22:49,482
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

242
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:53,554
Not the boys. The Dementors.

243
00:22:53,554 --> 00:22:57,217
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

244
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:03,021
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

245
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:07,234
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

246
00:23:07,234 --> 00:23:12,506
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

247
00:23:12,506 --> 00:23:16,310
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

248
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,212
I don't think anyone would believe...

249
00:23:18,212 --> 00:23:21,238
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

250
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:26,820
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

251
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,493
Dementors are, after all,
under the control of the Ministry of Magic.

252
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:36,864
And it's so silly of me,
but it sounded for a moment as though...

253
00:23:36,864 --> 00:23:41,035
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

254
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:44,004
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

255
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:48,342
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

256
00:23:48,342 --> 00:23:51,879
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

257
00:23:51,879 --> 00:23:55,246
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

258
00:23:56,116 --> 00:23:58,686
Of course, there is someone...

259
00:23:58,686 --> 00:24:01,280
...who might be behind the attack.

260
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:09,096
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

261
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:13,834
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

262
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,598
He is not back.

263
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:24,704
In the matter of Harry Potter...

264
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,948
...the law clearly states...

265
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:32,519
...that magic may be used before Muggles
in life-threatening situations.

266
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,589
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

267
00:24:35,589 --> 00:24:38,926
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

268
00:24:38,926 --> 00:24:41,793
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

269
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:53,765
Those in favor of conviction?

270
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:07,520
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

271
00:25:21,635 --> 00:25:23,899
Cleared of all charges.

272
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,669
Professor.

273
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:44,858
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

274
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:47,224
You'll blow the entire operation.

275
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:58,439
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you....

276
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:01,033
I had to see you off, didn't l?

277
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:05,546
What's life without a little risk?

278
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:08,048
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

279
00:26:08,048 --> 00:26:09,950
Don't worry about me.

280
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:14,944
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

281
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:23,353
Original Order of the Phoenix.

282
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,799
Marlene McKinnon.

283
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:28,735
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

284
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:32,339
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

285
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:34,308
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

286
00:26:34,308 --> 00:26:35,976
Neville's parents.

287
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:39,639
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

288
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:44,050
It's been 1 4 years.

289
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:49,083
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

290
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,422
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

291
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:02,125
It feels like it did before.

292
00:27:06,373 --> 00:27:08,642
You keep it.

293
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:13,045
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

294
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:17,251
I'll see you at the train.

295
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,276
Bye-bye, darling.

296
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:21,654
I love you.

297
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:24,691
Hold my hand, lovey.

298
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:27,127
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

299
00:27:27,127 --> 00:27:28,424
Bye.

300
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:13,740
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

301
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,375
Better enjoy it while you can.

302
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:18,674
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

303
00:28:21,281 --> 00:28:25,240
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

304
00:28:26,453 --> 00:28:28,284
It's only Malfoy.

305
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,953
What'd you expect?

306
00:28:50,944 --> 00:28:52,279
Hi, guys.

307
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:53,940
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

308
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:08,518
What is it?

309
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:13,962
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

310
00:29:14,801 --> 00:29:17,099
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

311
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:19,968
It's pulling itself, like always.

312
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:35,817
You're not going mad.

313
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:40,622
I can see them too.

314
00:29:41,895 --> 00:29:44,489
You're just as sane as I am.

315
00:29:49,302 --> 00:29:51,361
Everyone, this is Loony Love--

316
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:56,074
Luna Lovegood.

317
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:02,345
What an interesting necklace.

318
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:05,044
It's a charm, actually.

319
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,012
Keeps away the Nargles.

320
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:13,282
Hungry.

321
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,928
I hope there's pudding.

322
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,525
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

323
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:34,838
Good evening, children.

324
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:39,052
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

325
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:42,255
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

326
00:30:42,255 --> 00:30:44,991
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

327
00:30:44,991 --> 00:30:48,449
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

328
00:30:49,296 --> 00:30:53,467
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

329
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:56,937
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

330
00:30:56,937 --> 00:31:00,668
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

331
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:06,469
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you--

332
00:31:17,557 --> 00:31:20,460
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

333
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,160
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

334
00:31:27,534 --> 00:31:31,371
And how lovely to see all your bright...

335
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:34,574
...happy faces smiling up at me.

336
00:31:34,574 --> 00:31:39,946
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

337
00:31:39,946 --> 00:31:42,176
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

338
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:48,155
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

339
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:54,127
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

340
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:56,563
Although each headmaster...

341
00:31:56,563 --> 00:32:01,398
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

342
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:09,101
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

343
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:13,847
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

344
00:32:13,847 --> 00:32:17,517
...perfect what can be perfected...

345
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:24,116
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

346
00:32:31,198 --> 00:32:35,468
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

347
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:39,837
- llluminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

348
00:32:40,574 --> 00:32:42,909
Magic is forbidden in the corridors....

349
00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:46,470
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

350
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,301
Dean, Seamus.

351
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:10,804
- Good holiday?
- All right.

352
00:33:10,804 --> 00:33:13,034
Better than Seamus', anyway.

353
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:16,843
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

354
00:33:16,843 --> 00:33:20,580
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

355
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,117
The Daily Prophet's been saying
a lot of things about you and Dumbledore.

356
00:33:24,117 --> 00:33:25,619
What, your mum believes them?

357
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:27,687
Nobody was there the night Cedric died.

358
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:30,957
I guess you should read the Prophet, then,
like your stupid mother.

359
00:33:30,957 --> 00:33:34,628
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar.

360
00:33:34,628 --> 00:33:37,297
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

361
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:40,567
Do you believe the rubbish he's come out
with about You-Know-Who?

362
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:42,194
Yeah. I do.

363
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:45,170
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

364
00:33:54,614 --> 00:33:57,183
- You all right?
- Fine.

365
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:59,981
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

366
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:04,319
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

367
00:34:07,994 --> 00:34:12,397
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

368
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,849
Harry.

369
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,471
Bring it over here. Over here.

370
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:03,247
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

371
00:35:18,898 --> 00:35:20,297
Good morning, children.

372
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:27,640
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

373
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,410
O-W-Ls.

374
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:35,148
More commonly known as OWLs.

375
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:38,618
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

376
00:35:38,618 --> 00:35:43,885
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

377
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:54,701
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

378
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:57,003
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

379
00:35:57,003 --> 00:36:00,673
...you will be following
a carefully structured, Ministry-approved...

380
00:36:00,673 --> 00:36:03,369
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

381
00:36:04,711 --> 00:36:07,480
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

382
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,182
Using spells?

383
00:36:09,182 --> 00:36:12,640
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

384
00:36:14,354 --> 00:36:16,122
We're not gonna use magic?

385
00:36:16,122 --> 00:36:21,294
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

386
00:36:21,294 --> 00:36:24,230
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

387
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,165
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

388
00:36:30,804 --> 00:36:33,373
It is the view of the Ministry...

389
00:36:33,373 --> 00:36:36,309
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

390
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:38,445
...to get you through your examinations...

391
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:41,047
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

392
00:36:41,047 --> 00:36:44,017
And how's theory supposed to prepare us
for what's out there?

393
00:36:44,017 --> 00:36:46,219
There is nothing out there, dear.

394
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:49,422
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

395
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:52,687
Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort.

396
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:07,863
Now, let me make this quite plain.

397
00:37:08,408 --> 00:37:10,043
You have been told...

398
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:15,582
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

399
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:20,887
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

400
00:37:20,887 --> 00:37:22,689
Detention, Mr. Potter.

401
00:37:22,689 --> 00:37:25,024
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

402
00:37:25,024 --> 00:37:27,627
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

403
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:29,963
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

404
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:31,430
Enough!

405
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:33,967
Enough.

406
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:38,267
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

407
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:04,223
Come in.

408
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:11,403
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

409
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:13,300
Sit.

410
00:38:21,014 --> 00:38:25,084
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

411
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:27,187
No, not with your quill.

412
00:38:27,187 --> 00:38:30,384
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

413
00:38:35,528 --> 00:38:36,927
Now...

414
00:38:37,897 --> 00:38:43,767
...I want you to write,
"l must not tell lies."

415
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:48,174
How many times?

416
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:52,838
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

417
00:38:54,847 --> 00:38:56,683
You haven't given me any ink.

418
00:38:56,683 --> 00:38:58,173
Oh, you won't need any ink.

419
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:50,925
Yes?

420
00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:01,645
- Nothing.
- That's right.

421
00:40:02,548 --> 00:40:06,686
Because you know, deep down...

422
00:40:06,686 --> 00:40:08,745
...you deserve to be punished.

423
00:40:09,922 --> 00:40:12,083
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

424
00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:17,921
Go on.

425
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:29,409
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

426
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:31,210
Get out of class whenever you like.

427
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,976
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

428
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:37,483
Care for another?

429
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:40,186
- I'm not asking you to write all of it for me.
- Please.

430
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:43,623
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

431
00:40:43,623 --> 00:40:45,591
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

432
00:40:45,591 --> 00:40:49,529
Hermione, you're honestly
the most wonderful person I've ever met.

433
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:53,761
- And if I'm ever rude to you again....
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

434
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:00,898
What's wrong with your hand?

435
00:41:01,441 --> 00:41:02,908
Nothing.

436
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:06,077
The other hand.

437
00:41:08,581 --> 00:41:10,583
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

438
00:41:10,583 --> 00:41:12,952
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

439
00:41:12,952 --> 00:41:15,254
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

440
00:41:15,254 --> 00:41:17,857
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

441
00:41:17,857 --> 00:41:21,793
- lf the parents knew about this....
- I haven't got any of those, have l, Ron?

442
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:27,233
Harry, you've got to report this.

443
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:30,937
- It's perfectly simple. You're being--
- No, it's not.

444
00:41:30,937 --> 00:41:33,770
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

445
00:41:34,807 --> 00:41:36,832
You don't understand.

446
00:41:39,445 --> 00:41:41,379
Then help us to.

447
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,960
Dear Padfoot...

448
00:41:58,498 --> 00:42:00,400
...I hope you're all right.

449
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,996
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

450
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,373
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

451
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:16,545
I know you, of all people,
will understand.

452
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,845
Hello, Harry Potter.

453
00:42:55,488 --> 00:43:00,118
- Your feet. Aren ' t they cold?
- Bit.

454
00:43:01,027 --> 00:43:05,054
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

455
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:08,691
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

456
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:18,670
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

457
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:24,408
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit....

458
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:28,980
Different.

459
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:34,627
But why can't the others see them?

460
00:43:34,627 --> 00:43:38,154
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

461
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:43,069
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

462
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:44,696
My mum.

463
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:50,309
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

464
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:53,779
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

465
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:56,179
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

466
00:43:56,749 --> 00:43:59,118
Yes, it was rather horrible.

467
00:43:59,118 --> 00:44:04,454
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

468
00:44:06,692 --> 00:44:09,320
We both believe you, by the way.

469
00:44:12,398 --> 00:44:15,568
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back,
and you fought him...

470
00:44:15,568 --> 00:44:18,838
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

471
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:23,376
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

472
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:24,707
I don't think that's true.

473
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:30,383
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

474
00:44:30,383 --> 00:44:32,146
What do you mean?

475
00:44:32,785 --> 00:44:35,121
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

476
00:44:35,121 --> 00:44:38,858
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

477
00:44:38,858 --> 00:44:41,588
...because if it's just you alone...

478
00:44:42,428 --> 00:44:44,760
...you're not as much of a threat.

479
00:45:02,415 --> 00:45:07,148
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

480
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:11,581
Harry.

481
00:45:13,426 --> 00:45:14,654
Can I join you?

482
00:45:16,562 --> 00:45:19,865
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

483
00:45:19,865 --> 00:45:22,802
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

484
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:27,239
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

485
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:29,075
So silly of me, but it sounds...

486
00:45:29,075 --> 00:45:33,379
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

487
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:34,880
...Minerva.

488
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:39,619
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

489
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:42,254
I am sorry, dear.

490
00:45:42,254 --> 00:45:45,758
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

491
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:49,061
...and by extension, the minister himself.

492
00:45:49,061 --> 00:45:50,830
I am a tolerant woman...

493
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:55,893
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

494
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,433
Disloyalty.

495
00:46:01,173 --> 00:46:05,311
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

496
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,769
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

497
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:22,261
What's happened to Dumbledore?

498
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:24,997
Having already revolutionized...

499
00:46:24,997 --> 00:46:27,659
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

500
00:46:29,335 --> 00:46:32,793
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...

501
00:46:35,307 --> 00:46:39,471
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

502
00:46:47,253 --> 00:46:49,588
Just one question, dear.

503
00:46:49,588 --> 00:46:53,786
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

504
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:05,871
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

505
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:08,274
Yes.

506
00:47:08,274 --> 00:47:10,902
But you were unsuccessful?

507
00:47:12,111 --> 00:47:14,545
Obviously.

508
00:47:46,879 --> 00:47:50,315
Could you please predict something
for me?

509
00:47:52,051 --> 00:47:53,245
I'm sorry?

510
00:47:58,491 --> 00:48:00,686
Move those mouths.

511
00:48:06,832 --> 00:48:09,926
One teensy little prophecy?

512
00:48:15,808 --> 00:48:17,241
Pity.

513
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:20,379
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

514
00:48:20,379 --> 00:48:22,848
Yes, I do. Something dark.

515
00:48:22,848 --> 00:48:27,376
You are in grave danger.

516
00:48:28,854 --> 00:48:30,583
Lovely.

517
00:48:40,766 --> 00:48:43,102
Cho. What's going on?

518
00:48:43,102 --> 00:48:45,434
It's Professor Trelawney.

519
00:49:15,267 --> 00:49:18,938
Sixteen years I've lived and taught here.

520
00:49:18,938 --> 00:49:21,873
Hogwarts is my home.

521
00:49:23,776 --> 00:49:25,676
You can't do this.

522
00:49:27,112 --> 00:49:29,376
Actually, I can.

523
00:49:38,257 --> 00:49:39,792
Something you'd like to say?

524
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:42,454
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

525
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:44,586
There....

526
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:03,174
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

527
00:50:04,483 --> 00:50:07,119
Sybil, dear. This way.

528
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,609
Thank you.

529
00:50:09,788 --> 00:50:13,993
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

530
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:17,429
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister--

531
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:20,766
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

532
00:50:20,766 --> 00:50:24,503
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

533
00:50:24,503 --> 00:50:27,529
That power remains with the headmaster.

534
00:50:29,541 --> 00:50:30,803
For now.

535
00:50:37,249 --> 00:50:39,418
Don't you all have studying to do?

536
00:50:39,418 --> 00:50:40,578
Professor.

537
00:50:42,421 --> 00:50:43,989
Professor?

538
00:50:43,989 --> 00:50:46,959
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

539
00:50:46,959 --> 00:50:49,086
Professor Dumbledore.

540
00:50:59,772 --> 00:51:01,865
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

541
00:51:02,408 --> 00:51:07,813
We're not learning how to defend ourselves.
We're not learning how to pass our OWLs.

542
00:51:07,813 --> 00:51:10,015
She's taking over the entire school.

543
00:51:10,015 --> 00:51:14,853
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

544
00:51:14,853 --> 00:51:17,856
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

545
00:51:17,856 --> 00:51:20,893
... that these disappearances
are the work...

546
00:51:20,893 --> 00:51:24,294
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

547
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,832
Harry.

548
00:51:26,832 --> 00:51:28,527
Sirius.

549
00:51:29,268 --> 00:51:32,137
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

550
00:51:32,137 --> 00:51:35,207
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

551
00:51:35,207 --> 00:51:37,309
Training you to kill half-breeds?

552
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:40,646
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

553
00:51:40,646 --> 00:51:44,883
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

554
00:51:44,883 --> 00:51:45,872
Combat?

555
00:51:46,385 --> 00:51:49,455
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

556
00:51:49,455 --> 00:51:51,023
That's exactly what he thinks.

557
00:51:51,023 --> 00:51:54,959
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

558
00:51:55,494 --> 00:51:59,164
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

559
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:02,622
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

560
00:52:03,168 --> 00:52:06,171
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

561
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:08,974
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

562
00:52:08,974 --> 00:52:12,967
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

563
00:52:13,779 --> 00:52:17,516
Voldemort is on the move.

564
00:52:17,516 --> 00:52:18,915
Well, what can we do?

565
00:52:19,518 --> 00:52:21,120
Someone's coming.

566
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:23,489
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

567
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:28,483
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

568
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:42,371
He really is out there, isn't he?

569
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:46,871
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

570
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:51,212
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how,
we need someone who will.

571
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:10,394
Harry.

572
00:53:19,978 --> 00:53:22,514
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

573
00:53:22,514 --> 00:53:23,916
I'm a nutter, remember?

574
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:28,654
Look on the bright side:
you can't be any worse than old toad face.

575
00:53:28,654 --> 00:53:32,112
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

576
00:53:32,624 --> 00:53:35,127
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

577
00:53:35,127 --> 00:53:37,254
Just a couple of people.

578
00:53:42,267 --> 00:53:43,700
Lovely spot.

579
00:53:47,406 --> 00:53:49,708
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

580
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,869
Matey, come back here.

581
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:01,887
Hi.

582
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:04,957
So you all know why we're here.

583
00:54:04,957 --> 00:54:06,185
We need a teacher.

584
00:54:07,893 --> 00:54:10,362
A proper teacher.

585
00:54:10,362 --> 00:54:13,699
One who's had experience
defending themselves against the Dark Arts.

586
00:54:13,699 --> 00:54:15,634
- Why?
- Why?

587
00:54:15,634 --> 00:54:17,870
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

588
00:54:17,870 --> 00:54:19,605
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

589
00:54:19,605 --> 00:54:21,907
So Dumbledore says because he says.

590
00:54:21,907 --> 00:54:24,307
The point is, where's the proof?

591
00:54:25,677 --> 00:54:28,703
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed....

592
00:54:31,817 --> 00:54:35,754
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

593
00:54:35,754 --> 00:54:39,358
Come on, Hermione. They're here because
they think I'm some sort of freak.

594
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:41,986
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

595
00:54:45,297 --> 00:54:46,730
Yes.

596
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,801
I've seen it.

597
00:54:49,801 --> 00:54:51,928
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

598
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:56,909
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

599
00:54:56,909 --> 00:54:58,310
It's true.

600
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:01,074
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

601
00:55:02,381 --> 00:55:05,350
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

602
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:06,647
Wait.

603
00:55:07,352 --> 00:55:12,057
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

604
00:55:12,057 --> 00:55:15,894
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

605
00:55:15,894 --> 00:55:19,798
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

606
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:23,290
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

607
00:55:25,871 --> 00:55:30,535
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

608
00:55:31,577 --> 00:55:35,180
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

609
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,670
But out there...

610
00:55:37,282 --> 00:55:40,752
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

611
00:55:40,752 --> 00:55:44,449
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes....

612
00:55:47,226 --> 00:55:49,023
You don't know what that's like.

613
00:55:58,804 --> 00:56:00,704
You're right, Harry, we don't.

614
00:56:01,473 --> 00:56:03,742
That's why we need your help.

615
00:56:03,742 --> 00:56:06,643
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

616
00:56:08,847 --> 00:56:10,007
...Voldemort....

617
00:56:13,452 --> 00:56:15,181
He's really back.

618
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:39,344
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

619
00:56:39,344 --> 00:56:40,912
...where Umbridge won't find out.

620
00:56:40,912 --> 00:56:43,248
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

621
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:46,385
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

622
00:56:46,385 --> 00:56:48,654
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

623
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:49,814
Who cares?

624
00:56:50,422 --> 00:56:55,460
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

625
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,724
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

626
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:02,267
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

627
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:03,564
What's that?

628
00:57:05,304 --> 00:57:07,966
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

629
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:13,945
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

630
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:16,948
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

631
00:57:16,948 --> 00:57:20,952
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.

632
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:22,783
Will do, Harry.

633
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:35,834
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

634
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:39,638
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

635
00:57:39,638 --> 00:57:42,106
Watch where you're going, Longbottom.

636
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:22,247
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

637
00:58:22,247 --> 00:58:23,548
The what?

638
00:58:23,548 --> 00:58:26,118
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

639
00:58:26,118 --> 00:58:29,721
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

640
00:58:29,721 --> 00:58:32,557
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

641
00:58:32,557 --> 00:58:36,288
So say you really needed the toilet....

642
00:58:37,462 --> 00:58:42,467
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

643
00:58:42,467 --> 00:58:47,336
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

644
00:58:58,383 --> 00:58:59,873
Expelliarmus.

645
00:59:05,023 --> 00:59:06,591
I'm hopeless.

646
00:59:06,591 --> 00:59:10,357
You're just flourishing your wand too much.
Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

647
00:59:13,732 --> 00:59:17,936
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

648
00:59:17,936 --> 00:59:21,306
...to ensure maximum retention.

649
00:59:21,306 --> 00:59:25,177
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

650
00:59:25,177 --> 00:59:27,202
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

651
00:59:40,158 --> 00:59:43,395
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

652
00:59:43,395 --> 00:59:45,797
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

653
00:59:45,797 --> 00:59:49,358
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

654
00:59:55,874 --> 00:59:57,273
Stupefy!

655
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,617
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

656
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:14,459
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

657
01:00:14,459 --> 01:00:16,450
Thanks, Ronald.

658
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:21,500
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

659
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,367
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

660
01:00:24,903 --> 01:00:26,928
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

661
01:00:33,979 --> 01:00:35,344
Stupefy.

662
01:00:41,019 --> 01:00:43,388
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

663
01:00:43,388 --> 01:00:47,984
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

664
01:00:50,228 --> 01:00:52,753
It was completely intentional.

665
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:21,325
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

666
01:01:23,628 --> 01:01:27,587
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

667
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:30,134
Expelliarmus.

668
01:01:31,703 --> 01:01:34,263
Very good. Keep your concentration.

669
01:01:36,374 --> 01:01:37,864
Great.

670
01:01:39,144 --> 01:01:40,736
A little higher.

671
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,053
I'm okay. I'm okay.

672
01:02:10,075 --> 01:02:12,703
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

673
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:17,816
Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad
for extra credit...

674
01:02:17,816 --> 01:02:20,852
...may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.

675
01:02:20,852 --> 01:02:22,479
Diminuendo.

676
01:02:28,393 --> 01:02:32,864
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

677
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:35,233
Believing in yourself.

678
01:02:35,233 --> 01:02:37,535
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

679
01:02:37,535 --> 01:02:39,270
Think of it this way.

680
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:43,608
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

681
01:02:43,608 --> 01:02:47,679
...as nothing more
than what we are now: students.

682
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:50,614
If they can do it, why not us?

683
01:03:00,759 --> 01:03:02,556
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

684
01:03:04,729 --> 01:03:06,094
Expelliarmus.

685
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,290
Expelliarmus.

686
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,137
Reducto.

687
01:03:30,655 --> 01:03:33,825
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

688
01:03:33,825 --> 01:03:36,191
Expelliarmus.

689
01:03:40,098 --> 01:03:42,157
Expelliarmus.

690
01:03:46,004 --> 01:03:49,405
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

691
01:03:51,042 --> 01:03:53,344
So that' s it for this lesson.

692
01:03:53,344 --> 01:03:57,148
Now, we' re not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

693
01:03:57,148 --> 01:04:00,351
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

694
01:04:00,351 --> 01:04:03,718
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

695
01:04:08,526 --> 01:04:10,128
Well done, mate.

696
01:04:10,128 --> 01:04:11,561
Thanks.

697
01:04:17,235 --> 01:04:19,601
See you after Christmas.

698
01:04:29,047 --> 01:04:31,106
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

699
01:04:32,517 --> 01:04:35,213
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

700
01:04:36,988 --> 01:04:39,824
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

701
01:04:39,824 --> 01:04:42,360
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

702
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,395
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

703
01:04:44,395 --> 01:04:47,165
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

704
01:04:47,165 --> 01:04:49,734
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

705
01:04:49,734 --> 01:04:52,570
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils--

706
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:55,095
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

707
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:10,955
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

708
01:05:10,955 --> 01:05:13,321
Yeah. I'm okay.

709
01:05:14,025 --> 01:05:16,823
Anyway, it's worth it.

710
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:25,330
It's just, learning all this...

711
01:05:26,137 --> 01:05:29,741
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it....

712
01:05:29,741 --> 01:05:32,471
Cedric did know this stuff.

713
01:05:33,044 --> 01:05:35,444
He was really good.

714
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,810
It's just, Voldemort was better.

715
01:05:43,354 --> 01:05:45,151
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

716
01:05:46,424 --> 01:05:49,325
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

717
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:00,130
Mistletoe.

718
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:05,575
Probably full of Nargles, though.

719
01:06:06,644 --> 01:06:08,339
What are Nargles?

720
01:06:09,047 --> 01:06:10,776
No idea.

721
01:06:32,804 --> 01:06:34,999
Well, how was it?

722
01:06:35,773 --> 01:06:37,942
Wet.

723
01:06:37,942 --> 01:06:40,078
I mean, she was sort of crying.

724
01:06:40,078 --> 01:06:42,213
That bad at it, are you?

725
01:06:42,213 --> 01:06:44,943
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

726
01:06:47,785 --> 01:06:50,121
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

727
01:06:50,121 --> 01:06:52,385
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

728
01:06:53,858 --> 01:06:56,725
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

729
01:07:01,132 --> 01:07:04,769
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

730
01:07:04,769 --> 01:07:08,006
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

731
01:07:08,006 --> 01:07:11,409
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

732
01:07:11,409 --> 01:07:15,140
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

733
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:20,818
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

734
01:07:20,818 --> 01:07:24,049
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon....

735
01:07:39,902 --> 01:07:41,529
Harry.

736
01:07:50,313 --> 01:07:53,373
Voldemort may be after something.

737
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:57,042
Something he didn 't have last time.

738
01:07:57,887 --> 01:07:59,149
Harry.

739
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:02,052
Harry.

740
01:08:33,156 --> 01:08:36,726
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

741
01:08:36,726 --> 01:08:38,695
...or looking down at the scene?

742
01:08:38,695 --> 01:08:41,664
Neither. It was like l....

743
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:44,500
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

744
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,003
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight.

745
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:49,572
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

746
01:08:49,572 --> 01:08:51,307
- Sir.
- Phineas.

747
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:53,776
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

748
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:56,579
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

749
01:08:56,579 --> 01:09:00,917
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

750
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:04,153
They've got him, Albus.
It was close, but they think he'll make it.

751
01:09:04,153 --> 01:09:06,856
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

752
01:09:06,856 --> 01:09:08,925
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to--

753
01:09:08,925 --> 01:09:10,119
Look at me!

754
01:09:16,632 --> 01:09:18,862
What's happening to me?

755
01:09:26,743 --> 01:09:28,778
You wished to see me, headmaster?

756
01:09:28,778 --> 01:09:34,083
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

757
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,984
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

758
01:09:41,758 --> 01:09:43,526
It appears there's a connection...

759
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:46,028
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

760
01:09:46,028 --> 01:09:50,566
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

761
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:53,770
Pray he remains ignorant.

762
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,507
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

763
01:09:57,507 --> 01:10:02,078
- ...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

764
01:10:02,078 --> 01:10:04,113
...unhinge it.

765
01:10:04,113 --> 01:10:07,650
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

766
01:10:07,650 --> 01:10:10,052
...to invade the minds of his victims...

767
01:10:10,052 --> 01:10:13,647
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

768
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:19,762
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

769
01:10:19,762 --> 01:10:24,200
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

770
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,428
...kill them.

771
01:10:26,402 --> 01:10:29,005
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

772
01:10:29,005 --> 01:10:32,675
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

773
01:10:32,675 --> 01:10:37,442
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

774
01:10:38,014 --> 01:10:41,384
You will attempt to resist.

775
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:42,851
Prepare yourself.

776
01:10:45,588 --> 01:10:46,816
Legilimens.

777
01:10:54,931 --> 01:10:58,526
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

778
01:11:24,427 --> 01:11:26,054
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

779
01:11:27,263 --> 01:11:30,099
Here we go.

780
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:32,260
Daddy's back.

781
01:11:35,438 --> 01:11:39,242
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

782
01:11:39,242 --> 01:11:43,611
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And....

783
01:11:46,415 --> 01:11:48,784
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

784
01:11:48,784 --> 01:11:51,254
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

785
01:11:51,254 --> 01:11:53,823
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

786
01:11:53,823 --> 01:11:58,294
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

787
01:11:58,294 --> 01:12:01,330
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

788
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:03,532
Oh, Harry, Harry.

789
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:05,432
There you are.

790
01:12:06,435 --> 01:12:08,266
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

791
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:10,873
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

792
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:13,009
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

793
01:12:13,009 --> 01:12:14,911
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

794
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:16,445
Fred? George?

795
01:12:16,445 --> 01:12:19,148
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

796
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:21,013
To Mr. Harry Potter...

797
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:24,884
...without whom I would not be here.

798
01:12:28,457 --> 01:12:30,960
- Harry.
- Harry.

799
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,188
Harry.

800
01:12:33,195 --> 01:12:35,965
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

801
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:38,331
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

802
01:12:39,268 --> 01:12:41,998
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

803
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:45,474
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

804
01:12:45,474 --> 01:12:47,510
No more than usual, Ron.

805
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,341
I don't know why....

806
01:12:55,351 --> 01:13:00,122
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.

807
01:13:00,122 --> 01:13:05,027
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

808
01:13:05,027 --> 01:13:08,464
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

809
01:13:08,464 --> 01:13:11,233
- lf my poor mistress only knew....
- Kreacher!

810
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:14,236
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

811
01:13:14,236 --> 01:13:16,405
Of course, master.

812
01:13:16,405 --> 01:13:21,104
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

813
01:13:23,412 --> 01:13:25,312
Sorry about that.

814
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:29,885
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

815
01:13:29,885 --> 01:13:31,978
Not to me, anyway.

816
01:13:32,822 --> 01:13:34,924
What, you grew up here?

817
01:13:34,924 --> 01:13:37,526
This is my parents' house.

818
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:41,360
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

819
01:13:42,498 --> 01:13:45,763
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

820
01:13:47,169 --> 01:13:49,535
This is the Black family tree.

821
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:52,742
My deranged cousin.

822
01:13:52,742 --> 01:13:55,644
I hated the lot of them.

823
01:13:55,644 --> 01:14:00,343
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

824
01:14:03,552 --> 01:14:07,352
My mother did that after I ran away.

825
01:14:09,692 --> 01:14:11,557
Charming woman.

826
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:14,455
I was 1 6.

827
01:14:15,297 --> 01:14:16,730
Where did you go?

828
01:14:18,801 --> 01:14:20,063
Round your dad's.

829
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:24,095
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

830
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:27,737
I see him so much in you, Harry.

831
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:30,572
You are so very much alike.

832
01:14:31,514 --> 01:14:33,482
I'm not so sure.

833
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:35,983
Sirius, when I was....

834
01:14:38,821 --> 01:14:43,349
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

835
01:14:44,493 --> 01:14:46,017
I was the snake.

836
01:14:46,862 --> 01:14:49,965
And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office...

837
01:14:49,965 --> 01:14:54,163
...there was a moment
when I wanted to--

838
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:02,175
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

839
01:15:02,845 --> 01:15:06,440
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

840
01:15:07,783 --> 01:15:12,855
I just feel so angry all the time.

841
01:15:12,855 --> 01:15:17,593
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

842
01:15:17,593 --> 01:15:21,154
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

843
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:27,030
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

844
01:15:28,237 --> 01:15:31,206
You're not a bad person.

845
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:36,410
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

846
01:15:37,012 --> 01:15:38,138
You understand?

847
01:15:40,249 --> 01:15:45,454
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

848
01:15:45,454 --> 01:15:49,914
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

849
01:15:50,659 --> 01:15:53,924
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

850
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:58,163
That's who we really are.

851
01:16:01,904 --> 01:16:03,667
Harry, time to go.

852
01:16:05,441 --> 01:16:09,879
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

853
01:16:09,879 --> 01:16:11,471
You'll see.

854
01:16:12,615 --> 01:16:13,980
Come on.

855
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:52,755
Really?

856
01:16:52,755 --> 01:16:55,558
Harry. Harry.

857
01:16:55,558 --> 01:16:57,492
Hagrid's back.

858
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:02,260
I'm sorry.

859
01:17:16,478 --> 01:17:19,949
I will say this one last time.

860
01:17:19,949 --> 01:17:22,484
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

861
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:25,854
I told you. I've been away for me health.

862
01:17:25,854 --> 01:17:30,192
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

863
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:35,027
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

864
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:39,735
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

865
01:17:39,735 --> 01:17:43,000
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

866
01:18:01,957 --> 01:18:05,051
This is top-secret, right?

867
01:18:05,961 --> 01:18:08,497
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

868
01:18:08,497 --> 01:18:09,987
Giants?

869
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:12,401
You found them?

870
01:18:12,401 --> 01:18:16,303
Well, they're not that hard to find,
to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

871
01:18:17,172 --> 01:18:20,376
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

872
01:18:20,376 --> 01:18:23,072
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

873
01:18:23,779 --> 01:18:26,148
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

874
01:18:26,148 --> 01:18:29,481
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

875
01:18:29,985 --> 01:18:32,521
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

876
01:18:32,521 --> 01:18:36,617
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.

877
01:18:40,229 --> 01:18:41,526
And they did this to you?

878
01:18:42,231 --> 01:18:43,994
Not exactly, no.

879
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:48,402
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

880
01:19:02,384 --> 01:19:04,953
It's changing out there.

881
01:19:04,953 --> 01:19:06,511
Just like last time.

882
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:09,617
There's a storm coming, Harry.

883
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:13,419
We'd all best be ready when she does.

884
01:19:50,432 --> 01:19:53,635
We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...

885
01:19:53,635 --> 01:19:56,638
...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.

886
01:19:56,638 --> 01:20:00,476
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.

887
01:20:00,476 --> 01:20:02,569
We strongly suspect...

888
01:20:03,412 --> 01:20:05,581
...that the breakout was engineered...

889
01:20:05,581 --> 01:20:09,952
... by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

890
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:14,184
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

891
01:20:15,624 --> 01:20:19,993
...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange.

892
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:32,775
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

893
01:20:32,775 --> 01:20:36,111
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

894
01:20:36,111 --> 01:20:37,237
Harry.

895
01:20:40,949 --> 01:20:42,940
I wanted to apologize.

896
01:20:43,552 --> 01:20:47,890
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

897
01:20:47,890 --> 01:20:53,795
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

898
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:02,328
Neville?

899
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:17,219
Fourteen years ago...

900
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:21,657
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

901
01:21:21,657 --> 01:21:24,854
...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents.

902
01:21:25,427 --> 01:21:29,565
She tortured them for information...

903
01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:31,726
...but they never gave in.

904
01:21:33,402 --> 01:21:35,893
I'm quite proud to be their son.

905
01:21:36,872 --> 01:21:40,740
But I'm not sure
I'm ready for everyone to know just yet.

906
01:21:46,682 --> 01:21:50,812
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

907
01:21:55,057 --> 01:21:58,927
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

908
01:21:58,927 --> 01:22:02,531
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

909
01:22:02,531 --> 01:22:03,930
George, your turn now.

910
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,598
Expecto Patronum.

911
01:22:08,537 --> 01:22:12,140
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

912
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:16,144
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

913
01:22:16,144 --> 01:22:17,372
Wow, that was really good.

914
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,815
Fantastic, Ginny.

915
01:22:19,815 --> 01:22:24,019
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

916
01:22:24,019 --> 01:22:26,317
So focus, Luna.

917
01:22:30,025 --> 01:22:31,894
Think of the happiest thing you can.

918
01:22:31,894 --> 01:22:34,029
Expecto Patronum.

919
01:22:34,029 --> 01:22:37,065
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

920
01:22:37,065 --> 01:22:41,331
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

921
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:44,470
Expecto Patronum.

922
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:28,840
I'll make short work of this.

923
01:23:30,185 --> 01:23:32,176
Bombarda Maxima.

924
01:23:50,472 --> 01:23:52,274
Get them.

925
01:23:52,274 --> 01:23:53,909
Been watching them for weeks.

926
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:56,278
And see, " Dumbledore's Army"...

927
01:23:56,278 --> 01:23:59,975
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

928
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,585
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

929
01:24:03,585 --> 01:24:05,287
...never fooled us for a minute.

930
01:24:05,287 --> 01:24:07,522
We saw your lies for what they were:

931
01:24:07,522 --> 01:24:11,526
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

932
01:24:11,526 --> 01:24:12,694
Naturally.

933
01:24:12,694 --> 01:24:15,397
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

934
01:24:15,397 --> 01:24:19,234
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

935
01:24:19,234 --> 01:24:24,239
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

936
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:27,042
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

937
01:24:27,042 --> 01:24:30,679
And l, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

938
01:24:30,679 --> 01:24:32,681
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

939
01:24:32,681 --> 01:24:35,384
If we hurry,
we should still make the morning edition.

940
01:24:35,384 --> 01:24:40,355
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

941
01:24:40,355 --> 01:24:41,788
...to Azkaban...

942
01:24:43,025 --> 01:24:48,363
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

943
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:51,298
I thought we might hit this little snag.

944
01:24:52,467 --> 01:24:55,903
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to--

945
01:24:56,471 --> 01:24:58,073
What was the phrase?

946
01:24:58,073 --> 01:24:59,841
--come quietly.

947
01:24:59,841 --> 01:25:01,977
Well, I can tell you this:

948
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:04,446
I have no intention of going to Azkaban.

949
01:25:04,446 --> 01:25:05,708
Enough of this.

950
01:25:06,214 --> 01:25:07,306
Take him.

951
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:24,700
Well, you may not like him, minister...

952
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:26,827
...but you can't deny...

953
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:30,099
...Dumbledore has got style.

954
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:59,000
Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.

955
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,604
Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit....

956
01:26:02,604 --> 01:26:07,809
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

957
01:26:07,809 --> 01:26:12,109
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

958
01:27:23,318 --> 01:27:24,910
Harry.

959
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:35,430
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

960
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:37,796
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

961
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,036
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

962
01:27:41,036 --> 01:27:43,305
Yeah, we talked you into it.

963
01:27:43,305 --> 01:27:45,273
Yeah, but I agreed.

964
01:27:45,841 --> 01:27:49,971
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.

965
01:27:52,013 --> 01:27:54,447
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

966
01:27:55,517 --> 01:27:59,888
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

967
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:02,724
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

968
01:28:02,724 --> 01:28:05,887
- So maybe it's just better to....
- To what?

969
01:28:08,129 --> 01:28:10,063
To go it alone.

970
01:28:16,404 --> 01:28:18,065
Hagrid.

971
01:28:21,810 --> 01:28:24,412
Any idea where he's taking us?

972
01:28:24,412 --> 01:28:27,472
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

973
01:28:35,790 --> 01:28:38,627
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

974
01:28:38,627 --> 01:28:41,187
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

975
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:44,633
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

976
01:28:44,633 --> 01:28:47,002
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

977
01:28:47,002 --> 01:28:48,837
Hagrid, what's going on?

978
01:28:48,837 --> 01:28:51,239
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

979
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:56,199
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

980
01:28:56,845 --> 01:29:00,181
...I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.

981
01:29:00,181 --> 01:29:03,673
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

982
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:09,516
Grawpy.

983
01:29:11,927 --> 01:29:14,020
Down here, you great buffoon.

984
01:29:20,368 --> 01:29:22,063
Grawpy.

985
01:29:22,837 --> 01:29:24,532
Brought you some company.

986
01:29:36,885 --> 01:29:39,321
I couldn't just leave him, because--

987
01:29:39,321 --> 01:29:41,222
Because he's my brother.

988
01:29:41,222 --> 01:29:42,524
Blimey.

989
01:29:42,524 --> 01:29:44,726
Well, half brother, really.

990
01:29:44,726 --> 01:29:49,993
He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.

991
01:29:52,133 --> 01:29:54,636
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

992
01:29:54,636 --> 01:29:57,205
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

993
01:29:57,205 --> 01:29:59,641
That's your new friend, Hermione.

994
01:29:59,641 --> 01:30:00,938
Grawpy.

995
01:30:05,246 --> 01:30:06,440
Grawp.

996
01:30:08,483 --> 01:30:11,543
Put me down.

997
01:30:15,223 --> 01:30:16,781
Now.

998
01:30:28,937 --> 01:30:30,029
You all right?

999
01:30:31,339 --> 01:30:33,408
Fine.

1000
01:30:33,408 --> 01:30:35,877
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1001
01:30:35,877 --> 01:30:38,277
I think you've got an admirer.

1002
01:30:40,782 --> 01:30:42,943
You just stay away from her, all right?

1003
01:31:13,081 --> 01:31:15,811
He gets his own food and all.

1004
01:31:17,085 --> 01:31:20,145
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1005
01:31:21,489 --> 01:31:23,719
You will look after him, won't you?

1006
01:31:24,225 --> 01:31:26,921
I'm the only family he's got.

1007
01:31:40,508 --> 01:31:42,373
Feeling sentimental?

1008
01:31:45,647 --> 01:31:49,784
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1009
01:31:49,784 --> 01:31:53,276
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1010
01:31:55,723 --> 01:31:59,060
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1011
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:03,190
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1012
01:32:04,365 --> 01:32:06,801
You're just like your father.

1013
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:08,770
Lazy, arrogant.

1014
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:11,172
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1015
01:32:11,172 --> 01:32:13,333
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1016
01:32:13,975 --> 01:32:16,077
Control your emotions.

1017
01:32:16,077 --> 01:32:19,012
Discipline your mind.

1018
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:23,044
Legilimens.

1019
01:32:30,258 --> 01:32:31,526
Harry.

1020
01:32:31,526 --> 01:32:33,255
Sirius.

1021
01:32:33,928 --> 01:32:35,563
I may vomit.

1022
01:32:35,563 --> 01:32:36,587
Stop it.

1023
01:32:37,732 --> 01:32:40,030
Is this what you call control?

1024
01:32:40,535 --> 01:32:43,771
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1025
01:32:43,771 --> 01:32:47,172
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1026
01:32:48,810 --> 01:32:50,879
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1027
01:32:50,879 --> 01:32:55,016
Sentimental children forever whining about
how bitterly unfair your lives have been.

1028
01:32:55,016 --> 01:32:58,553
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.

1029
01:32:58,553 --> 01:33:02,690
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1030
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:05,716
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1031
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:08,251
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

1032
01:33:13,835 --> 01:33:15,537
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1033
01:33:15,537 --> 01:33:17,772
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1034
01:33:17,772 --> 01:33:19,974
Nice one, James.

1035
01:33:19,974 --> 01:33:22,443
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.

1036
01:33:22,443 --> 01:33:24,612
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1037
01:33:24,612 --> 01:33:27,448
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly' s trousers?

1038
01:33:27,448 --> 01:33:29,884
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1039
01:33:29,884 --> 01:33:31,078
Enough.

1040
01:33:33,054 --> 01:33:34,646
Enough.

1041
01:33:43,164 --> 01:33:45,934
Your lessons are at an end.

1042
01:33:45,934 --> 01:33:47,235
I--

1043
01:33:47,235 --> 01:33:50,500
Get out.

1044
01:34:07,722 --> 01:34:10,058
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1045
01:34:10,058 --> 01:34:12,126
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1046
01:34:12,126 --> 01:34:15,330
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1047
01:34:15,330 --> 01:34:17,532
It's fading already.

1048
01:34:17,532 --> 01:34:22,265
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1049
01:34:29,644 --> 01:34:32,547
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1050
01:34:32,547 --> 01:34:36,313
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1051
01:34:39,387 --> 01:34:40,888
You know, George...

1052
01:34:40,888 --> 01:34:44,726
...I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1053
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:49,288
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1054
01:36:01,235 --> 01:36:02,896
All right, professor!

1055
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:13,442
Here you go.

1056
01:36:38,406 --> 01:36:40,237
Ready when you are.

1057
01:38:05,993 --> 01:38:09,430
I need that prophecy.

1058
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:11,227
You'll have to kill me.

1059
01:38:12,099 --> 01:38:16,838
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1060
01:38:16,838 --> 01:38:18,533
Crucio.

1061
01:38:21,075 --> 01:38:22,838
Crucio.

1062
01:38:34,222 --> 01:38:35,857
Sirius.

1063
01:38:35,857 --> 01:38:37,024
Harry, are you sure?

1064
01:38:37,024 --> 01:38:39,660
I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley.

1065
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:41,696
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1066
01:38:41,696 --> 01:38:43,931
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.

1067
01:38:43,931 --> 01:38:46,033
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1068
01:38:46,033 --> 01:38:49,504
Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.

1069
01:38:49,504 --> 01:38:51,438
Harry, please, just listen.

1070
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:54,931
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1071
01:38:56,244 --> 01:38:59,547
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1072
01:38:59,547 --> 01:39:03,217
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1073
01:39:03,217 --> 01:39:06,709
Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.

1074
01:39:09,323 --> 01:39:10,312
What do we do?

1075
01:39:11,726 --> 01:39:13,528
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1076
01:39:13,528 --> 01:39:15,763
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1077
01:39:15,763 --> 01:39:17,321
Not all of them.

1078
01:39:20,134 --> 01:39:21,465
Alohomora.

1079
01:39:32,713 --> 01:39:34,582
Alert the Order if you can.

1080
01:39:34,582 --> 01:39:38,319
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1081
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:42,123
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1082
01:39:42,123 --> 01:39:45,526
That you are.

1083
01:39:45,526 --> 01:39:48,393
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1084
01:39:53,401 --> 01:39:55,670
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?

1085
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:57,872
- No.
- Liar.

1086
01:39:57,872 --> 01:40:00,875
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1087
01:40:00,875 --> 01:40:04,779
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1088
01:40:04,779 --> 01:40:06,480
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1089
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,550
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1090
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:12,678
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1091
01:40:16,757 --> 01:40:18,392
Unless you wish to poison him--

1092
01:40:18,392 --> 01:40:22,829
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1093
01:40:23,431 --> 01:40:25,365
--I cannot help you.

1094
01:40:27,802 --> 01:40:29,497
He's got Padfoot.

1095
01:40:30,538 --> 01:40:34,508
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1096
01:40:34,508 --> 01:40:36,811
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1097
01:40:36,811 --> 01:40:38,335
What is he talking about, Snape?

1098
01:40:45,019 --> 01:40:47,010
No idea.

1099
01:40:51,525 --> 01:40:53,083
Very well.

1100
01:40:54,095 --> 01:40:56,797
You give me no choice, Potter.

1101
01:40:56,797 --> 01:40:59,934
As this is an issue of Ministry security...

1102
01:40:59,934 --> 01:41:01,993
...you leave me with...

1103
01:41:02,737 --> 01:41:04,705
...no alternative.

1104
01:41:05,506 --> 01:41:07,875
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1105
01:41:07,875 --> 01:41:09,043
That's illegal.

1106
01:41:09,043 --> 01:41:12,410
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1107
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,444
Tell her, Harry!

1108
01:41:22,957 --> 01:41:24,390
Tell me what?

1109
01:41:25,593 --> 01:41:27,584
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1110
01:41:28,262 --> 01:41:30,025
...I will.

1111
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:33,463
Where what is?

1112
01:41:34,669 --> 01:41:36,967
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1113
01:41:41,976 --> 01:41:43,678
How much further?

1114
01:41:43,678 --> 01:41:45,339
Not far.

1115
01:41:47,348 --> 01:41:51,045
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1116
01:41:55,389 --> 01:41:57,024
What are you doing?

1117
01:41:57,024 --> 01:41:58,821
Improvising.

1118
01:42:07,334 --> 01:42:08,926
Well?

1119
01:42:10,237 --> 01:42:12,364
Where is this weapon?

1120
01:42:17,278 --> 01:42:19,542
There isn't one, is there?

1121
01:42:22,316 --> 01:42:24,477
You were trying to trick me.

1122
01:42:28,689 --> 01:42:30,247
You know...

1123
01:42:31,659 --> 01:42:33,684
...I really hate children.

1124
01:42:49,276 --> 01:42:53,713
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1125
01:42:56,383 --> 01:42:58,219
Lower your weapons.

1126
01:42:58,219 --> 01:43:03,924
I warn you, under the law,
as creatures of near-human intelligence....

1127
01:43:03,924 --> 01:43:05,426
Protego.

1128
01:43:05,426 --> 01:43:06,552
How dare you?

1129
01:43:07,194 --> 01:43:08,718
Filthy half-breed.

1130
01:43:09,497 --> 01:43:10,486
Incarcerous.

1131
01:43:23,711 --> 01:43:26,480
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1132
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:31,144
Now, enough. I will have order.

1133
01:43:39,994 --> 01:43:42,730
You filthy animal.

1134
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:45,866
Do you know who I am?

1135
01:43:45,866 --> 01:43:48,869
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1136
01:43:48,869 --> 01:43:50,734
No, he doesn't understand.

1137
01:43:58,412 --> 01:44:02,049
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1138
01:44:02,049 --> 01:44:04,151
I'm sorry, professor.

1139
01:44:04,151 --> 01:44:06,120
But I must not tell lies.

1140
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:07,288
What are you doing?

1141
01:44:07,288 --> 01:44:11,592
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1142
01:44:11,592 --> 01:44:13,787
Let me go!

1143
01:44:16,463 --> 01:44:18,432
Thank you, Grawp.

1144
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:21,924
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1145
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:33,945
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1146
01:44:33,945 --> 01:44:36,247
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1147
01:44:36,247 --> 01:44:38,807
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1148
01:44:39,651 --> 01:44:41,141
That was clever, Ron.

1149
01:44:41,986 --> 01:44:44,656
- Has been known to happen.
- lt was brilliant.

1150
01:44:44,656 --> 01:44:46,453
So how are we getting to London?

1151
01:44:47,825 --> 01:44:51,352
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1152
01:44:52,196 --> 01:44:55,066
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1153
01:44:55,066 --> 01:44:58,369
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1154
01:44:58,369 --> 01:45:00,496
Or was that all just words to you?

1155
01:45:02,373 --> 01:45:05,570
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1156
01:45:10,481 --> 01:45:12,642
So how are we going to get to London?

1157
01:45:14,052 --> 01:45:16,282
We fly, of course.

1158
01:46:07,338 --> 01:46:09,499
Department of Mysteries.

1159
01:46:18,349 --> 01:46:20,044
This is it.

1160
01:47:13,037 --> 01:47:15,369
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1161
01:47:17,074 --> 01:47:18,439
Ninety-four.

1162
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:20,734
Ninety-five.

1163
01:47:33,291 --> 01:47:36,055
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1164
01:47:38,763 --> 01:47:40,060
It's got your name on it.

1165
01:48:05,256 --> 01:48:09,625
The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1166
01:48:10,461 --> 01:48:13,064
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...

1167
01:48:13,064 --> 01:48:15,862
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1168
01:48:21,505 --> 01:48:26,875
For neither can live
while the other survives.

1169
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:30,472
Harry.

1170
01:48:40,958 --> 01:48:42,627
Where's Sirius?

1171
01:48:42,627 --> 01:48:47,724
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1172
01:48:50,635 --> 01:48:52,796
...and reality.

1173
01:48:54,071 --> 01:48:59,008
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1174
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:01,379
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1175
01:49:01,379 --> 01:49:03,472
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1176
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:08,986
He knows how to play.

1177
01:49:08,986 --> 01:49:12,957
Itty, bitty baby.

1178
01:49:12,957 --> 01:49:14,185
Potter.

1179
01:49:14,725 --> 01:49:16,794
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1180
01:49:16,794 --> 01:49:19,897
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1181
01:49:19,897 --> 01:49:21,762
Better, now they're about to be avenged.

1182
01:49:24,602 --> 01:49:29,874
Now, let's everybody just calm down...

1183
01:49:29,874 --> 01:49:31,542
...shall we?

1184
01:49:31,542 --> 01:49:34,178
All we want is that prophecy.

1185
01:49:34,178 --> 01:49:36,547
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1186
01:49:36,547 --> 01:49:38,174
You dare speak his name?

1187
01:49:39,717 --> 01:49:41,485
You filthy half-blood!

1188
01:49:41,485 --> 01:49:44,079
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1189
01:49:46,023 --> 01:49:51,662
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1190
01:49:51,662 --> 01:49:54,392
Which is lucky for you, really.

1191
01:49:58,169 --> 01:50:00,103
Haven't you always wondered...

1192
01:50:00,604 --> 01:50:05,803
...what was the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1193
01:50:06,544 --> 01:50:09,213
Why he was unable to kill you...

1194
01:50:09,213 --> 01:50:11,738
...when you were just an infant?

1195
01:50:13,117 --> 01:50:17,918
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1196
01:50:18,856 --> 01:50:23,259
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1197
01:50:24,462 --> 01:50:26,453
All you have to do...

1198
01:50:27,031 --> 01:50:29,266
...is give it to me.

1199
01:50:29,266 --> 01:50:32,565
Then I can show you everything.

1200
01:50:41,312 --> 01:50:43,109
I've waited 1 4 years.

1201
01:50:43,714 --> 01:50:45,011
I know.

1202
01:50:46,317 --> 01:50:49,420
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.

1203
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:50,853
Stupefy.

1204
01:51:07,004 --> 01:51:07,993
Levicorpus.

1205
01:51:14,545 --> 01:51:16,747
Petrificus Totalus.

1206
01:51:16,747 --> 01:51:18,544
Well done, Neville.

1207
01:51:26,991 --> 01:51:28,549
Stupefy.

1208
01:51:30,294 --> 01:51:31,522
-Stupefy.
-Stupefy.

1209
01:51:42,673 --> 01:51:44,573
Stupefy.

1210
01:51:52,116 --> 01:51:54,414
Reducto.

1211
01:52:10,434 --> 01:52:12,527
Get back to the door.

1212
01:52:47,838 --> 01:52:52,332
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1213
01:52:57,548 --> 01:52:59,448
The voices.

1214
01:53:00,017 --> 01:53:02,042
Can you tell what they're saying?

1215
01:53:03,721 --> 01:53:05,882
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1216
01:53:06,624 --> 01:53:08,559
Let's get out of here.

1217
01:53:08,559 --> 01:53:10,151
I hear them too.

1218
01:53:13,264 --> 01:53:15,892
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1219
01:53:18,669 --> 01:53:20,068
Please, Harry.

1220
01:53:20,838 --> 01:53:22,703
Get behind me.

1221
01:54:09,253 --> 01:54:12,122
Did you actually believe...

1222
01:54:12,122 --> 01:54:16,718
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1223
01:54:17,328 --> 01:54:22,459
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1224
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:29,701
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1225
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:36,914
Give me the prophecy now...

1226
01:54:36,914 --> 01:54:40,907
...or watch your friends die.

1227
01:54:53,831 --> 01:54:55,230
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1228
01:55:21,525 --> 01:55:24,289
Get away from my godson.

1229
01:55:54,391 --> 01:55:57,328
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1230
01:55:57,328 --> 01:55:59,330
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1231
01:55:59,330 --> 01:56:02,163
You've done beautifully.

1232
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,635
Now, let me take it from here.

1233
01:56:04,635 --> 01:56:05,624
Black.

1234
01:56:32,796 --> 01:56:34,298
Expelliarmus!

1235
01:56:34,298 --> 01:56:35,629
Nice one, James.

1236
01:56:42,873 --> 01:56:44,340
Avada Kedavra.

1237
01:57:04,561 --> 01:57:06,859
No. No.

1238
01:57:30,821 --> 01:57:33,483
I killed Sirius Black.

1239
01:57:34,458 --> 01:57:36,426
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1240
01:57:48,772 --> 01:57:52,075
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1241
01:57:52,075 --> 01:57:55,841
She killed him. She deserves it.

1242
01:57:59,683 --> 01:58:02,880
You know the spell, Harry.

1243
01:58:14,431 --> 01:58:16,058
Do it.

1244
01:58:23,740 --> 01:58:26,709
So weak.

1245
01:58:33,484 --> 01:58:36,854
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, T om.

1246
01:58:36,854 --> 01:58:38,755
The Aurors are on their way.

1247
01:58:38,755 --> 01:58:42,953
By which time I shall be gone, and you...

1248
01:58:44,495 --> 01:58:46,588
...shall be dead.

1249
02:01:00,897 --> 02:01:02,797
You've lost, old man.

1250
02:01:22,953 --> 02:01:23,942
Harry.

1251
02:01:28,091 --> 02:01:29,581
So weak.

1252
02:01:30,093 --> 02:01:32,323
So vulnerable.

1253
02:01:36,633 --> 02:01:37,622
Look at me.

1254
02:01:40,170 --> 02:01:44,574
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1255
02:01:44,574 --> 02:01:47,065
It's how you are not.

1256
02:01:52,015 --> 02:01:53,505
Harry?

1257
02:02:25,916 --> 02:02:27,383
You're the weak one...

1258
02:02:27,984 --> 02:02:32,114
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1259
02:02:35,525 --> 02:02:38,426
And I feel sorry for you.

1260
02:03:01,485 --> 02:03:04,943
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1261
02:03:05,889 --> 02:03:11,020
And you will lose everything.

1262
02:03:25,976 --> 02:03:27,637
He's back.

1263
02:04:35,378 --> 02:04:37,214
I know how you feel, Harry.

1264
02:04:37,214 --> 02:04:38,806
No, you don't.

1265
02:04:44,454 --> 02:04:46,022
It's my fault.

1266
02:04:46,022 --> 02:04:49,287
No, the fault is mine.

1267
02:04:50,293 --> 02:04:52,229
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1268
02:04:52,229 --> 02:04:55,289
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.

1269
02:04:56,099 --> 02:05:00,537
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...

1270
02:05:00,537 --> 02:05:05,770
...he'd be less tempted,
and therefore you might be more protected.

1271
02:05:08,578 --> 02:05:11,911
The prophecy said:

1272
02:05:12,515 --> 02:05:16,474
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."

1273
02:05:17,821 --> 02:05:23,885
It means one of us
is gonna have to kill the other, in the end.

1274
02:05:25,896 --> 02:05:27,931
Yes.

1275
02:05:27,931 --> 02:05:29,666
Why didn't you tell me?

1276
02:05:29,666 --> 02:05:33,436
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1277
02:05:33,436 --> 02:05:35,870
The same reason your friends saved you.

1278
02:05:36,706 --> 02:05:40,410
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1279
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:43,311
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1280
02:05:44,781 --> 02:05:46,908
I cared too much about you.

1281
02:06:11,775 --> 02:06:14,244
How come you're not at the feast?

1282
02:06:14,244 --> 02:06:18,982
Lost all my possessions.
Apparently people have been hiding them.

1283
02:06:18,982 --> 02:06:20,150
That's awful.

1284
02:06:20,150 --> 02:06:22,218
Oh, it's all good fun.

1285
02:06:22,218 --> 02:06:25,855
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1286
02:06:25,855 --> 02:06:28,221
Do you want any help finding them?

1287
02:06:31,127 --> 02:06:34,324
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1288
02:06:41,371 --> 02:06:43,606
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1289
02:06:43,606 --> 02:06:45,442
That's all right.

1290
02:06:45,442 --> 02:06:47,777
Anyway, my mum always said...

1291
02:06:47,777 --> 02:06:51,645
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1292
02:06:54,884 --> 02:06:58,149
If not always in the way we expect.

1293
02:06:59,656 --> 02:07:02,352
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1294
02:07:38,028 --> 02:07:41,097
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1295
02:07:41,097 --> 02:07:42,792
What's that?

1296
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:46,336
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1297
02:07:46,336 --> 02:07:49,606
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1298
02:07:49,606 --> 02:07:51,096
Yeah?

1299
02:07:53,009 --> 02:07:55,375
Something worth fighting for.
