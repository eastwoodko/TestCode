1
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:52,981
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:36,863 --> 00:02:40,699
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,245
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:50,246
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:53,295
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:54,713
I only meant...

7
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:57,841
perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:00,385
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:04,097
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:07,225
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:11,063
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:14,274
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:19,275
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:31,917
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:35,754
is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:40,755
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,260
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

18
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:50,352
Harry.

19
00:03:50,353 --> 00:03:53,313
Harry!

20
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:55,816
Are you all right?

21
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:58,110
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:58,111 --> 00:04:01,613
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:03,031
Last night.

24
00:04:03,032 --> 00:04:05,450
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:05,451 --> 00:04:06,868
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:09,121
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:11,039
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,344
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:27,806
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:31,893
Keep up!

32
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,895
Arthur!

33
00:04:33,896 --> 00:04:36,064
It's about time, son.

34
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:40,610
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:45,611
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:46,492 --> 00:04:49,161
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:49,162 --> 00:04:50,495
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:53,874
This way.

39
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:57,419
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,338
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:04,760
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:09,681
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:11,683
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:13,018
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:18,019
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,692
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:20,693 --> 00:05:23,361
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:23,362 --> 00:05:24,863
Time to go!

49
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,656
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:30,869
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harwl

51
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,482
threel.

52
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,299
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,300
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,567
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:02,568 --> 00:06:07,568
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:10,868 --> 00:06:13,245
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:13,246 --> 00:06:18,246
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:24,923
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:27,092
Look!

60
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:32,093
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,853
Blimey!

62
00:06:37,854 --> 00:06:39,896
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:41,439
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,941
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:47,942
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,118
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:53,619
What?

68
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:04,129
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,630
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:08,717
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:11,303
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:11,304 --> 00:07:13,972
- Yeah, get out of the Kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:17,475
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:22,476
I love magic.

75
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,663
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:42,000
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,668
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,545
If it rains...

79
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:48,673
you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:51,217
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:54,679
by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,015
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:07:57,016 --> 00:08:01,603
There's no need with these people.

84
00:08:01,604 --> 00:08:04,522
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:04,523 --> 00:08:09,523
While you can.

86
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:24,584
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:24,585 --> 00:08:28,713
Come on!

88
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:30,840
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:35,841
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,349
<i>Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!</i>

91
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:50,481
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,866
Who's that?

93
00:08:56,867 --> 00:09:01,867
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:06,956
<i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i>

95
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,631
Krum!

96
00:09:11,632 --> 00:09:12,132
Yes!

97
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,560
Good evening!

98
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:26,771
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:30,442
it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:34,362
to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:39,363
to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,620
Let the match...

103
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:43,233
beginy.

104
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:55,337
<i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i>

105
00:10:00,347 --> 00:10:02,182
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,975
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:07,187
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:10,273
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:11,816
He's an artist.

110
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:14,277
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:15,820
<i>Viktor, I love you.</i>

112
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:17,614
<i>Viktor, I do.</i>

113
00:10:17,615 --> 00:10:20,992
<i>When we're apart
My hean* beats only for you.</i>

114
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,828
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:26,122
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:28,833
It's not the Irish.

117
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:33,129
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,673
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:39,177
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:42,388
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,349
Go!

122
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:44,850
Harry!

123
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,410
'Keep UR you lot!
- Harwl

124
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:09,411
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:59,211
<i>Morsmordre!</i>

126
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:25,450
Harry!

127
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:29,913
- Where are you?
- Harwl.

128
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:33,625
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,294
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:41,295
What is that?

131
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:43,635
<i>Stupefy!</i>

132
00:12:43,636 --> 00:12:45,136
Stop!

133
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:48,389
That's my son!

134
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,226
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:52,685
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:52,686 --> 00:12:55,021
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,190
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:59,400
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:01,069
What Crime?

140
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,738
It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.

141
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,074
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:10,119
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,538
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:15,166
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:19,671
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:13:19,672 --> 00:13:21,172
There!

147
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:24,217
All of you, this way!

148
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:25,969
A man, Harry?

149
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,845
Who?

150
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:31,266
I don't know.

151
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:36,267
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:53,830
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:58,831
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:02,797
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:14:02,798 --> 00:14:05,174
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:08,428
and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:10,680
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

158
00:14:10,681 --> 00:14:15,681
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:20,936
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,987
Thank you.

161
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:29,032
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:32,243
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:34,454
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:36,873
This is horrible.

165
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:39,792
How Can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:39,793 --> 00:14:41,711
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,672
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:14:44,673 --> 00:14:49,673
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:54,849
It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.

170
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,561
I'm fine.

171
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:01,606
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:06,607
what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:15:14,036 --> 00:15:19,036
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:56,412 --> 00:16:01,412
Clear the runway!

175
00:16:04,128 --> 00:16:09,128
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:16:30,863 --> 00:16:35,863
<i>Well, now we 're all sett/ed in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.</i>

177
00:16:36,785 --> 00:16:40,371
This Castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:16:40,372 --> 00:16:43,875
but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:47,462
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

180
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:49,172
Yes, what is it?

181
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:52,884
What is it?

182
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:56,387
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:56,388 --> 00:17:01,388
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,104
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:07,356
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

186
00:17:07,357 --> 00:17:10,693
The Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:17:10,694 --> 00:17:12,987
for a series of magical contests.

188
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:16,699
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,576
Now let me be clear.

190
00:17:18,577 --> 00:17:21,662
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,748
And trust me when I say...

192
00:17:23,749 --> 00:17:27,043
these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:31,547
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:35,760
the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:40,761
and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:57,277
Bloody hell.

197
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:06,703
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:28,312
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:18:28,313 --> 00:18:31,315
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:18:31,316 --> 00:18:36,316
and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:57,175 --> 00:18:58,926
Oh, it's Krum!

202
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:00,553
Blimey, it's him!

203
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:05,554
Viktor Krum!

204
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:12,940
Albus.

205
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:13,441
Igor.

206
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,126
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,837
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

208
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:38,549
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,302
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:46,303
they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:54,853
You idiot!

212
00:19:56,568 --> 00:20:00,905
Your attention, please!

213
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:04,825
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:07,328
Eternal glory.

215
00:20:07,329 --> 00:20:11,540
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:15,920
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:20,299
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,467
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

219
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:25,888
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:27,431
To explain all this...

221
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:31,227
we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

222
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:36,228
Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:20:47,786 --> 00:20:51,288
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:54,667
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

225
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:58,838
Dark-Wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:03,839
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

227
00:21:13,729 --> 00:21:17,648
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

228
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:22,649
Thank you.

229
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:27,575
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

230
00:21:27,576 --> 00:21:32,576
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:39,670
After due consideration...

232
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:42,715
the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

233
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:45,843
no student under the age of 17...

234
00:21:45,844 --> 00:21:49,764
shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:52,641
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

236
00:21:52,642 --> 00:21:55,394
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

237
00:21:55,395 --> 00:22:00,395
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

238
00:22:18,543 --> 00:22:21,545
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:22:21,546 --> 00:22:24,590
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:27,676
need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:22:27,677 --> 00:22:31,889
and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,475
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:38,229
If chosen, there's no turning back.

244
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,230
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:13,347
Alastor Moody.

246
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:16,684
Ex-Auror...

247
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:19,311
Ministry malcontent...

248
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:21,897
and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:26,527
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

250
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:31,448
Any questions?

251
00:23:31,449 --> 00:23:34,577
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:37,413
I believe in a practical approach.

253
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:42,414
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:23:43,628 --> 00:23:46,130
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

255
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:49,550
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

256
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:53,846
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

257
00:23:53,847 --> 00:23:56,765
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:23:56,766 --> 00:24:00,394
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

259
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:02,730
You need to be prepared.

260
00:24:02,731 --> 00:24:05,357
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:07,818
besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:11,530
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:24:11,531 --> 00:24:15,659
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,330
So which Curse shall we see first?

265
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:20,706
Wes?

266
00:24:20,707 --> 00:24:21,207
Stand.

267
00:24:25,211 --> 00:24:27,171
Give us a Curse.

268
00:24:27,172 --> 00:24:31,592
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:24:31,593 --> 00:24:33,010
The lmperius Curse.

270
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:36,722
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

271
00:24:36,723 --> 00:24:39,850
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:44,851
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:52,947
Hello.

274
00:24:52,948 --> 00:24:57,785
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:24:57,786 --> 00:25:00,162
<i>Engorgio.</i>

276
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:00,707
<i>Imperial.</i>

277
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:11,211
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

278
00:25:14,844 --> 00:25:17,054
If she bites...

279
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:21,058
She's lethal.

280
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,228
What are you laughing at?

281
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:28,065
Get off!

282
00:25:28,066 --> 00:25:30,025
Talented, isn't she?

283
00:25:30,026 --> 00:25:35,026
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:25:35,407 --> 00:25:40,407
Drown herself?

285
00:25:48,586 --> 00:25:52,006
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:25:52,007 --> 00:25:56,176
that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

287
00:25:56,177 --> 00:25:58,595
under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.

288
00:25:58,596 --> 00:26:00,848
But here's the rub:

289
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:05,849
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:26:06,187 --> 00:26:08,897
Another, another.

291
00:26:08,898 --> 00:26:10,607
Up, up. Come on.

292
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:12,818
Longbottom, is it?

293
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:16,363
Up.

294
00:26:16,364 --> 00:26:21,364
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,996
There's the...

296
00:26:23,997 --> 00:26:26,123
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:26:26,124 --> 00:26:29,168
Correct, correct. Come, come.

298
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,839
Particularly nasty.

299
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,675
The torture Curse.

300
00:26:36,676 --> 00:26:37,176
<i>Crucio!</i>

301
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:56,566
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:27:13,004 --> 00:27:18,004
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

303
00:27:19,427 --> 00:27:21,970
No?

304
00:27:21,971 --> 00:27:26,971
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

305
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:30,521
The Killing Curse.

306
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:34,233
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:27:34,234 --> 00:27:39,234
and he's sitting in this room.

308
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:10,144
Brilliant, isn't he?

309
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:14,356
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:17,693
but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

311
00:28:17,694 --> 00:28:20,445
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:28:20,446 --> 00:28:25,446
To perform them in a classroom...
l mean, did you see Neville's face?

313
00:28:27,495 --> 00:28:29,121
Nevme?

314
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:30,914
Son?

315
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:33,542
You all right?

316
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:38,543
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:56,436
We're gonna be late!

318
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:12,035
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:27,638
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

320
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:30,474
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:29:30,475 --> 00:29:32,267
Yeah, rather you than me.

322
00:29:32,268 --> 00:29:32,768
Yes!

323
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:38,482
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:29:38,483 --> 00:29:41,693
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:45,072
It's not going to work.

326
00:29:45,073 --> 00:29:47,741
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

327
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:50,869
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,829
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,874
So?

330
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:59,670
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:02,839
by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,840
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:30:08,846 --> 00:30:11,014
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

334
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:16,015
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

335
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,022
'Yesl 'Yesl.

336
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:21,692
Yeah!

337
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:23,735
Yes!

338
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:24,236
Ready?

339
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:33,533
'Yesl 'Yesl.

340
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:42,170
- You said!
- You said!

341
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:45,757
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

342
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:48,427
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

343
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:53,428
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

344
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,893
We're "old school," right?

345
00:30:56,894 --> 00:31:01,894
Yeah, but you look older!

346
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:35,636
Sit down. Please.

347
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:39,770
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:31:39,771 --> 00:31:44,771
The champion selection.

349
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:18,304
The Durmstrang Champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:32:33,074 --> 00:32:35,659
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,660
is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:32:48,214 --> 00:32:53,214
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

353
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:05,856
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:10,193
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

355
00:33:10,194 --> 00:33:13,864
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:17,033
this vessel of Victory...

357
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:22,034
the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:53,778
Harry Potter.

359
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:58,779
Harry Potter?

360
00:33:59,785 --> 00:34:02,496
No. No.

361
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:04,247
Harry Potter!

362
00:34:04,248 --> 00:34:05,916
Go on, Harry.

363
00:34:05,917 --> 00:34:10,917
Harry, for goodness sake.

364
00:34:39,158 --> 00:34:40,909
He's a cheat!

365
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:45,910
He's not even 17 yet!

366
00:35:11,315 --> 00:35:14,985
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

367
00:35:14,986 --> 00:35:18,154
- Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
- Quietl I can't think!

368
00:35:18,155 --> 00:35:20,323
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

369
00:35:20,324 --> 00:35:21,658
- Harm.
- I protest!

370
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:23,702
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:35:23,703 --> 00:35:26,037
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:27,539
- ...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

373
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,875
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

374
00:35:30,876 --> 00:35:33,336
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

375
00:35:33,337 --> 00:35:35,839
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,175
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

377
00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:41,344
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:35:41,345 --> 00:35:44,514
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

379
00:35:44,515 --> 00:35:47,851
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

380
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:52,689
- ...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

381
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,359
Leave this to you, Barty.

382
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,779
The rules are absolute.

383
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,780
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:36:05,036 --> 00:36:08,038
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,208
He is, as of tonight...

386
00:36:12,209 --> 00:36:17,209
a Triwizard champion.

387
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:44,616
This can't go on, Albus.

388
00:36:44,617 --> 00:36:47,619
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,789
What do you Suggest, Minerva?

390
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,333
Put an end to it.

391
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:55,502
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:58,129
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,132
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:03,760
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:37:03,761 --> 00:37:07,931
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:37:07,932 --> 00:37:12,018
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:37:12,019 --> 00:37:16,523
perhaps we should,
for the time being...

398
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:18,942
let them unfold.

399
00:37:18,943 --> 00:37:21,277
What...? Do nothing?

400
00:37:21,278 --> 00:37:23,947
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:37:23,948 --> 00:37:27,659
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

402
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,954
I agree. With Severus.

403
00:37:30,955 --> 00:37:34,082
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

404
00:37:34,083 --> 00:37:36,793
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

405
00:37:36,794 --> 00:37:40,463
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:43,466
knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:48,467
Then again, we all are.

408
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:04,195
How did you do it?

409
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:08,992
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.

410
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:12,495
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

411
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:15,331
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

412
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:17,125
Okay?

413
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:19,794
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

414
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:24,795
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

415
00:38:27,011 --> 00:38:29,429
I didn't put my name in that cup.

416
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:34,430
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

417
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:39,689
Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

418
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,775
It just did.

419
00:38:41,776 --> 00:38:42,276
Okay?

420
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:52,773
Piss off.

421
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:12,722
What a charismatic quartet.

422
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:15,225
Hello.

423
00:39:15,226 --> 00:39:18,353
I'm Rita Skeeter.

424
00:39:18,354 --> 00:39:21,439
<i>I write for the Daily Prophet.</i>

425
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,440
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

426
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:28,696
You're the juicy news.

427
00:39:28,697 --> 00:39:33,076
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

428
00:39:33,077 --> 00:39:36,746
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

429
00:39:36,747 --> 00:39:40,124
Does Courage lie beneath those Curls?

430
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:43,670
In short, what makes a champion tick?

431
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:48,132
"Me, Myself & I" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

432
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:53,133
So Who's feeling up to sharing?

433
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:58,931
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

434
00:40:08,821 --> 00:40:11,197
This is cozy.

435
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:13,283
It's a broom cupboard.

436
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:15,785
You should feel right at home, then.

437
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:18,705
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

438
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:20,623
No.

439
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:22,792
So tell me, Harry.

440
00:40:22,793 --> 00:40:25,879
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

441
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,547
I'm 14. Sorry.

442
00:40:27,548 --> 00:40:30,675
About to compete
against three students...

443
00:40:30,676 --> 00:40:34,137
not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

444
00:40:34,138 --> 00:40:36,890
but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

445
00:40:36,891 --> 00:40:39,726
in your dizziest daydreams.

446
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:42,937
Concerned?

447
00:40:42,938 --> 00:40:45,940
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

448
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:48,276
Just ignore the quill.

449
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:50,987
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

450
00:40:50,988 --> 00:40:54,324
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

451
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:56,659
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

452
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,079
that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

453
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,998
No, I didn't enter.

454
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:05,877
Of course you didn't.

455
00:41:05,878 --> 00:41:09,839
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

456
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,133
Scratch that last.

457
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:16,471
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

458
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:18,431
Proud? Or concerned...

459
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:22,435
that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

460
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:26,022
at worst, a psychotic death wish?

461
00:41:26,023 --> 00:41:31,023
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

462
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:05,895
<i>Harry, I cou/dn 't risk sending Hedwig.</i>

463
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:09,357
<i>Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more ow/s...</i>

464
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:11,734
<i>and she's too easily recognized.</i>

465
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:14,779
<i>We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.</i>

466
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:19,117
<i>Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.</i>

467
00:42:19,118 --> 00:42:21,077
<i>And make sure you're alone.</i>

468
00:42:21,078 --> 00:42:22,745
<i>Sirius.</i>

469
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:24,414
P. S. .'

470
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:29,415
<i>The bird bites.</i>

471
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:37,052
Sirius?

472
00:42:54,862 --> 00:42:56,946
<i>Harry Potter, age 12...</i>

473
00:42:56,947 --> 00:43:00,074
<i>suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.</i>

474
00:43:00,075 --> 00:43:02,827
<i>His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...</i>

475
00:43:02,828 --> 00:43:07,828
<i>and choking back tears...</i>

476
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:22,638
Sirius. How...?

477
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:25,308
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

478
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:28,436
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

479
00:43:28,437 --> 00:43:30,480
No!

480
00:43:30,481 --> 00:43:31,939
I had to ask.

481
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:36,903
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

482
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:39,489
But who was the third man in the room?

483
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,825
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

484
00:43:42,826 --> 00:43:45,286
No.

485
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:49,165
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

486
00:43:49,166 --> 00:43:52,668
And what was that?

487
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:54,462
He wanted...

488
00:43:54,463 --> 00:43:56,672
me.

489
00:43:56,673 --> 00:44:01,673
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

490
00:44:02,304 --> 00:44:04,847
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

491
00:44:04,848 --> 00:44:06,641
Yes.

492
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:08,935
It's just a dream.

493
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:10,520
Look, Harry.

494
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:14,190
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

495
00:44:14,191 --> 00:44:18,361
these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

496
00:44:18,362 --> 00:44:19,612
What are you saying?

497
00:44:19,613 --> 00:44:24,033
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

498
00:44:24,034 --> 00:44:28,871
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

499
00:44:28,872 --> 00:44:33,872
Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

500
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:41,092
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

501
00:44:41,093 --> 00:44:43,553
I haven't a Clue who put your name
in that goblet...

502
00:44:43,554 --> 00:44:47,723
but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

503
00:44:47,724 --> 00:44:52,724
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

504
00:44:54,731 --> 00:44:59,731
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

505
00:45:00,445 --> 00:45:01,946
Who were you talking to?

506
00:45:01,947 --> 00:45:05,283
- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard Voices.

507
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:09,829
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

508
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:14,830
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

509
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:42,695
Amazing.

510
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:46,949
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

511
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,243
Right, sorry.

512
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:52,413
<i>"Magical Water Plants
of the High/and Lochs"?</i>

513
00:45:52,414 --> 00:45:57,084
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

514
00:45:57,085 --> 00:45:58,961
It's already been through enough people.

515
00:45:58,962 --> 00:46:02,548
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

516
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:05,051
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

517
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:07,303
What do you want me to say again?

518
00:46:07,304 --> 00:46:07,804
Go.

519
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:16,312
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

520
00:46:16,313 --> 00:46:20,107
that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

521
00:46:20,108 --> 00:46:22,693
Is that right? Well, you...

522
00:46:22,694 --> 00:46:23,194
What?

523
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:33,867
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

524
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:38,834
Dean was told by Parvati that...

525
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:41,420
Please don't ask me to say it again.

526
00:46:41,421 --> 00:46:43,381
Hagrid's looking for you.

527
00:46:43,382 --> 00:46:48,382
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

528
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,438
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

529
00:46:59,439 --> 00:47:02,191
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

530
00:47:02,192 --> 00:47:03,776
You'll see soon enough.

531
00:47:03,777 --> 00:47:07,697
Now pay attention, this is important.

532
00:47:07,698 --> 00:47:10,199
What's with the flower?

533
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,035
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

534
00:47:13,036 --> 00:47:15,204
As a matter of fact, I have.

535
00:47:15,205 --> 00:47:20,205
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

536
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:27,133
Hagñd?

537
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:37,014
The cloak! Put the Cloak on!

538
00:47:40,439 --> 00:47:44,025
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

539
00:47:44,026 --> 00:47:47,903
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

540
00:47:47,904 --> 00:47:50,740
you had forgotten me.

541
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:53,367
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

542
00:47:53,368 --> 00:47:56,871
What is it you wanted to show me?

543
00:47:56,872 --> 00:48:00,416
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

544
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:02,501
exhilarated.

545
00:48:02,502 --> 00:48:07,502
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

546
00:48:15,932 --> 00:48:20,932
Can we get closer?

547
00:48:25,484 --> 00:48:27,109
Dragons?

548
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,028
That's the first task?

549
00:48:29,029 --> 00:48:32,323
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

550
00:48:32,324 --> 00:48:36,452
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

551
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:38,454
Oh, crikey!

552
00:48:38,455 --> 00:48:43,455
Although, I have to admit, that Horntail
is a right nasty piece of work.

553
00:48:43,752 --> 00:48:48,089
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

554
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:50,299
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

555
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,969
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

556
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:57,348
Didn't Ron tell you that?

557
00:48:57,349 --> 00:48:59,475
No, he didn't.

558
00:48:59,476 --> 00:49:04,476
He didn't tell me a thing.

559
00:49:11,321 --> 00:49:15,908
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

560
00:49:15,909 --> 00:49:18,744
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

561
00:49:18,745 --> 00:49:22,498
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

562
00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:24,708
Like the badge?

563
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:29,709
Excuse me.

564
00:49:30,632 --> 00:49:32,675
Harry.

565
00:49:32,676 --> 00:49:34,802
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

566
00:49:34,803 --> 00:49:37,263
Can I have a word?

567
00:49:37,264 --> 00:49:39,306
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

568
00:49:39,307 --> 00:49:44,307
- Potter, you stink!
- Harw Potter smells!

569
00:49:44,813 --> 00:49:47,523
Dragons. That's the first task.

570
00:49:47,524 --> 00:49:50,860
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

571
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:53,654
Are you serious?

572
00:49:53,655 --> 00:49:56,866
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

573
00:49:56,867 --> 00:49:59,285
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

574
00:49:59,286 --> 00:50:00,911
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

575
00:50:00,912 --> 00:50:03,581
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

576
00:50:03,582 --> 00:50:06,792
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

577
00:50:06,793 --> 00:50:09,920
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

578
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:11,547
It just happens a fair bit.

579
00:50:11,548 --> 00:50:14,800
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

580
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:16,802
You're a right foul git, you know that?

581
00:50:16,803 --> 00:50:19,221
- You think so?
- I know so.

582
00:50:19,222 --> 00:50:20,723
Anything else?

583
00:50:20,724 --> 00:50:25,724
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

584
00:50:26,605 --> 00:50:30,983
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

585
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:33,569
My father and I have a bet, you see.

586
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:38,570
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

587
00:50:39,326 --> 00:50:42,411
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

588
00:50:42,412 --> 00:50:46,540
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

589
00:50:46,541 --> 00:50:51,420
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

590
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:56,217
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

591
00:50:56,218 --> 00:50:59,261
I'll teach you to Curse someone
when their back is turned!

592
00:50:59,262 --> 00:51:03,265
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

593
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:05,184
- Professor Moody!
- ...back-shooting...

594
00:51:05,185 --> 00:51:09,104
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

595
00:51:09,105 --> 00:51:14,105
- Is that a...? Ls that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

596
00:51:18,907 --> 00:51:23,907
Stand Still! Stand Still!

597
00:51:31,795 --> 00:51:34,171
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

598
00:51:34,172 --> 00:51:36,298
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

599
00:51:36,299 --> 00:51:38,300
Professor!

600
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:42,054
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

601
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:44,932
- Alastorl Alastor.
- Lt doesn't end here!

602
00:51:44,933 --> 00:51:48,894
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

603
00:51:48,895 --> 00:51:51,647
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

604
00:51:51,648 --> 00:51:56,648
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

605
00:51:57,195 --> 00:51:57,695
Away!

606
00:52:01,783 --> 00:52:06,783
You. Come with me.

607
00:52:39,195 --> 00:52:42,031
That's a Foe-Glass.

608
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:44,575
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

609
00:52:44,576 --> 00:52:49,576
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

610
00:52:53,168 --> 00:52:55,794
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

611
00:52:55,795 --> 00:52:58,088
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

612
00:52:58,089 --> 00:53:01,467
Now...

613
00:53:01,468 --> 00:53:06,468
what are you going to do
about your dragon?

614
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:11,977
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

615
00:53:11,978 --> 00:53:12,478
Sit.

616
00:53:17,192 --> 00:53:19,568
Listen to me, Potter.

617
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:20,903
Your pal Diggory?

618
00:53:20,904 --> 00:53:25,904
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

619
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:28,202
Miss Delacour?

620
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:31,413
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

621
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:35,167
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

622
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,503
but Karkaroff's is not.

623
00:53:37,504 --> 00:53:39,505
They'll have a strategy.

624
00:53:39,506 --> 00:53:44,506
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

625
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:49,556
Come on, Potter.

626
00:53:49,557 --> 00:53:53,227
What are your strengths?

627
00:53:53,228 --> 00:53:54,770
I don't know.

628
00:53:54,771 --> 00:53:57,731
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

629
00:53:57,732 --> 00:54:01,944
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

630
00:54:01,945 --> 00:54:06,945
You're allowed a wand.

631
00:54:11,996 --> 00:54:13,622
Bets! Place your bets!

632
00:54:13,623 --> 00:54:15,958
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

633
00:54:15,959 --> 00:54:19,086
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

634
00:54:19,087 --> 00:54:22,131
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

635
00:54:22,132 --> 00:54:23,966
Yes, sir?

636
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:27,177
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

637
00:54:27,178 --> 00:54:29,346
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

638
00:54:29,347 --> 00:54:34,347
<i>This is a great day for all of us.</i>

639
00:54:35,395 --> 00:54:39,815
<i>Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.</i>

640
00:54:39,816 --> 00:54:42,651
<i>Please keep your seats at all times.</i>

641
00:54:42,652 --> 00:54:45,571
<i>This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.</i>

642
00:54:45,572 --> 00:54:49,158
- Harw? Is that you?
- Yeah.

643
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:51,034
<i>I'm sure we all wish our champions...</i>

644
00:54:51,035 --> 00:54:56,035
- How are you feeling? Okay?
- ...the greatest of <i>luck.</i>

645
00:54:56,416 --> 00:55:00,002
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

646
00:55:00,003 --> 00:55:05,003
Battle a dragon.

647
00:55:06,134 --> 00:55:09,344
Young love.

648
00:55:09,345 --> 00:55:13,056
How...

649
00:55:13,057 --> 00:55:17,019
stirring.

650
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,355
If everything goes Unfortunately today...

651
00:55:20,356 --> 00:55:23,317
you two may even
make the front page.

652
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:25,694
You have no business here.

653
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:28,071
This tent is for champions...

654
00:55:28,072 --> 00:55:32,576
and friends.

655
00:55:32,577 --> 00:55:37,577
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

656
00:55:39,876 --> 00:55:42,878
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

657
00:55:42,879 --> 00:55:47,216
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

658
00:55:47,217 --> 00:55:50,636
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

659
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:54,056
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

660
00:55:54,057 --> 00:55:55,891
Sorry, I'll just go.

661
00:55:55,892 --> 00:55:57,893
Barty, the bag.

662
00:55:57,894 --> 00:56:00,270
Champions, in a Circle around me.

663
00:56:00,271 --> 00:56:03,565
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

664
00:56:03,566 --> 00:56:07,653
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

665
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:12,654
Miss Delacour, if you will.

666
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,160
The Welsh Green.

667
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:24,753
Mr. Krum.

668
00:56:24,754 --> 00:56:29,754
The Chinese Fireball.

669
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:36,014
The Swedish Short-Snout.

670
00:56:36,015 --> 00:56:38,183
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

671
00:56:38,184 --> 00:56:43,184
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

672
00:56:43,857 --> 00:56:48,443
The Hungarian Horntail.

673
00:56:48,444 --> 00:56:51,738
These represent four
very real dragons...

674
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:54,950
each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

675
00:56:54,951 --> 00:56:57,619
Your objective is simple:

676
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,288
Collect the egg.

677
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:02,457
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

678
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:06,128
without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

679
00:57:06,129 --> 00:57:08,463
Any questions?

680
00:57:08,464 --> 00:57:11,300
Very well. Good luck, champions.

681
00:57:11,301 --> 00:57:16,301
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the Cannon,
you may...

682
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:27,770
<i>Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!</i>

683
00:57:38,161 --> 00:57:41,705
<i>Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...</i>

684
00:57:41,706 --> 00:57:45,792
<i>and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.</i>

685
00:57:45,793 --> 00:57:50,793
<i>And now our fourth and final contestant.</i>

686
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:55,840
<i>Harry! Harry! Harry!</i>

687
00:59:01,536 --> 00:59:04,955
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

688
00:59:04,956 --> 00:59:09,956
<i>Accio Firebolt!</i>

689
00:59:35,987 --> 00:59:40,987
- Yeah!
- Yes!

690
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:52,081
Gh, my God.

691
00:59:58,134 --> 01:00:03,134
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

692
01:02:33,456 --> 01:02:34,068
Yes! Yes!

693
01:02:58,814 --> 01:03:01,691
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

694
01:03:01,692 --> 01:03:03,818
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

695
01:03:03,819 --> 01:03:07,656
- Never!
- Never!

696
01:03:07,657 --> 01:03:09,491
Shush!

697
01:03:09,492 --> 01:03:13,161
Go on, Harry. What's the Clue?

698
01:03:13,162 --> 01:03:16,831
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

699
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:21,832
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

700
01:03:30,513 --> 01:03:35,513
What the bloody hell was that?

701
01:03:37,061 --> 01:03:39,980
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

702
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:44,981
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

703
01:03:47,196 --> 01:03:51,533
I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

704
01:03:51,534 --> 01:03:55,370
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

705
01:03:55,371 --> 01:03:57,664
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

706
01:03:57,665 --> 01:04:02,127
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

707
01:04:02,128 --> 01:04:06,298
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

708
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:09,884
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

709
01:04:09,885 --> 01:04:11,511
No, no, no, I did.

710
01:04:11,512 --> 01:04:14,723
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

711
01:04:14,724 --> 01:04:18,935
that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

712
01:04:18,936 --> 01:04:23,898
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

713
01:04:23,899 --> 01:04:27,110
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

714
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:29,487
after you'd figured that out.

715
01:04:29,488 --> 01:04:32,824
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

716
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:34,409
That's completely mental.

717
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:37,620
Yeah. Isn't it?

718
01:04:37,621 --> 01:04:42,250
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

719
01:04:42,251 --> 01:04:42,751
Boys.

720
01:05:08,444 --> 01:05:13,444
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

721
01:05:13,491 --> 01:05:18,491
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

722
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,457
Shush.

723
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:25,794
Look at this!

724
01:05:25,795 --> 01:05:29,339
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

725
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:31,758
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl..."

726
01:05:31,759 --> 01:05:34,677
seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

727
01:05:34,678 --> 01:05:37,138
Her latest prey, sources report...

728
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:41,059
is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

729
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:46,060
"No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

730
01:05:46,357 --> 01:05:48,483
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

731
01:05:48,484 --> 01:05:53,484
Thank you, Nigel.

732
01:05:54,782 --> 01:05:59,452
Not now, Nigel. Later.

733
01:05:59,453 --> 01:05:59,953
Go on.

734
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:11,297
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

735
01:06:11,298 --> 01:06:16,298
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

736
01:06:21,183 --> 01:06:23,184
Mum sent me a dress.

737
01:06:23,185 --> 01:06:27,480
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

738
01:06:27,481 --> 01:06:29,858
Nose down, Harry.

739
01:06:29,859 --> 01:06:34,859
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

740
01:06:35,531 --> 01:06:37,532
What are you on about?

741
01:06:37,533 --> 01:06:39,659
They're not for Ginny.

742
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:42,036
They're for you.

743
01:06:42,037 --> 01:06:47,037
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

744
01:06:47,042 --> 01:06:49,377
The Yule Ball...

745
01:06:49,378 --> 01:06:54,378
has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

746
01:06:55,426 --> 01:06:58,178
since its inception.

747
01:06:58,179 --> 01:07:02,223
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

748
01:07:02,224 --> 01:07:04,058
gather in the Great Hall...

749
01:07:04,059 --> 01:07:09,059
for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

750
01:07:09,648 --> 01:07:12,066
As representatives of the host school...

751
01:07:12,067 --> 01:07:17,067
I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

752
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:20,283
And I mean this literally, because...

753
01:07:20,284 --> 01:07:25,284
the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

754
01:07:25,581 --> 01:07:26,125
a dance.

755
01:07:31,337 --> 01:07:33,338
Silence!

756
01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:36,508
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

757
01:07:36,509 --> 01:07:39,302
of the Wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

758
01:07:39,303 --> 01:07:43,556
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

759
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:48,478
by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

760
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:50,605
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

761
01:07:50,606 --> 01:07:52,273
Now, to dance...

762
01:07:52,274 --> 01:07:56,152
is to let the body breathe.

763
01:07:56,153 --> 01:07:59,656
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

764
01:07:59,657 --> 01:08:02,200
longing to burst forth and take flight.

765
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:06,371
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

766
01:08:06,372 --> 01:08:09,666
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

767
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:12,085
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

768
01:08:12,086 --> 01:08:17,086
Will you join me, please?

769
01:08:19,134 --> 01:08:22,804
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

770
01:08:22,805 --> 01:08:25,557
- Where?
- My waist.

771
01:08:25,558 --> 01:08:28,560
And extend your arm.

772
01:08:28,561 --> 01:08:33,561
Mr. Filch, if you please.

773
01:08:33,607 --> 01:08:35,775
One, two, three.

774
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:40,776
One, two, three. One, two, three.

775
01:08:42,992 --> 01:08:45,285
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

776
01:08:45,286 --> 01:08:46,619
- Never.
- Never.

777
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:51,620
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

778
01:09:13,564 --> 01:09:15,690
Why do they have to travel in packs?

779
01:09:15,691 --> 01:09:20,691
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

780
01:09:26,201 --> 01:09:29,871
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

781
01:09:29,872 --> 01:09:34,872
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

782
01:09:38,339 --> 01:09:40,048
I take after my mum.

783
01:09:40,049 --> 01:09:44,177
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

784
01:09:44,178 --> 01:09:46,262
No, not the maternal sort, apparently.

785
01:09:46,263 --> 01:09:50,016
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

786
01:09:50,017 --> 01:09:54,729
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

787
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:59,108
He laughed so hard at that.

788
01:09:59,109 --> 01:10:04,109
Very funny.

789
01:10:06,909 --> 01:10:10,828
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

790
01:10:10,829 --> 01:10:14,290
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

791
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:19,291
But enough of me. What about you?

792
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:38,727
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

793
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:43,986
Well, us and Neville.

794
01:10:43,987 --> 01:10:47,407
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

795
01:10:47,408 --> 01:10:52,408
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

796
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:58,205
Now I'm really depressed.

797
01:11:00,796 --> 01:11:05,796
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

798
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:11,013
Who you going with, then?

799
01:11:11,014 --> 01:11:12,890
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

800
01:11:12,891 --> 01:11:17,891
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

801
01:11:18,522 --> 01:11:20,440
To the ball?

802
01:11:20,441 --> 01:11:25,441
Yeah, all right.

803
01:11:25,612 --> 01:11:27,321
Oi, Hermione.

804
01:11:27,322 --> 01:11:29,157
You're a girl.

805
01:11:29,158 --> 01:11:30,658
Very well spotted.

806
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:35,659
Come with one of us?

807
01:11:37,207 --> 01:11:40,293
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

808
01:11:40,294 --> 01:11:41,961
For a girl, it's just sad.

809
01:11:41,962 --> 01:11:46,962
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

810
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:56,517
And I said yes!

811
01:11:56,518 --> 01:11:58,269
Bloody hell.

812
01:11:58,270 --> 01:12:00,104
She's lying, right?

813
01:12:00,105 --> 01:12:02,023
If you say so.

814
01:12:02,024 --> 01:12:05,526
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

815
01:12:05,527 --> 01:12:09,572
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

816
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:10,073
Agreed.

817
01:12:35,516 --> 01:12:40,394
'Cho! "Ham/g."

818
01:12:40,395 --> 01:12:43,314
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

819
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:48,315
Okay, thanks.

820
01:12:49,363 --> 01:12:51,364
Cho?

821
01:12:51,365 --> 01:12:54,283
Yes?

822
01:12:54,284 --> 01:12:56,702
Well, I just wondered if you...

823
01:12:56,703 --> 01:13:01,165
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

824
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:04,335
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

825
01:13:04,336 --> 01:13:09,336
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

826
01:13:15,264 --> 01:13:17,014
Harry...

827
01:13:17,015 --> 01:13:20,852
I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

828
01:13:20,853 --> 01:13:22,937
And...

829
01:13:22,938 --> 01:13:27,859
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

830
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:31,737
Okay. Yeah. Great.

831
01:13:31,738 --> 01:13:34,782
Fine. No problem.

832
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:37,618
Okay. Good.

833
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:39,996
Harry?

834
01:13:39,997 --> 01:13:41,956
I really am...

835
01:13:41,957 --> 01:13:42,569
sorry.

836
01:13:53,385 --> 01:13:55,052
It's all right, Ron.

837
01:13:55,053 --> 01:13:58,431
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

838
01:13:58,432 --> 01:14:00,558
What happened to you?

839
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:02,894
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

840
01:14:02,895 --> 01:14:05,563
- What?
- What did she say?

841
01:14:05,564 --> 01:14:08,482
No, of course.

842
01:14:08,483 --> 01:14:12,236
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

843
01:14:12,237 --> 01:14:17,237
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

844
01:14:17,409 --> 01:14:21,203
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

845
01:14:21,204 --> 01:14:25,833
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

846
01:14:25,834 --> 01:14:29,629
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

847
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:33,507
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

848
01:14:33,508 --> 01:14:34,926
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

849
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:39,347
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

850
01:14:39,348 --> 01:14:42,516
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

851
01:14:42,517 --> 01:14:43,017
Hey!

852
01:15:00,619 --> 01:15:04,538
Bloody hell.

853
01:15:04,539 --> 01:15:09,539
Bloody hell.

854
01:15:09,836 --> 01:15:11,295
Bloody...

855
01:15:11,296 --> 01:15:16,217
Oh, bloody...

856
01:15:16,218 --> 01:15:19,095
What are those? What are those?

857
01:15:19,096 --> 01:15:22,306
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

858
01:15:22,307 --> 01:15:25,393
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

859
01:15:25,394 --> 01:15:27,520
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

860
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:32,521
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

861
01:15:34,903 --> 01:15:39,903
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

862
01:15:42,744 --> 01:15:45,955
Murder me, Harry.

863
01:15:45,956 --> 01:15:48,499
Leave it alone!

864
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:52,086
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

865
01:15:52,087 --> 01:15:54,755
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

866
01:15:54,756 --> 01:15:58,509
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

867
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:00,886
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

868
01:16:00,887 --> 01:16:05,887
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

869
01:16:06,935 --> 01:16:08,519
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

870
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,938
Don't you look...

871
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:12,690
dashing.

872
01:16:12,691 --> 01:16:16,027
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

873
01:16:16,028 --> 01:16:18,029
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

874
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:21,240
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

875
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:22,616
Are the first to dance.

876
01:16:22,617 --> 01:16:25,828
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

877
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:29,081
Well, now you know.

878
01:16:29,082 --> 01:16:33,544
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

879
01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:36,130
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

880
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:41,131
Come along this way.

881
01:16:42,471 --> 01:16:45,139
Oh, come on.

882
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:47,308
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

883
01:16:47,309 --> 01:16:52,309
in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

884
01:16:52,898 --> 01:16:56,984
This way. This way. Come along.

885
01:16:56,985 --> 01:16:59,403
She looks beautiful!

886
01:16:59,404 --> 01:17:04,404
Yeah, she does.

887
01:17:48,370 --> 01:17:52,581
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

888
01:17:52,582 --> 01:17:57,582
No. Absolutely not.

889
01:17:59,881 --> 01:18:00,381
Hi!

890
01:18:10,183 --> 01:18:13,060
Harry, take my waist.

891
01:18:13,061 --> 01:18:18,061
- What?
- Now!

892
01:19:21,046 --> 01:19:23,464
Are you ready?

893
01:19:23,465 --> 01:19:26,508
<i>Move your body like a hairy tro/I.</i>

894
01:19:26,509 --> 01:19:29,386
<i>Learning to rock and roll.</i>

895
01:19:29,387 --> 01:19:32,473
<i>Spin around like a crazy elf.</i>

896
01:19:32,474 --> 01:19:35,017
<i>Dancing by himself.</i>

897
01:19:35,018 --> 01:19:38,520
<i>Boogie down like</i> a <i>unicorn.</i>

898
01:19:38,521 --> 01:19:41,148
<i>No stopping till the break of dawn.</i>

899
01:19:41,149 --> 01:19:44,151
<i>Put your hands up in the air.</i>

900
01:19:44,152 --> 01:19:47,655
<i>Like an ogre who just don't care.</i>

901
01:19:47,656 --> 01:19:52,656
<i>Can you dance like</i> a <i>Hippogriff?</i>

902
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:56,997
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

903
01:19:56,998 --> 01:20:01,998
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

904
01:20:02,337 --> 01:20:04,046
May I have your arm?

905
01:20:04,047 --> 01:20:09,047
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

906
01:20:32,701 --> 01:20:34,952
Hot, isn't it?

907
01:20:34,953 --> 01:20:38,455
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

908
01:20:38,456 --> 01:20:43,456
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

909
01:20:43,837 --> 01:20:46,463
What's got your wand in a knot?

910
01:20:46,464 --> 01:20:50,342
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

911
01:20:50,343 --> 01:20:54,596
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

912
01:20:54,597 --> 01:20:57,224
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

913
01:20:57,225 --> 01:21:01,312
is international
magical cooperation...

914
01:21:01,313 --> 01:21:03,564
to make friends.

915
01:21:03,565 --> 01:21:08,565
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

916
01:21:16,703 --> 01:21:19,204
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

917
01:21:19,205 --> 01:21:19,705
No.

918
01:21:28,882 --> 01:21:31,467
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

919
01:21:31,468 --> 01:21:35,846
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

920
01:21:35,847 --> 01:21:39,683
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

921
01:21:39,684 --> 01:21:41,977
You know the solution then, don't you?

922
01:21:41,978 --> 01:21:44,146
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

923
01:21:44,147 --> 01:21:47,441
pluck up the Courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

924
01:21:47,442 --> 01:21:49,651
And not as a last resort.

925
01:21:49,652 --> 01:21:54,031
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

926
01:21:54,032 --> 01:21:55,824
Harry.

927
01:21:55,825 --> 01:21:57,284
Where have you been?

928
01:21:57,285 --> 01:22:02,285
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

929
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:06,794
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you Spoiled everything!

930
01:22:06,795 --> 01:22:11,795
What's this about?

931
01:22:12,967 --> 01:22:17,763
<i>No, don't let.</i>

932
01:22:17,764 --> 01:22:22,764
<i>This magic die.</i>

933
01:22:23,853 --> 01:22:28,853
<i>The answer's there.</i>

934
01:23:24,956 --> 01:23:28,375
Let me see it again.

935
01:23:28,376 --> 01:23:33,376
Yes, the time is close now.

936
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:39,136
<i>Harry, at last!</i>

937
01:23:39,137 --> 01:23:44,137
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

938
01:23:55,069 --> 01:23:57,905
You all right, Harry?

939
01:23:57,906 --> 01:24:00,282
I just got in.

940
01:24:00,283 --> 01:24:00,783
Me.

941
01:24:12,795 --> 01:24:16,256
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

942
01:24:16,257 --> 01:24:21,257
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

943
01:24:21,971 --> 01:24:23,931
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

944
01:24:23,932 --> 01:24:27,976
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

945
01:24:27,977 --> 01:24:32,977
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

946
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:39,988
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

947
01:24:39,989 --> 01:24:43,033
Mostly, he watches me study.

948
01:24:43,034 --> 01:24:46,495
It's a bit annoying, actually.

949
01:24:46,496 --> 01:24:50,040
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

950
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:52,125
What's that supposed to mean?

951
01:24:52,126 --> 01:24:55,295
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

952
01:24:55,296 --> 01:24:59,633
in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

953
01:24:59,634 --> 01:25:03,595
And...

954
01:25:03,596 --> 01:25:06,431
I'm scared for you.

955
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:09,643
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

956
01:25:09,644 --> 01:25:12,312
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

957
01:25:12,313 --> 01:25:17,313
Hey, Potter!

958
01:25:19,737 --> 01:25:23,949
- Potter!
- Cedric.

959
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:26,660
How...? How are you?

960
01:25:26,661 --> 01:25:29,621
Spectacular.

961
01:25:29,622 --> 01:25:33,625
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

962
01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:36,253
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

963
01:25:36,254 --> 01:25:38,922
Exactly.

964
01:25:38,923 --> 01:25:43,923
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

965
01:25:45,346 --> 01:25:50,309
It's not a bad place for a bath.

966
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:52,936
Just take your egg...

967
01:25:52,937 --> 01:25:57,937
and mull things over
in the hot water.

968
01:26:30,892 --> 01:26:35,892
I must be out of my mind.

969
01:26:43,237 --> 01:26:48,075
I'm definitely out of my mind.

970
01:26:48,076 --> 01:26:51,536
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

971
01:26:51,537 --> 01:26:53,580
Myrtle!

972
01:26:53,581 --> 01:26:56,083
Hello, Harry.

973
01:26:56,084 --> 01:27:01,084
Long time no see.

974
01:27:03,591 --> 01:27:07,427
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

975
01:27:07,428 --> 01:27:11,056
and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

976
01:27:11,057 --> 01:27:13,558
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

977
01:27:13,559 --> 01:27:16,103
Polyjuice Potion?

978
01:27:16,104 --> 01:27:21,104
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

979
01:27:26,948 --> 01:27:29,449
That's what he did.

980
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:32,536
The other boy...

981
01:27:32,537 --> 01:27:35,914
the handsome one...

982
01:27:35,915 --> 01:27:36,415
Cedric.

983
01:27:40,545 --> 01:27:45,545
Well, go on. Open it.

984
01:27:51,305 --> 01:27:56,305
<i>Come seek us
Where our Voices sound.</i>

985
01:27:56,477 --> 01:28:01,314
<i>We cannot sing Above the ground.</i>

986
01:28:01,315 --> 01:28:06,315
<i>An hour long you'll have to look.</i>

987
01:28:06,446 --> 01:28:11,446
<i>To recover what we took.</i>

988
01:28:19,292 --> 01:28:22,169
Myrtle...

989
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:26,506
there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

990
01:28:26,507 --> 01:28:29,050
Very good.

991
01:28:29,051 --> 01:28:33,930
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

992
01:28:33,931 --> 01:28:38,931
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

993
01:28:55,369 --> 01:28:59,039
Harry, tell me again.

994
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:02,042
"Come seek us
where our Voices sound."

995
01:29:02,043 --> 01:29:05,587
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

996
01:29:05,588 --> 01:29:08,298
"An hour long you'll have to look."

997
01:29:08,299 --> 01:29:13,136
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

998
01:29:13,137 --> 01:29:15,180
"Potentially problematic"?

999
01:29:15,181 --> 01:29:18,975
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1000
01:29:18,976 --> 01:29:23,480
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1001
01:29:23,481 --> 01:29:26,149
Hate to break up the skull session.

1002
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:28,401
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1003
01:29:28,402 --> 01:29:30,946
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1004
01:29:30,947 --> 01:29:33,782
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1005
01:29:33,783 --> 01:29:36,576
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1006
01:29:36,577 --> 01:29:38,578
and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1007
01:29:38,579 --> 01:29:39,123
Go. Now!

1008
01:29:51,092 --> 01:29:53,051
Longbottom!

1009
01:29:53,052 --> 01:29:58,052
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1010
01:30:03,729 --> 01:30:06,106
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1011
01:30:06,107 --> 01:30:09,276
you'd be better off with
Goshawk's <i>Guide</i> to Herbology.

1012
01:30:09,277 --> 01:30:13,780
Do you know there's a Wizard in Nepal
Who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1013
01:30:13,781 --> 01:30:18,118
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1014
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:20,203
about plants.

1015
01:30:20,204 --> 01:30:22,080
Now, if there's...

1016
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:27,043
a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1017
01:30:27,044 --> 01:30:29,713
then great. But otherwise...

1018
01:30:29,714 --> 01:30:34,714
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1019
01:30:34,844 --> 01:30:37,762
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1020
01:30:37,763 --> 01:30:39,389
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1021
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:40,974
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1022
01:30:40,975 --> 01:30:43,310
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1023
01:30:43,311 --> 01:30:45,478
Don't be so mean.

1024
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:49,482
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1025
01:30:49,483 --> 01:30:51,651
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1026
01:30:51,652 --> 01:30:53,737
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1027
01:30:53,738 --> 01:30:55,405
Most likely?

1028
01:30:55,406 --> 01:30:57,782
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1029
01:30:57,783 --> 01:31:00,410
as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1030
01:31:00,411 --> 01:31:03,246
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1031
01:31:03,247 --> 01:31:05,373
I just wanted to help.

1032
01:31:05,374 --> 01:31:08,668
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1033
01:31:08,669 --> 01:31:10,587
Where are they anyway?

1034
01:31:10,588 --> 01:31:15,588
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1035
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,016
<i>Welcome to the second task.</i>

1036
01:31:23,017 --> 01:31:26,895
<i>Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.</i>

1037
01:31:26,896 --> 01:31:28,438
<i>A treasure of sorts.</i>

1038
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:31,232
<i>These four treasures,
one for each champion...</i>

1039
01:31:31,233 --> 01:31:34,110
<i>now /ie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.</i>

1040
01:31:34,111 --> 01:31:35,862
<i>In order to win...</i>

1041
01:31:35,863 --> 01:31:39,866
<i>each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.</i>

1042
01:31:39,867 --> 01:31:42,661
- Simple enough, <i>except</i> for <i>this:</i>
- Put that in your mouth.

1043
01:31:42,662 --> 01:31:46,456
<i>They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.</i>

1044
01:31:46,457 --> 01:31:50,877
<i>After that, they'/I be on their own.
No magic will save them.</i>

1045
01:31:50,878 --> 01:31:55,878
<i>You may begin
at the sound of the Cannon.</i>

1046
01:32:19,657 --> 01:32:23,910
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1047
01:32:23,911 --> 01:32:28,748
Gh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1048
01:32:28,749 --> 01:32:31,835
Yeah!

1049
01:32:31,836 --> 01:32:32,336
What?

1050
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:55,335
<i>The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...</i>

1051
01:33:55,336 --> 01:33:58,505
<i>has unfortunately
been forced to retire...</i>

1052
01:33:58,506 --> 01:34:03,506
so <i>she will take no further part
in this task.</i>

1053
01:35:19,420 --> 01:35:22,839
But She's my friend too!

1054
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:23,452
Only one!

1055
01:36:15,935 --> 01:36:20,935
Let's get down below.

1056
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:32,780
<i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i>

1057
01:37:28,173 --> 01:37:28,673
Yes!

1058
01:37:48,027 --> 01:37:48,639
<i>Ascendio!</i>

1059
01:37:55,326 --> 01:37:55,826
Harry!

1060
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:01,998
He's all right.

1061
01:38:01,999 --> 01:38:03,583
He's all right. Barty!

1062
01:38:03,584 --> 01:38:07,628
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1063
01:38:07,629 --> 01:38:11,758
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1064
01:38:11,759 --> 01:38:13,885
My little sister.

1065
01:38:13,886 --> 01:38:16,262
Thank you.

1066
01:38:16,263 --> 01:38:19,599
And you! You helped.

1067
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:24,600
Well, yeah, a bit.

1068
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:31,194
- Harwl.
- Hermione!

1069
01:38:31,195 --> 01:38:35,114
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1070
01:38:35,115 --> 01:38:37,200
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1071
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:40,078
I finished last, Hermione.

1072
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:44,374
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1073
01:38:44,375 --> 01:38:47,794
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1074
01:38:47,795 --> 01:38:52,795
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1075
01:38:53,008 --> 01:38:56,094
Attention!

1076
01:38:56,095 --> 01:39:00,390
The winner is Mr. Diggow...

1077
01:39:00,391 --> 01:39:04,060
who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1078
01:39:04,061 --> 01:39:06,896
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1079
01:39:06,897 --> 01:39:11,897
had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1080
01:39:12,027 --> 01:39:16,489
but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1081
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:18,658
second place...

1082
01:39:18,659 --> 01:39:20,326
- Second place!
- Well done!

1083
01:39:20,327 --> 01:39:24,205
For outstanding moral fiber!

1084
01:39:24,206 --> 01:39:24,706
Yes!

1085
01:39:29,378 --> 01:39:31,212
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1086
01:39:31,213 --> 01:39:33,005
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1087
01:39:33,006 --> 01:39:35,550
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1088
01:39:35,551 --> 01:39:38,386
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1089
01:39:38,387 --> 01:39:40,221
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1090
01:39:40,222 --> 01:39:41,931
Well done, boy.

1091
01:39:41,932 --> 01:39:45,351
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't Spoken.

1092
01:39:45,352 --> 01:39:50,352
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1093
01:39:50,357 --> 01:39:53,985
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1094
01:39:53,986 --> 01:39:57,989
to lose one's family.

1095
01:39:57,990 --> 01:40:02,368
Never whole again, are we?

1096
01:40:02,369 --> 01:40:05,163
Still, life goes on...

1097
01:40:05,164 --> 01:40:09,709
and here we stand.

1098
01:40:09,710 --> 01:40:12,587
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1099
01:40:12,588 --> 01:40:14,213
Bartemius!

1100
01:40:14,214 --> 01:40:18,551
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1101
01:40:18,552 --> 01:40:23,552
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1102
01:40:34,234 --> 01:40:39,234
And they say I'm mad.

1103
01:40:45,412 --> 01:40:49,290
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1104
01:40:49,291 --> 01:40:52,835
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1105
01:40:52,836 --> 01:40:55,588
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1106
01:40:55,589 --> 01:40:59,759
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1107
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,262
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1108
01:41:03,263 --> 01:41:05,014
And Harry, of course.

1109
01:41:05,015 --> 01:41:10,015
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1110
01:41:10,604 --> 01:41:14,065
Hooray!

1111
01:41:14,066 --> 01:41:16,734
<i>Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts.</i>

1112
01:41:16,735 --> 01:41:21,735
<i>Teach us something, please.</i>

1113
01:41:29,331 --> 01:41:34,331
Mr. Crouch?

1114
01:41:37,923 --> 01:41:41,676
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1115
01:41:41,677 --> 01:41:43,427
I will not.

1116
01:41:43,428 --> 01:41:47,640
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1117
01:41:47,641 --> 01:41:49,141
Then for once show them some!

1118
01:41:49,142 --> 01:41:53,437
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1119
01:41:53,438 --> 01:41:56,816
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1120
01:41:56,817 --> 01:41:59,777
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1121
01:41:59,778 --> 01:42:04,778
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1122
01:42:07,786 --> 01:42:09,495
Gh, Harry!

1123
01:42:09,496 --> 01:42:12,665
Harry, how good to see you again.

1124
01:42:12,666 --> 01:42:14,333
I can come back later, professor.

1125
01:42:14,334 --> 01:42:17,837
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1126
01:42:17,838 --> 01:42:20,965
Minister, after you.

1127
01:42:20,966 --> 01:42:23,134
There you are. Your hat.

1128
01:42:23,135 --> 01:42:26,971
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1129
01:42:26,972 --> 01:42:31,972
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1130
01:44:01,608 --> 01:44:03,401
Professor?

1131
01:44:03,402 --> 01:44:08,402
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1132
01:44:16,832 --> 01:44:20,793
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1133
01:44:20,794 --> 01:44:22,878
to present evidence to this Council.

1134
01:44:22,879 --> 01:44:25,756
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1135
01:44:25,757 --> 01:44:29,969
Council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1136
01:44:29,970 --> 01:44:34,765
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1137
01:44:34,766 --> 01:44:37,017
Do you accept these terms?

1138
01:44:37,018 --> 01:44:40,062
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1139
01:44:40,063 --> 01:44:43,065
I have names, sir.

1140
01:44:43,066 --> 01:44:48,066
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1141
01:44:49,322 --> 01:44:52,032
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1142
01:44:52,033 --> 01:44:54,326
- ...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1143
01:44:54,327 --> 01:44:57,163
- If that is all the Witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1144
01:44:57,164 --> 01:45:00,624
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1145
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:03,169
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1146
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:04,462
Yeah, the same.

1147
01:45:04,463 --> 01:45:09,425
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1148
01:45:09,426 --> 01:45:12,845
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1149
01:45:12,846 --> 01:45:15,014
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1150
01:45:15,015 --> 01:45:19,894
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1151
01:45:19,895 --> 01:45:23,022
As the Council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1152
01:45:23,023 --> 01:45:27,193
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1153
01:45:27,194 --> 01:45:30,362
turned spy for us at great
personal risk. - It's a lie!

1154
01:45:30,363 --> 01:45:33,949
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1155
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:36,869
Silence!

1156
01:45:36,870 --> 01:45:40,456
Unless the Witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1157
01:45:40,457 --> 01:45:42,750
this session is now concluded.

1158
01:45:42,751 --> 01:45:45,753
Oh, no, no, no.

1159
01:45:45,754 --> 01:45:47,379
I've heard about one more.

1160
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:50,132
- What's that?
- The name.

1161
01:45:50,133 --> 01:45:51,759
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1162
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,969
this person took part
in the Capture...

1163
01:45:53,970 --> 01:45:56,305
and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1164
01:45:56,306 --> 01:45:59,975
torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1165
01:45:59,976 --> 01:46:02,478
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1166
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:07,479
Barty Crouch...

1167
01:46:07,734 --> 01:46:08,234
Junior.

1168
01:46:18,245 --> 01:46:23,245
Hold him down!

1169
01:46:23,583 --> 01:46:28,583
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1170
01:46:28,922 --> 01:46:31,924
Hello, Father.

1171
01:46:31,925 --> 01:46:36,925
You are no son of mine.

1172
01:46:45,272 --> 01:46:50,272
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1173
01:46:51,111 --> 01:46:52,695
It's a Pensieve.

1174
01:46:52,696 --> 01:46:57,533
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a Wee bit stretched.

1175
01:46:57,534 --> 01:47:01,537
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1176
01:47:01,538 --> 01:47:04,665
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1177
01:47:04,666 --> 01:47:07,626
some small detail...

1178
01:47:07,627 --> 01:47:09,962
something I might have overlooked...

1179
01:47:09,963 --> 01:47:14,963
something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1180
01:47:14,968 --> 01:47:19,889
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1181
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:23,809
It's maddening.

1182
01:47:23,810 --> 01:47:26,353
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1183
01:47:26,354 --> 01:47:28,606
What exactly happened to him?

1184
01:47:28,607 --> 01:47:33,607
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1185
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:39,070
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1186
01:47:39,159 --> 01:47:42,870
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1187
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:47,249
I had a dream about him.

1188
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:52,171
It was in the summer, before school.

1189
01:47:52,172 --> 01:47:55,382
<i>In the dream, I was in</i> a <i>house.</i>

1190
01:47:55,383 --> 01:48:00,346
<i>And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.</i>

1191
01:48:00,347 --> 01:48:04,350
<i>And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.</i>

1192
01:48:04,351 --> 01:48:08,020
<i>- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.</i>

1193
01:48:08,021 --> 01:48:12,691
Always the same one.

1194
01:48:12,692 --> 01:48:15,194
Sir, these dreams...

1195
01:48:15,195 --> 01:48:20,195
what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1196
01:48:22,035 --> 01:48:25,496
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1197
01:48:25,497 --> 01:48:30,497
I think it's best if you simply...

1198
01:48:33,088 --> 01:48:38,088
Cast them away.

1199
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:49,140
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1200
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:58,195
Potter!

1201
01:48:58,196 --> 01:49:03,196
What's your hurry?

1202
01:49:05,829 --> 01:49:09,748
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1203
01:49:09,749 --> 01:49:12,793
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1204
01:49:12,794 --> 01:49:15,254
Yes, sir.

1205
01:49:15,255 --> 01:49:18,507
Ingenious.

1206
01:49:18,508 --> 01:49:23,262
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1207
01:49:23,263 --> 01:49:28,263
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1208
01:49:28,476 --> 01:49:33,476
Nor is this.

1209
01:49:34,607 --> 01:49:37,609
Know what it is?

1210
01:49:37,610 --> 01:49:39,611
Bubble juice, sir?

1211
01:49:39,612 --> 01:49:42,239
Veritaserum.

1212
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:46,118
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1213
01:49:46,119 --> 01:49:51,119
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1214
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:55,127
should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1215
01:49:55,128 --> 01:50:00,128
my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1216
01:50:00,175 --> 01:50:05,175
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1217
01:50:05,722 --> 01:50:10,722
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1218
01:50:12,145 --> 01:50:15,647
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1219
01:50:15,648 --> 01:50:20,648
I'm going to find out why!

1220
01:50:44,677 --> 01:50:49,677
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1221
01:51:05,448 --> 01:51:05,992
<i>Sonorus!</i>

1222
01:51:11,204 --> 01:51:16,204
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1223
01:51:16,709 --> 01:51:21,709
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1224
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:27,469
and Mr. Potter...

1225
01:51:27,470 --> 01:51:29,388
are tied for first position...

1226
01:51:29,389 --> 01:51:34,389
they will be the first to enter
the maze, followed by Mr. Krum...

1227
01:51:34,727 --> 01:51:39,064
- ...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1228
01:51:39,065 --> 01:51:44,065
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1229
01:51:46,531 --> 01:51:49,408
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1230
01:51:49,409 --> 01:51:52,536
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1231
01:51:52,537 --> 01:51:57,374
he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1232
01:51:57,375 --> 01:52:02,375
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1233
01:52:04,424 --> 01:52:08,927
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1234
01:52:08,928 --> 01:52:12,431
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1235
01:52:12,432 --> 01:52:15,642
You see, people change in the maze.

1236
01:52:15,643 --> 01:52:17,519
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1237
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,520
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1238
01:52:23,776 --> 01:52:28,776
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1239
01:52:35,788 --> 01:52:37,664
Good luck.

1240
01:52:37,665 --> 01:52:41,960
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1241
01:52:41,961 --> 01:52:46,961
On the count of three. One...

1242
01:56:12,338 --> 01:56:15,257
Fleur?

1243
01:56:15,258 --> 01:56:15,758
Fleur.

1244
01:56:20,263 --> 01:56:25,263
<i>Periculum!</i>

1245
01:57:00,761 --> 01:57:02,804
Get down!

1246
01:57:02,805 --> 01:57:05,182
Get down!

1247
01:57:05,183 --> 01:57:10,183
<i>Expe/liarmus!</i>

1248
01:57:16,027 --> 01:57:19,404
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1249
01:57:19,405 --> 01:57:24,405
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1250
01:57:33,085 --> 01:57:33,585
Yes.

1251
01:57:55,650 --> 01:57:56,150
Harry!

1252
01:57:59,737 --> 01:58:00,237
Harry!

1253
01:58:03,783 --> 01:58:07,661
Harry!

1254
01:58:07,662 --> 01:58:11,206
Harry!

1255
01:58:11,207 --> 01:58:11,751
<i>Reducto!</i>

1256
01:58:29,809 --> 01:58:32,686
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1257
01:58:32,687 --> 01:58:37,566
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1258
01:58:37,567 --> 01:58:41,152
For a moment, so did I.

1259
01:58:41,153 --> 01:58:43,363
Some game, huh?

1260
01:58:43,364 --> 01:58:48,364
Some game.

1261
01:58:50,204 --> 01:58:50,704
Go!

1262
01:59:02,008 --> 01:59:05,176
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1263
01:59:05,177 --> 01:59:07,345
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1264
01:59:07,346 --> 01:59:12,346
- ...three!
- ...three!

1265
01:59:21,027 --> 01:59:26,027
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1266
01:59:31,037 --> 01:59:36,037
Where are we?

1267
01:59:38,085 --> 01:59:43,085
I've been here before.

1268
01:59:43,382 --> 01:59:46,718
It's a Portkey.

1269
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:51,719
- Harm the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1270
01:59:53,059 --> 01:59:56,645
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1271
01:59:56,646 --> 02:00:01,646
What are you talking about?

1272
02:00:03,861 --> 02:00:08,861
- Harwl What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1273
02:00:14,413 --> 02:00:16,915
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1274
02:00:16,916 --> 02:00:21,916
<i>- A Vada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!</i>

1275
02:00:30,971 --> 02:00:35,971
Do it! Now!

1276
02:00:44,777 --> 02:00:47,445
Bone of the father...

1277
02:00:47,446 --> 02:00:52,446
unwillingly given.

1278
02:00:57,248 --> 02:01:02,248
Flesh of the servant...

1279
02:01:02,294 --> 02:01:07,294
willingly sacrificed.

1280
02:01:09,593 --> 02:01:14,593
And blood of the enemy...

1281
02:01:19,145 --> 02:01:24,145
forcibly taken.

1282
02:01:27,653 --> 02:01:31,406
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1283
02:01:31,407 --> 02:01:32,019
again.

1284
02:02:36,722 --> 02:02:41,722
My wand, Wormtail.

1285
02:02:49,693 --> 02:02:51,820
Hold out your arm.

1286
02:02:51,821 --> 02:02:53,571
Master.

1287
02:02:53,572 --> 02:02:56,407
Thank you, master.

1288
02:02:56,408 --> 02:03:01,408
The other arm, Wormtail.

1289
02:03:38,492 --> 02:03:41,786
Welcome, my friends.

1290
02:03:41,787 --> 02:03:45,206
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1291
02:03:45,207 --> 02:03:50,207
here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1292
02:03:51,630 --> 02:03:55,049
I confess myself...

1293
02:03:55,050 --> 02:03:57,302
disappointed.

1294
02:03:57,303 --> 02:03:59,554
Not one of you tried to find me.

1295
02:03:59,555 --> 02:04:03,808
Crabbe! Macnair!

1296
02:04:03,809 --> 02:04:07,645
Goyle!

1297
02:04:07,646 --> 02:04:12,646
Not even you...

1298
02:04:13,152 --> 02:04:16,946
Lucius.

1299
02:04:16,947 --> 02:04:21,947
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1300
02:04:21,952 --> 02:04:25,121
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1301
02:04:25,122 --> 02:04:30,122
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1302
02:04:32,004 --> 02:04:37,004
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1303
02:04:39,637 --> 02:04:42,639
that is my true mask.

1304
02:04:42,640 --> 02:04:46,684
I returned.

1305
02:04:46,685 --> 02:04:51,685
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1306
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:56,690
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1307
02:05:02,701 --> 02:05:05,620
Thank you, master.

1308
02:05:05,621 --> 02:05:10,458
Thank you.

1309
02:05:10,459 --> 02:05:14,295
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1310
02:05:14,296 --> 02:05:15,964
Harry.

1311
02:05:15,965 --> 02:05:18,925
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1312
02:05:18,926 --> 02:05:23,513
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1313
02:05:23,514 --> 02:05:25,056
I'd introduce you...

1314
02:05:25,057 --> 02:05:30,057
but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1315
02:05:32,022 --> 02:05:34,857
The boy who lived.

1316
02:05:34,858 --> 02:05:37,902
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1317
02:05:37,903 --> 02:05:42,073
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1318
02:05:42,074 --> 02:05:46,995
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1319
02:05:46,996 --> 02:05:48,913
Yes, shall I?

1320
02:05:48,914 --> 02:05:50,415
It was love.

1321
02:05:50,416 --> 02:05:55,086
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1322
02:05:55,087 --> 02:05:58,089
she provided the ultimate protection.

1323
02:05:58,090 --> 02:06:01,134
I could not touch him.

1324
02:06:01,135 --> 02:06:03,428
It was old magic.

1325
02:06:03,429 --> 02:06:05,888
Something I should have foreseen.

1326
02:06:05,889 --> 02:06:07,849
But no matter, no matter.

1327
02:06:07,850 --> 02:06:10,810
Things have changed.

1328
02:06:10,811 --> 02:06:14,939
I can touch you...

1329
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:15,440
now.

1330
02:06:24,783 --> 02:06:25,283
Yeah.

1331
02:06:32,458 --> 02:06:37,295
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1332
02:06:37,296 --> 02:06:40,631
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1333
02:06:40,632 --> 02:06:44,469
Isaid, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1334
02:06:44,470 --> 02:06:46,971
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1335
02:06:46,972 --> 02:06:49,557
First, we bow to each other.

1336
02:06:49,558 --> 02:06:52,101
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1337
02:06:52,102 --> 02:06:55,480
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1338
02:06:55,481 --> 02:06:58,691
I said, bow.

1339
02:06:58,692 --> 02:07:03,446
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1340
02:07:03,447 --> 02:07:03,947
<i>Crucio!</i>

1341
02:07:07,785 --> 02:07:10,578
<i>Crucio!</i>

1342
02:07:10,579 --> 02:07:12,663
Attaboy, Harry.

1343
02:07:12,664 --> 02:07:15,124
Your parents would be proud.

1344
02:07:15,125 --> 02:07:18,669
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1345
02:07:18,670 --> 02:07:23,299
<i>Expe/liar...</i>

1346
02:07:23,300 --> 02:07:25,843
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1347
02:07:25,844 --> 02:07:30,056
I'm going to destroy you.

1348
02:07:30,057 --> 02:07:35,057
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1349
02:07:36,271 --> 02:07:39,023
After tonight, if they Speak of you...

1350
02:07:39,024 --> 02:07:41,984
they'll speak only of how you...

1351
02:07:41,985 --> 02:07:43,986
begged for death.

1352
02:07:43,987 --> 02:07:48,282
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1353
02:07:48,283 --> 02:07:50,201
obliged.

1354
02:07:50,202 --> 02:07:50,702
Get up!

1355
02:07:56,708 --> 02:07:58,876
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1356
02:07:58,877 --> 02:08:01,295
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1357
02:08:01,296 --> 02:08:06,296
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1358
02:08:18,438 --> 02:08:21,232
Have it your way.

1359
02:08:21,233 --> 02:08:26,233
<i>- Expe/liarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!</i>

1360
02:08:41,128 --> 02:08:46,128
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1361
02:08:48,385 --> 02:08:53,385
He's mine!

1362
02:09:23,128 --> 02:09:27,298
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1363
02:09:27,299 --> 02:09:29,550
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1364
02:09:29,551 --> 02:09:32,511
but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1365
02:09:32,512 --> 02:09:35,723
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1366
02:09:35,724 --> 02:09:39,310
Take my body back to my father.

1367
02:09:39,311 --> 02:09:41,103
Let go.

1368
02:09:41,104 --> 02:09:43,898
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1369
02:09:43,899 --> 02:09:48,899
Let go! Let go!

1370
02:09:52,282 --> 02:09:52,782
<i>Accio!</i>

1371
02:09:59,331 --> 02:09:59,831
No!

1372
02:10:14,096 --> 02:10:16,931
He did it!

1373
02:10:16,932 --> 02:10:17,432
Harry!

1374
02:10:21,353 --> 02:10:24,063
Harry!

1375
02:10:24,064 --> 02:10:27,608
No! No! No, don't!

1376
02:10:27,609 --> 02:10:29,777
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1377
02:10:29,778 --> 02:10:32,530
He's back. He's back.

1378
02:10:32,531 --> 02:10:34,699
Voldemort's back.

1379
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:37,285
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1380
02:10:37,286 --> 02:10:39,787
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1381
02:10:39,788 --> 02:10:42,748
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1382
02:10:42,749 --> 02:10:45,209
He's home. You both are.

1383
02:10:45,210 --> 02:10:50,210
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1384
02:10:51,925 --> 02:10:55,886
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1385
02:10:55,887 --> 02:10:57,722
Let me through.

1386
02:10:57,723 --> 02:11:01,183
Let me through!

1387
02:11:01,184 --> 02:11:02,601
Let me through!

1388
02:11:02,602 --> 02:11:05,313
That's my son!

1389
02:11:05,314 --> 02:11:09,567
That's my boy!

1390
02:11:09,568 --> 02:11:14,568
It's my boy!

1391
02:11:15,115 --> 02:11:18,868
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1392
02:11:18,869 --> 02:11:22,496
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1393
02:11:22,497 --> 02:11:22,997
No!

1394
02:11:27,753 --> 02:11:30,338
It's all right, I got you.

1395
02:11:30,339 --> 02:11:35,339
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1396
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:40,598
No!

1397
02:11:40,599 --> 02:11:41,099
No!

1398
02:12:24,851 --> 02:12:27,144
Are you all right, Potter?

1399
02:12:27,145 --> 02:12:29,230
Does it hurt? That?

1400
02:12:29,231 --> 02:12:31,982
Not so much now.

1401
02:12:31,983 --> 02:12:36,983
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1402
02:12:37,197 --> 02:12:41,909
The cup was a Portkey.

1403
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:43,994
Someone had bewitched it.

1404
02:12:43,995 --> 02:12:46,455
What was it like?

1405
02:12:46,456 --> 02:12:48,290
- What was he like?
- Who?

1406
02:12:48,291 --> 02:12:52,336
The Dark Lord.

1407
02:12:52,337 --> 02:12:56,715
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1408
02:12:56,716 --> 02:13:01,345
I don't know.

1409
02:13:01,346 --> 02:13:06,346
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1410
02:13:07,269 --> 02:13:12,269
into one of my nightmares.

1411
02:13:27,998 --> 02:13:29,707
Were there others?

1412
02:13:29,708 --> 02:13:34,708
In the graveyard, were there others?

1413
02:13:35,922 --> 02:13:38,048
L...

1414
02:13:38,049 --> 02:13:43,049
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1415
02:13:49,394 --> 02:13:54,394
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1416
02:13:57,068 --> 02:14:00,321
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1417
02:14:00,322 --> 02:14:05,322
if I hadn't suggested it?

1418
02:14:05,744 --> 02:14:09,622
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1419
02:14:09,623 --> 02:14:13,751
if I hadn't told him first myself?

1420
02:14:13,752 --> 02:14:16,587
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1421
02:14:16,588 --> 02:14:19,924
could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1422
02:14:19,925 --> 02:14:24,925
that led him straight to it?

1423
02:14:29,935 --> 02:14:34,480
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1424
02:14:34,481 --> 02:14:38,275
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But... ".

1425
02:14:38,276 --> 02:14:41,111
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1426
02:14:41,112 --> 02:14:44,782
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1427
02:14:44,783 --> 02:14:47,743
And now the deed is done.

1428
02:14:47,744 --> 02:14:52,744
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1429
02:15:00,590 --> 02:15:05,010
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1430
02:15:05,011 --> 02:15:08,138
that I have once and for all...

1431
02:15:08,139 --> 02:15:12,643
silenced the great Harry Potter.

1432
02:15:12,644 --> 02:15:17,644
<i>Expe/liarmus!</i>

1433
02:15:18,608 --> 02:15:22,319
Severus.

1434
02:15:22,320 --> 02:15:25,823
That's it, take it.

1435
02:15:25,824 --> 02:15:29,451
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1436
02:15:29,452 --> 02:15:32,329
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1437
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:37,330
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1438
02:15:38,461 --> 02:15:43,461
Harry, away from there!

1439
02:16:00,984 --> 02:16:05,279
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1440
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:09,158
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1441
02:16:09,159 --> 02:16:10,409
Polyjuice Potion.

1442
02:16:10,410 --> 02:16:13,871
Now we know Who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1443
02:16:13,872 --> 02:16:18,872
We'll get you up in a minute.

1444
02:16:50,241 --> 02:16:50,741
Harry!

1445
02:16:55,330 --> 02:16:57,748
Barty Crouch Junior.

1446
02:16:57,749 --> 02:17:02,749
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1447
02:17:03,088 --> 02:17:08,088
Your arm, Harry.

1448
02:17:08,635 --> 02:17:11,762
You know what this means, don't you?

1449
02:17:11,763 --> 02:17:14,306
He's back.

1450
02:17:14,307 --> 02:17:17,393
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1451
02:17:17,394 --> 02:17:19,937
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1452
02:17:19,938 --> 02:17:24,938
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1453
02:17:24,943 --> 02:17:27,986
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1454
02:17:27,987 --> 02:17:32,987
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1455
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:54,138
Today, we acknowledge...

1456
02:17:54,139 --> 02:17:58,976
a really terrible loss.

1457
02:17:58,977 --> 02:18:01,937
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1458
02:18:01,938 --> 02:18:05,149
exceptionally hard-working...

1459
02:18:05,150 --> 02:18:08,110
infinitely fair-minded...

1460
02:18:08,111 --> 02:18:10,696
and, most importantly...

1461
02:18:10,697 --> 02:18:15,697
a fierce, fierce friend.

1462
02:18:16,411 --> 02:18:21,411
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1463
02:18:23,835 --> 02:18:26,170
You see...

1464
02:18:26,171 --> 02:18:29,173
Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1465
02:18:29,174 --> 02:18:33,093
by Lord Voldemort!

1466
02:18:33,094 --> 02:18:37,306
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1467
02:18:37,307 --> 02:18:42,307
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1468
02:18:43,188 --> 02:18:45,022
Now, the pain...

1469
02:18:45,023 --> 02:18:48,859
we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1470
02:18:48,860 --> 02:18:50,360
and reminds us...

1471
02:18:50,361 --> 02:18:54,198
that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1472
02:18:54,199 --> 02:18:58,160
our hearts beat as one.

1473
02:18:58,161 --> 02:19:00,537
In light of recent events...

1474
02:19:00,538 --> 02:19:05,538
the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1475
02:19:06,336 --> 02:19:11,336
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1476
02:19:12,091 --> 02:19:14,843
You remember that...

1477
02:19:14,844 --> 02:19:18,388
and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1478
02:19:18,389 --> 02:19:21,391
kind and honest...

1479
02:19:21,392 --> 02:19:26,392
and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1480
02:19:51,214 --> 02:19:53,841
I never liked these curtains.

1481
02:19:53,842 --> 02:19:56,844
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1482
02:19:56,845 --> 02:20:01,845
By accident, of course.

1483
02:20:04,352 --> 02:20:09,352
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1484
02:20:12,110 --> 02:20:14,027
Professor...

1485
02:20:14,028 --> 02:20:17,823
when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1486
02:20:17,824 --> 02:20:22,824
when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1487
02:20:23,788 --> 02:20:28,788
<i>Priori Incantatem.</i>

1488
02:20:30,295 --> 02:20:33,589
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1489
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:36,884
They reappeared.

1490
02:20:36,885 --> 02:20:41,885
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1491
02:20:43,224 --> 02:20:46,310
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1492
02:20:46,311 --> 02:20:51,311
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1493
02:20:54,485 --> 02:20:56,320
But remember this:

1494
02:20:56,321 --> 02:21:00,282
You have friends here.

1495
02:21:00,283 --> 02:21:05,283
You're not alone.

1496
02:21:22,722 --> 02:21:24,848
Hermione.

1497
02:21:24,849 --> 02:21:27,476
This is for you.

1498
02:21:27,477 --> 02:21:30,771
Write to me. Promise.

1499
02:21:30,772 --> 02:21:31,272
Bye.

1500
02:21:38,404 --> 02:21:43,404
<i>Au revoir,</i> Ron.

1501
02:22:24,283 --> 02:22:26,994
Do you think we'll everjust have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1502
02:22:26,995 --> 02:22:28,286
- No.
- No.

1503
02:22:28,287 --> 02:22:33,287
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1504
02:22:37,088 --> 02:22:42,088
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1505
02:22:47,223 --> 02:22:47,723
Yes.

1506
02:22:53,438 --> 02:22:56,898
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1507
02:22:56,899 --> 02:23:00,736
I won't. You know I won't.

1508
02:23:00,737 --> 02:23:05,737
- Harw will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.

1509
02:23:06,285 --> 02:23:31,897
