should be in her vault at Gringotts?

We didn't steal it.

25

There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's
vault identical to this one...

26
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,638
but it is a fake.

27

It was placed there this summer.

28
00:04:28,474 --> 00:04:31,977
- And she never suspected it was a fake?
- The replica is very convincing.

29

Only a goblin would recognize
that this is the true sword of Gryffindor.

Why?

35

There are more than a few curious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.

thought we'd been in there.

48

She kept asking you
what else we'd taken.

49
