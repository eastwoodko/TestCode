00:00:34,407 --> 00:00:38,911
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:43,912
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

3
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:05,687
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:09,566
<i>Lumos Maxima.</i>

00:01:09,567 --> 00:01:14,567
<i>Lumos Maxima!</i>

6
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,641
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:42,642 --> 00:01:47,642
Harry, open the door.

8
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:53,986
Marge. How lovely to see...

9
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:57,531
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:57,532 --> 00:01:59,032
What is it?

11
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,326
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:04,162
Later perhaps, if you behave.

13
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:06,540
I will if she does.

14
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:10,085
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

15
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,879
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,007
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:15,008 --> 00:02:19,511
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:24,057
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-poo?

19
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:26,018
Give me a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

20
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,478
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:28,979
Okay.

22
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,738
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-poo.

23
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,866
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

24
00:02:40,867 --> 00:02:44,411
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

25
00:02:44,412 --> 00:02:46,955
A bit more.

26
00:02:46,956 --> 00:02:50,500
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:02:50,501 --> 00:02:55,501
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:58,342
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:03,343
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,849
What are you smirking at?

31
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,893
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

32
00:03:07,894 --> 00:03:11,355
St. Brutus's. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:11,356 --> 00:03:16,356
Do they use a Cane
at St. Brutus's, boy?

34
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,237
Oh, yeah.

35
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:22,199
Yeah. I've been beaten
loads of times.

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,951
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:28,288
wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:31,583
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:35,671
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:38,006
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

41
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:41,176
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:44,179
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

43
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,180
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:53,980
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:55,982
I think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:03:55,983 --> 00:04:00,404
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

47
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:03,615
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:07,744
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:11,957
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:16,958
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:18,673 --> 00:04:20,590
Right.

52
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:25,591
Let me tell you...

53
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:44,657
Vernon!

54
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:54,328
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

55
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,040
Stop!

56
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:44,170
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.

57
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:48,386
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

58
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:51,389
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

59
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,391
Oh, Vernon.

60
00:05:53,392 --> 00:05:55,310
Oh, God.

61
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:55,811
Marge!

62
00:06:04,195 --> 00:06:07,030
Please!

63
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:10,325
Marge!

64
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:15,326
Come back!

65
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:40,063
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:43,775
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:47,112
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

68
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:50,282
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:50,283 --> 00:06:51,783
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:56,784
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:32,258
"Welcome to the Knight Bus..."

72
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,804
emergency transport
for the stranded witch or Wizard.

73
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:40,805
"My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening."

74
00:08:44,522 --> 00:08:46,690
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:49,067
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?

76
00:08:49,068 --> 00:08:51,903
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on then.

77
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:56,904
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:04,416
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

79
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,334
Well, come on, then. In.

80
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:11,335
No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.

81
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:14,679
Come on.

82
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,230
Come on. Move on, move on.

83
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:47,167
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

84
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:52,168
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:03,975
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

86
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:08,313
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:10:08,314 --> 00:10:11,399
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."

88
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,902
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

89
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:18,903
make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:10:20,117 --> 00:10:22,911
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

91
00:10:22,912 --> 00:10:24,829
They don't see nothing, do they?

92
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,125
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

93
00:10:29,126 --> 00:10:34,126
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

94
00:10:40,888 --> 00:10:43,681
Ten, nine, eight...

95
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:46,559
seven, six, five...

96
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,020
four, three, three and a half...

97
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:51,356
two, one and three quarters.

98
00:10:51,357 --> 00:10:51,857
Yes!

99
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:58,905
Who is that?

100
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:02,951
That man.

101
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:04,953
Who is that?

102
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:06,704
Who is...?

103
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:09,624
That is Sirius Black, that is.

104
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:14,212
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:11:14,213 --> 00:11:16,631
He's a murderer.

106
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:19,926
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:11:19,927 --> 00:11:23,513
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

108
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:26,432
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:29,561
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:11:29,562 --> 00:11:31,771
You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:31,772 --> 00:11:33,815
I reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:35,567
Yeah.

113
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:39,612
Him I've heard of.

114
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:42,782
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

115
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:45,243
They're getting closer, Ernie.

116
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:50,244
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,879
Mind your head.

118
00:12:02,178 --> 00:12:04,345
Hey, guys? Guys?

119
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:09,346
Why the long faces?

120
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:17,354
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:24,949
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

122
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:29,950
Mr. Potter, at last.

123
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:35,623
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

124
00:12:56,523 --> 00:12:57,067
Room 11.

125
00:13:00,945 --> 00:13:02,445
Hedwig.

126
00:13:02,446 --> 00:13:05,448
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

127
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:10,449
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:13:11,038 --> 00:13:14,832
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

129
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:18,211
earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

130
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:22,340
a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:13:22,341 --> 00:13:26,261
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:31,262
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:36,145
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:38,898
So that's that...

135
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:42,443
and no harm done.

136
00:13:42,444 --> 00:13:43,945
Pea soup?

137
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:46,239
No, thank you.

138
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,616
- Minister?
- Yes?

139
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:50,535
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

140
00:13:50,536 --> 00:13:54,330
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

141
00:13:54,331 --> 00:13:57,500
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

142
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:02,501
for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:08,720
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

144
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:11,389
was very, very irresponsible.

145
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,310
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,312
Sirius Black, you mean?

147
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:21,399
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:29,699
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,827
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

151
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:37,828
of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:41,754 --> 00:14:43,296
Hedwig.

153
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:48,297
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

154
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,010
wander.

155
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:57,556
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:19,221
Housekeeping.

157
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:24,685
I'll come back later.

158
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:31,112
I'm warning you, Hermione.

159
00:16:31,113 --> 00:16:35,032
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:16:35,033 --> 00:16:37,243
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:16:37,244 --> 00:16:40,413
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

162
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:43,124
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

163
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,835
coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:45,836 --> 00:16:48,504
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:51,132
Harry.

166
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,718
Harry.

167
00:16:53,719 --> 00:16:57,054
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

168
00:16:57,055 --> 00:17:00,558
like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,895
- Egyptians used to worship Cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

170
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:07,231
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

171
00:17:07,232 --> 00:17:09,817
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:17:09,818 --> 00:17:11,402
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

173
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,696
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:17:13,697 --> 00:17:15,281
- Harm.
- Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:17,617
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

176
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:19,118
- Got everything?
- Yes.

177
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,454
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

178
00:17:21,455 --> 00:17:23,080
- Your Clothes?
- Everything.

179
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:24,457
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

180
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,667
- Harw Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

181
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:30,379
- Harm wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

182
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,174
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

183
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:38,175
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

184
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,893
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

185
00:17:43,894 --> 00:17:46,729
from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:50,233
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:53,486
You are in danger.

188
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,447
Grave danger.

189
00:17:56,448 --> 00:17:59,909
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

190
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,453
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

191
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:06,874
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

192
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,835
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

193
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:11,837
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

194
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,339
Sorry.

195
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,425
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:18,219
Black lost everything.

197
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,682
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:25,017
And in his mind...

199
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:28,187
you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

200
00:18:28,188 --> 00:18:32,149
of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,443
And that is why...

202
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:37,321
he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:18:37,322 --> 00:18:40,491
To find you.

204
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:43,077
And kill me.

205
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:45,913
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

206
00:18:45,914 --> 00:18:48,833
you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:18:48,834 --> 00:18:50,334
Mr. Weasley...

208
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:55,131
why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:57,049
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,594
Ron, Ron!

211
00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:01,887
Oh, for goodness' sake!

212
00:19:01,888 --> 00:19:05,391
Don't lose him!

213
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:07,685
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

214
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:10,271
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

215
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:14,025
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:15,943
I was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:19:15,944 --> 00:19:18,571
I still think it was brilliant.

218
00:19:18,572 --> 00:19:23,572
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:25,286
Who do you think that is?

220
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:28,331
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

221
00:19:28,332 --> 00:19:30,625
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:34,045
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

223
00:19:34,046 --> 00:19:39,046
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

224
00:19:39,051 --> 00:19:44,051
I gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,069
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

226
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,154
- ...to come after you?
- Yeah.

227
00:20:00,155 --> 00:20:02,239
But they'll Catch Black, won't they?

228
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,201
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

229
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:08,704
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

230
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:13,705
- ...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

231
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:16,671
Why are we stopping?

232
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:21,672
We can't be there yet.

233
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:25,096
What's going on?

234
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:29,684
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:32,895
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:37,896
There's something moving out there.

237
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:53,412
I think someone's coming aboard.

238
00:21:16,648 --> 00:21:21,648
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,141
Harry.

240
00:22:34,142 --> 00:22:39,142
Harry, are you all right?

241
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,985
Thank you.

242
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:47,905
Here, eat this. It'll help.

243
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:52,906
It's all right. It's chocolate.

244
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:58,582
What was that thing that came?

245
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:02,211
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

246
00:23:02,212 --> 00:23:05,089
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:10,090
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:23:13,306 --> 00:23:18,306
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:23,524
What happened to me?

250
00:23:23,525 --> 00:23:25,442
Well, you sort of went rigid.

251
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:30,364
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:23:30,365 --> 00:23:32,324
And did either of you two...

253
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:33,826
you know...

254
00:23:33,827 --> 00:23:37,079
- ...pass out?
- No.

255
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,956
I felt Weird, though.

256
00:23:38,957 --> 00:23:42,042
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:23:42,043 --> 00:23:44,420
But someone was screaming.

258
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:46,755
A woman.

259
00:23:46,756 --> 00:23:51,756
No one was screaming, Harry.

260
00:24:47,943 --> 00:24:52,029
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,198
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

262
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:58,702
before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:24:58,703 --> 00:25:02,206
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

264
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:04,833
Who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

265
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:07,461
of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:12,462
Good luck, professor.

267
00:25:14,594 --> 00:25:18,097
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

268
00:25:18,098 --> 00:25:21,600
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

269
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:24,770
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

270
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:26,939
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

271
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,525
Cur Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

272
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:31,568
has decided to retire...

273
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:35,531
in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:38,409
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

275
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,412
that his place will be taken
by none other...

276
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:46,413
than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:25:57,012 --> 00:26:00,014
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

278
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:02,725
at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:07,726
Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

280
00:26:08,565 --> 00:26:12,985
until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:16,822
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:18,657
Now whilst I've been assured...

283
00:26:18,658 --> 00:26:22,494
that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

284
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:24,038
a word of caution.

285
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,374
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

286
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:30,961
between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:34,757
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

288
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:39,136
to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:26:39,137 --> 00:26:44,137
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:26:46,394 --> 00:26:49,855
But you know,
happiness can be found...

291
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:54,693
even in the darkest of times...

292
00:26:54,694 --> 00:26:59,694
if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:15,422
<i>Fortuna Major.</i>

294
00:27:15,423 --> 00:27:18,300
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:21,386
<i>- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.</i>

296
00:27:21,387 --> 00:27:26,387
Watch this.

297
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:38,983
<i>- Amazing. Just with</i> my <i>voice.
- Fortuna Major.</i>

298
00:27:39,155 --> 00:27:44,155
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

299
00:27:44,702 --> 00:27:46,870
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:50,249
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

301
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:53,460
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

302
00:27:53,461 --> 00:27:55,796
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

303
00:27:55,797 --> 00:27:59,758
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,594
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

305
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:04,972
Do not give him one again.

306
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:09,973
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

307
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:19,691
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

308
00:28:22,115 --> 00:28:24,700
I think we have a winner.

309
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:27,661
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

310
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:32,662
Look at him. His face.

311
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:16,251
<i>Welcome, my children.</i>

312
00:29:16,252 --> 00:29:21,252
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:29:21,507 --> 00:29:26,507
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:29:28,223 --> 00:29:32,351
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:29:32,352 --> 00:29:37,189
Together we shall Cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:41,193
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:29:41,194 --> 00:29:45,280
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,823
What do you see?

319
00:29:46,824 --> 00:29:51,824
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

320
00:29:52,705 --> 00:29:55,290
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:29:55,291 --> 00:30:00,003
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

322
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:02,089
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

323
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,925
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

324
00:30:04,926 --> 00:30:07,886
ls your grandmother quite well?

325
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:09,513
I think so.

326
00:30:09,514 --> 00:30:14,514
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:16,895
Pity.

328
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:21,896
Broaden your minds.

329
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:26,613
Your aura is passing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:30:26,614 --> 00:30:28,740
- I think you are.
- Sure.

331
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:31,118
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,662
Yeah.

333
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:38,542
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:30:38,543 --> 00:30:42,379
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

335
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,880
So...

336
00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:48,135
you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:30:48,136 --> 00:30:52,055
Give me the cup.

338
00:30:52,056 --> 00:30:56,018
Oh, my dear boy.

339
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:59,354
My dear...

340
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:03,275
you have the Grim.

341
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:05,193
The Grin? What's the Grin?

342
00:31:05,194 --> 00:31:08,238
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:10,615
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog."

344
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:13,618
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:15,454
It's an omen...

346
00:31:15,455 --> 00:31:20,455
"...of death."

347
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,839
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

348
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,926
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

349
00:31:29,927 --> 00:31:33,764
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

350
00:31:33,765 --> 00:31:37,059
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
Classes are you taking?

351
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,894
A fair few.

352
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:41,146
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:44,107
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:31:44,108 --> 00:31:46,276
You have to be in two
Classes at once.

355
00:31:46,277 --> 00:31:49,821
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two Classes at once?

356
00:31:49,822 --> 00:31:54,822
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."

357
00:31:55,244 --> 00:31:59,373
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

358
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:01,375
I got a real treat for you today.

359
00:32:01,376 --> 00:32:06,376
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:32:14,639 --> 00:32:17,891
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:20,560
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:22,396
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:27,397
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:40,660
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

365
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:46,545
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:49,214
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:53,844
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching Classes.

368
00:32:53,845 --> 00:32:58,845
Shut up, Malfoy.

369
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:14,694
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:33:19,704 --> 00:33:22,998
- Just turn away.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:23,499
Yeah.

372
00:33:34,677 --> 00:33:37,846
Isn't he beautiful?

373
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:41,057
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:33:41,058 --> 00:33:43,518
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

375
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,729
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

376
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,441
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:53,487
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:33:53,488 --> 00:33:56,406
It may be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:33:56,407 --> 00:34:01,407
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:07,209
Well done, Harry. Well done.

381
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,127
Come on now.

382
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:10,670
Now...

383
00:34:10,671 --> 00:34:14,549
you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

384
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,635
step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:19,221
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:34:19,222 --> 00:34:21,515
If he does, you can go and touch him.

387
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:26,516
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

388
00:34:27,396 --> 00:34:31,024
Just make your bow.

389
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:36,025
Nice and low.

390
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:41,576
Back off, Harry. Back off.

391
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:44,746
Keep still.

392
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:49,747
Keep still.

393
00:34:54,924 --> 00:34:59,924
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

394
00:35:01,847 --> 00:35:04,599
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:19,860
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:35:20,658 --> 00:35:25,658
Not so fast, Harry.

398
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:30,625
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

399
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:35,626
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:38,216
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

401
00:35:38,217 --> 00:35:40,635
That's it...

402
00:35:40,636 --> 00:35:42,554
Yes!

403
00:35:42,555 --> 00:35:46,141
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

404
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:48,351
Does he get to fly?

405
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,937
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

406
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:52,647
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

407
00:35:52,648 --> 00:35:56,484
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:35:56,485 --> 00:36:01,485
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:45,510
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

410
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:47,637
That was wicked, Harry!

411
00:37:47,638 --> 00:37:49,806
Oh, please.

412
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:52,809
Well done, well done.

413
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:57,810
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

414
00:37:59,442 --> 00:38:03,862
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

415
00:38:03,863 --> 00:38:06,156
Malfoy, no...

416
00:38:06,157 --> 00:38:08,324
No!

417
00:38:08,325 --> 00:38:10,160
Buckbeak!

418
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:13,455
Whoa, Whoa, whoa...

419
00:38:13,456 --> 00:38:16,374
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,918
Away, you silly creature...

421
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:22,213
- it's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

422
00:38:22,214 --> 00:38:23,590
Hagñdl.

423
00:38:23,591 --> 00:38:28,591
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:34,893
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

425
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:39,894
You and your bloody Chicken!

426
00:39:00,669 --> 00:39:02,921
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

427
00:39:02,922 --> 00:39:06,925
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

428
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:10,595
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

429
00:39:10,596 --> 00:39:13,723
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

430
00:39:13,724 --> 00:39:18,186
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

431
00:39:18,187 --> 00:39:22,106
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:39:22,107 --> 00:39:24,150
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

433
00:39:24,151 --> 00:39:26,903
Sirius Black!

434
00:39:26,904 --> 00:39:30,323
Duff town? That's not far from here.

435
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:33,117
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

436
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:35,787
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

437
00:39:35,788 --> 00:39:39,332
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:44,333
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:49,672
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:18,951
Intriguing, isn't it?

441
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,208
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

442
00:40:22,209 --> 00:40:24,210
as to what is inside?

443
00:40:24,211 --> 00:40:28,965
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

444
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:32,093
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:40:32,094 --> 00:40:34,345
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

446
00:40:34,346 --> 00:40:36,055
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:40:36,056 --> 00:40:39,475
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:44,105
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

449
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:49,106
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:40:50,946 --> 00:40:54,991
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

451
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:57,702
<i>After me. Riddiku/us!</i>

452
00:40:57,703 --> 00:41:00,038
<i>- Riddiku/us!
- Very</i> good.

453
00:41:00,039 --> 00:41:02,749
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,168
<i>- Riddiku/us!
- Riddiku/us!</i>

455
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:07,462
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

456
00:41:07,463 --> 00:41:11,674
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:41:11,675 --> 00:41:15,595
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:20,183
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:41:20,184 --> 00:41:24,520
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

460
00:41:24,521 --> 00:41:27,857
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:41:27,858 --> 00:41:29,984
Come on.

462
00:41:29,985 --> 00:41:33,696
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:41:33,697 --> 00:41:35,573
Professor Snape.

464
00:41:35,574 --> 00:41:37,575
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

465
00:41:37,576 --> 00:41:41,162
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

466
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:46,163
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

467
00:41:46,168 --> 00:41:48,586
No...

468
00:41:48,587 --> 00:41:51,631
it won't. I want you
to picture her Clothes.

469
00:41:51,632 --> 00:41:55,051
Only her Clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

470
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:58,304
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

471
00:41:58,305 --> 00:42:02,392
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

472
00:42:02,393 --> 00:42:06,145
here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:42:06,146 --> 00:42:09,273
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's Clothes.

474
00:42:09,274 --> 00:42:11,567
Can you do that?

475
00:42:11,568 --> 00:42:14,612
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:42:14,613 --> 00:42:19,613
One, two, three.

477
00:42:27,918 --> 00:42:32,547
Think, Neville, think.

478
00:42:32,548 --> 00:42:37,548
<i>Riddiku/us!</i>

479
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:42,015
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:42:42,016 --> 00:42:47,016
to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

481
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:52,650
Form a line!

482
00:42:52,651 --> 00:42:56,279
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,574
and turn it into something funny.

484
00:42:59,575 --> 00:43:04,495
Next! Ron!

485
00:43:04,496 --> 00:43:09,496
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:21,804
Wand at the ready, Ron.

487
00:43:21,805 --> 00:43:23,806
<i>Riddiku/us!</i>

488
00:43:23,807 --> 00:43:25,767
Yes!

489
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:29,145
You see? Very good, very good!

490
00:43:29,146 --> 00:43:34,146
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:43:36,779 --> 00:43:41,779
Show us what you see.

492
00:43:48,248 --> 00:43:51,834
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:54,837
<i>Riddiku/us!</i>

494
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:57,882
And next! Step up, step UP!

495
00:43:57,883 --> 00:44:02,883
Wonderful, wonderful!

496
00:44:13,732 --> 00:44:14,232
Here!

497
00:44:21,698 --> 00:44:26,698
<i>Riddiku/us!</i>

498
00:44:32,042 --> 00:44:35,128
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:44:35,129 --> 00:44:37,296
Collect your books from the back.

500
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:40,091
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:45,092
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:44:45,139 --> 00:44:50,017
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:53,020
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

504
00:44:53,021 --> 00:44:56,399
that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,861
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

506
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:01,612
That's the rule, Potter.

507
00:45:01,613 --> 00:45:04,991
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

508
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:07,660
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

509
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:10,329
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:45:10,330 --> 00:45:15,330
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:45:15,836 --> 00:45:20,836
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:45:21,633 --> 00:45:26,633
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

513
00:45:38,692 --> 00:45:40,943
Professor, can I ask you something?

514
00:45:40,944 --> 00:45:44,989
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

515
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,574
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:49,577
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:45:49,578 --> 00:45:53,289
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:56,083
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:45:56,084 --> 00:45:58,794
- ...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

520
00:45:58,795 --> 00:46:01,839
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,507
This is very wise.

522
00:46:03,508 --> 00:46:05,843
Before I fainted...

523
00:46:05,844 --> 00:46:08,387
I heard something.

524
00:46:08,388 --> 00:46:10,473
A woman...

525
00:46:10,474 --> 00:46:12,016
screaming.

526
00:46:12,017 --> 00:46:15,478
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:46:15,479 --> 00:46:19,232
Cur pain becomes their power.

528
00:46:19,233 --> 00:46:21,609
I think it was my mother...

529
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:25,446
the night she was murdered.

530
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:30,447
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:46:30,494 --> 00:46:33,746
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

532
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:36,832
They're your mother, Lily's.

533
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,626
Yes.

534
00:46:38,627 --> 00:46:43,627
Oh, yes. I knew her.

535
00:46:43,966 --> 00:46:48,010
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:46:48,011 --> 00:46:51,389
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:55,226
she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:46:55,227 --> 00:46:58,479
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,480
even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:47:06,113 --> 00:47:08,990
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

541
00:47:08,991 --> 00:47:11,033
he...

542
00:47:11,034 --> 00:47:16,034
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

543
00:47:16,665 --> 00:47:21,665
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

544
00:47:26,174 --> 00:47:29,969
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

545
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,970
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,147
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:43,858
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:48,859
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

549
00:47:49,281 --> 00:47:50,948
What's going on?

550
00:47:50,949 --> 00:47:53,576
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:47:53,577 --> 00:47:56,162
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

552
00:47:56,163 --> 00:48:01,163
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:03,919
Get back, all of you.

554
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,256
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:48:07,257 --> 00:48:10,676
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:48:10,677 --> 00:48:13,304
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:48:13,305 --> 00:48:17,224
It's not funny, Ron.

558
00:48:17,225 --> 00:48:22,225
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:48:27,652 --> 00:48:28,819
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

560
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:31,072
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

561
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:36,073
You heard. Move!

562
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:50,383
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:48:50,384 --> 00:48:54,678
Tell them to search every painting
in the Castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:58,599
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

565
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,560
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:04,146
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:49:04,147 --> 00:49:06,982
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:49:06,983 --> 00:49:11,983
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

569
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:17,785
Dear lady, who did this to you?

570
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:22,786
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:26,919
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,630
He's here, Somewhere in the Castle!

573
00:49:29,631 --> 00:49:32,007
Sirius Black!

574
00:49:32,008 --> 00:49:37,008
Secure the Castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

575
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:10,208
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:13,048
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

577
00:50:13,049 --> 00:50:15,176
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

578
00:50:15,177 --> 00:50:18,053
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the Castle.

579
00:50:18,054 --> 00:50:21,807
I didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:50:21,808 --> 00:50:24,310
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

581
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:26,770
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

582
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:29,648
- ...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

583
00:50:29,649 --> 00:50:31,692
Any theories on how
he managed it?

584
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:34,904
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:50:34,905 --> 00:50:36,614
You may recall...

586
00:50:36,615 --> 00:50:39,617
prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

587
00:50:39,618 --> 00:50:41,869
about your appointment
of Professor...

588
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:46,123
Not a single professor inside this Castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:50:46,124 --> 00:50:48,709
I'm quite convinced the Castle is safe...

590
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,505
and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:55,049
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,552
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

593
00:50:58,553 --> 00:51:03,553
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:51:03,558 --> 00:51:08,558
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:51:47,394 --> 00:51:52,394
Turn to page 394.

596
00:52:00,156 --> 00:52:04,451
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:52:04,452 --> 00:52:08,038
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

598
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:12,126
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:17,127
at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:52:22,012 --> 00:52:24,013
"Werewolves"?

601
00:52:24,014 --> 00:52:27,016
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:52:27,017 --> 00:52:30,352
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- QuieL.

603
00:52:30,353 --> 00:52:34,148
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:52:34,149 --> 00:52:37,860
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:52:37,861 --> 00:52:40,988
between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:43,407
No one?

607
00:52:43,408 --> 00:52:46,535
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

608
00:52:46,536 --> 00:52:49,872
An Animagus is a Wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:52:49,873 --> 00:52:51,832
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:53,709
With each full moon...

611
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:57,796
he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:52:57,797 --> 00:53:02,551
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:53:02,552 --> 00:53:05,471
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:53:05,472 --> 00:53:07,973
you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

615
00:53:07,974 --> 00:53:10,142
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:13,771
or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:53:13,772 --> 00:53:17,399
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,196
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

619
00:53:22,197 --> 00:53:26,075
two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

620
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:29,745
- ...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

621
00:53:29,746 --> 00:53:33,290
Then I Suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

622
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:37,544
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:38,157
Page 394.

624
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:45,678
The term "werewolf"...

625
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,679
is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...

626
00:53:50,934 --> 00:53:55,934
which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.

627
00:53:56,022 --> 00:53:58,565
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:53:58,566 --> 00:54:01,819
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:06,820
being bitten by a werewolf...

630
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:27,549
Go, Harry! Go Harry!

631
00:56:25,964 --> 00:56:30,964
<i>Aresto momentum!</i>

632
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:34,346
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

633
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:36,807
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

634
00:56:36,808 --> 00:56:39,893
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:56:39,894 --> 00:56:44,894
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:49,778
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

637
00:56:49,779 --> 00:56:51,989
You gave us a right good scare.

638
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:55,784
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

639
00:56:55,785 --> 00:57:00,785
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

640
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:04,459
No one blames you, Harry.

641
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,505
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:57:08,506 --> 00:57:10,757
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

643
00:57:10,758 --> 00:57:14,970
There's something else
you should know too.

644
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:19,971
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

645
00:57:21,811 --> 00:57:24,563
Well...

646
00:57:24,564 --> 00:57:27,149
<i>I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.</i>

647
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:29,985
Is there no Chance of fixing it?

648
00:57:29,986 --> 00:57:31,528
No.

649
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:35,282
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:38,535
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

651
00:57:38,536 --> 00:57:41,914
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:57:41,915 --> 00:57:46,710
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

653
00:57:46,711 --> 00:57:51,506
until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:57:51,507 --> 00:57:55,886
You are not weak, Harry.

655
00:57:55,887 --> 00:58:00,182
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:58:00,183 --> 00:58:03,727
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:58:03,728 --> 00:58:06,229
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:10,442
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:58:10,443 --> 00:58:14,112
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:58:14,113 --> 00:58:16,323
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:18,367
There was only one that night.

662
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:23,288
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

663
00:58:23,289 --> 00:58:28,289
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

664
00:58:28,419 --> 00:58:32,255
perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:58:32,256 --> 00:58:37,256
For now, I need to rest.

666
00:58:59,617 --> 00:59:04,617
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

667
00:59:19,512 --> 00:59:21,680
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

668
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:24,766
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

669
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:27,769
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

670
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:29,271
We'll get you there.

671
00:59:29,272 --> 00:59:32,024
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- If you pipe down.

672
00:59:32,025 --> 00:59:36,236
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

673
00:59:36,237 --> 00:59:40,240
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

674
00:59:40,241 --> 00:59:42,617
What are you doing?!

675
00:59:42,618 --> 00:59:45,620
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

676
00:59:45,621 --> 00:59:49,124
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

677
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:52,210
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:59:52,211 --> 00:59:54,129
George, if you will.

679
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:59,130
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

680
01:00:01,054 --> 01:00:05,057
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

681
01:00:05,058 --> 01:00:08,268
are proud to present
the Marauder's Map."

682
01:00:08,269 --> 01:00:13,269
We owe them so much.

683
01:00:14,067 --> 01:00:18,070
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

684
01:00:18,071 --> 01:00:20,989
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

685
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,157
- In his study.
- Pacing.

686
01:00:22,158 --> 01:00:24,367
Does that a lot.

687
01:00:24,368 --> 01:00:26,411
- So this map shows...?
- Everyone.

688
01:00:26,412 --> 01:00:28,580
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

689
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:29,873
- Every minute.
- Every day.

690
01:00:29,874 --> 01:00:33,043
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

691
01:00:33,044 --> 01:00:35,962
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

692
01:00:35,963 --> 01:00:38,799
- ...out of the Castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

693
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,135
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

694
01:00:42,136 --> 01:00:44,137
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
01:00:44,138 --> 01:00:47,724
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

696
01:00:47,725 --> 01:00:52,725
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

697
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:32,390
Now, how much do you want?

698
01:01:36,899 --> 01:01:41,899
Delicious.

699
01:01:46,826 --> 01:01:51,079
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

700
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,456
Twice.

701
01:01:53,457 --> 01:01:56,001
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
01:01:56,002 --> 01:01:58,003
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
01:01:58,004 --> 01:02:01,047
Actually, I'm fine here.

704
01:02:01,048 --> 01:02:03,258
Well, well. Look Who's here.

705
01:02:03,259 --> 01:02:05,760
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
01:02:05,761 --> 01:02:10,265
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
01:02:10,266 --> 01:02:13,768
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

708
01:02:13,769 --> 01:02:18,769
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
01:02:19,108 --> 01:02:22,694
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

710
01:02:22,695 --> 01:02:27,695
You filthy little mudblood!

711
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:33,910
Who is that?

712
01:02:36,667 --> 01:02:41,667
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

713
01:02:58,856 --> 01:03:03,856
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:03:05,112 --> 01:03:06,988
Get out of the way!

715
01:03:06,989 --> 01:03:08,782
Move!

716
01:03:08,783 --> 01:03:13,783
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:03:15,539 --> 01:03:17,666
Harry!

718
01:03:17,667 --> 01:03:22,667
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,341
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

720
01:03:26,342 --> 01:03:30,011
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:03:30,012 --> 01:03:34,140
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

722
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:36,851
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:03:36,852 --> 01:03:39,312
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

724
01:03:39,313 --> 01:03:41,356
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

725
01:03:41,357 --> 01:03:42,941
Allow me, minister.

726
01:03:42,942 --> 01:03:44,985
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

727
01:03:44,986 --> 01:03:48,113
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

728
01:03:48,114 --> 01:03:52,158
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:56,621
- ...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

730
01:03:56,622 --> 01:04:00,166
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:02,794
And what would bring him here?

732
01:04:02,795 --> 01:04:07,132
- Harw Potter.
- Harw Potter?

733
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:07,633
Come.

734
01:04:11,429 --> 01:04:11,929
Harry!

735
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:25,817
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

736
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:28,069
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

737
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,863
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

738
01:04:29,864 --> 01:04:33,783
- Who are they Calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

739
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:37,871
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:04:37,872 --> 01:04:42,872
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

741
01:04:44,587 --> 01:04:46,546
Tell me what this is all about.

742
01:04:46,547 --> 01:04:51,176
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

743
01:04:51,177 --> 01:04:54,054
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:04:54,055 --> 01:04:58,099
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,478
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

746
01:05:01,479 --> 01:05:05,106
he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:05:05,107 --> 01:05:07,442
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

748
01:05:07,443 --> 01:05:09,861
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.

749
01:05:09,862 --> 01:05:11,863
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:05:11,864 --> 01:05:14,783
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...

751
01:05:14,784 --> 01:05:19,162
and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

752
01:05:19,163 --> 01:05:23,208
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

753
01:05:23,209 --> 01:05:26,002
He destroyed him!

754
01:05:26,003 --> 01:05:30,924
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:05:30,925 --> 01:05:34,135
Sirius Black may not have
put his hand to the Potters...

756
01:05:34,136 --> 01:05:37,555
- ...but he's why they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

757
01:05:37,556 --> 01:05:40,600
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

758
01:05:40,601 --> 01:05:44,562
- What could be Worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:05:44,563 --> 01:05:47,148
and remains to this day...

760
01:05:47,149 --> 01:05:52,149
Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:02,410
Ron, look!

762
01:06:05,418 --> 01:06:10,418
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

763
01:06:46,459 --> 01:06:50,795
Harry, what happened?

764
01:06:50,796 --> 01:06:53,423
He was their friend...

765
01:06:53,424 --> 01:06:56,468
and he betrayed them.

766
01:06:56,469 --> 01:07:00,680
He was their friend!

767
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:03,266
I hope he finds me.

768
01:07:03,267 --> 01:07:06,060
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

769
01:07:06,061 --> 01:07:11,061
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

770
01:07:22,953 --> 01:07:25,079
<i>Harry.</i>

771
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:27,123
<i>There you are. You came.</i>

772
01:07:27,124 --> 01:07:31,169
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

773
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,796
well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:07:33,797 --> 01:07:35,924
I'm sure.

775
01:07:35,925 --> 01:07:38,635
Well, everything's prepared.

776
01:07:38,636 --> 01:07:42,222
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:07:42,223 --> 01:07:43,848
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:07:43,849 --> 01:07:45,683
No? Well...

779
01:07:45,684 --> 01:07:49,437
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

780
01:07:49,438 --> 01:07:54,275
it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:07:54,276 --> 01:07:58,279
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,450
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

783
01:08:02,451 --> 01:08:07,451
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:08:07,456 --> 01:08:11,459
Close your eyes.

785
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:14,587
Concentrate.

786
01:08:14,588 --> 01:08:17,173
Explore your past.

787
01:08:17,174 --> 01:08:20,635
Do you have a memory?

788
01:08:20,636 --> 01:08:23,555
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:08:23,556 --> 01:08:25,974
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:08:25,975 --> 01:08:30,975
Then Speak the incantation,
<i>Expecto</i> Patronum.

791
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:36,730
<i>- Expecto Patronum.
- Very</i> good.

792
01:08:38,362 --> 01:08:43,362
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:08:59,508 --> 01:09:02,885
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

794
01:09:02,886 --> 01:09:06,514
<i>Expecto... Expecto...</i>

795
01:09:06,515 --> 01:09:10,226
<i>Expect...</i>

796
01:09:10,227 --> 01:09:14,606
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:09:14,607 --> 01:09:18,818
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:23,819
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:09:24,783 --> 01:09:27,869
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

800
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:30,788
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:34,125
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

802
01:09:34,126 --> 01:09:36,919
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

803
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:41,841
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

804
01:09:41,842 --> 01:09:46,842
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:09:52,061 --> 01:09:57,061
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

806
01:09:59,234 --> 01:10:01,527
Well, it is.

807
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:04,280
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

808
01:10:04,281 --> 01:10:09,281
- ...but it's Complicated.
- Is it strong?

809
01:10:12,623 --> 01:10:17,251
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?

810
01:10:17,252 --> 01:10:22,252
Just do it.

811
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:33,559
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

812
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:38,560
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

813
01:10:59,128 --> 01:11:02,171
Yes!

814
01:11:02,172 --> 01:11:06,134
Well done, Harry. Well done!

815
01:11:06,135 --> 01:11:10,430
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:13,015
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

817
01:11:13,016 --> 01:11:14,976
And just so you know, Harry...

818
01:11:14,977 --> 01:11:19,147
I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:11:19,148 --> 01:11:23,359
is saying something.

820
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,528
I was thinking of him.

821
01:11:25,529 --> 01:11:27,864
And Mum.

822
01:11:27,865 --> 01:11:30,742
Seeing their faces.

823
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:33,619
They were talking to me.

824
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:36,038
Just talking.

825
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:40,001
That's the memory I Chose.

826
01:11:40,002 --> 01:11:42,962
I don't even know if it's real.

827
01:11:42,963 --> 01:11:47,963
But it's the best I have.

828
01:11:54,349 --> 01:11:56,851
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

829
01:11:56,852 --> 01:11:59,020
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:11:59,021 --> 01:12:01,606
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:12:01,607 --> 01:12:04,942
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

832
01:12:04,943 --> 01:12:07,236
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

833
01:12:07,237 --> 01:12:10,740
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

834
01:12:10,741 --> 01:12:14,827
is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:12:14,828 --> 01:12:17,872
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

836
01:12:17,873 --> 01:12:20,124
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

837
01:12:20,125 --> 01:12:23,669
- Did.
- Didn't.

838
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:26,464
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:12:26,465 --> 01:12:29,926
Well, first off, the Committee members
took turns...

840
01:12:29,927 --> 01:12:34,472
talking about why we were there.

841
01:12:34,473 --> 01:12:37,308
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

842
01:12:37,309 --> 01:12:40,478
was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:43,689
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

844
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:47,068
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous Creature...

845
01:12:47,069 --> 01:12:50,321
who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:12:50,322 --> 01:12:52,824
And then?

847
01:12:52,825 --> 01:12:55,701
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

848
01:12:55,702 --> 01:13:00,702
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

849
01:13:01,917 --> 01:13:06,917
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

850
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:36,780
Spiders! There's... There's Spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:13:37,536 --> 01:13:40,288
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders.

852
01:13:40,289 --> 01:13:45,289
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

853
01:14:02,394 --> 01:14:04,729
<i>- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of</i> a <i>boy.</i>

854
01:14:04,730 --> 01:14:08,065
<i>- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.</i>

855
01:14:08,066 --> 01:14:13,066
<i>He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!</i>

856
01:14:18,619 --> 01:14:23,619
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

857
01:15:05,332 --> 01:15:10,332
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:15:17,678 --> 01:15:22,473
Mischief managed. Nox.

859
01:15:22,474 --> 01:15:23,975
Potter.

860
01:15:23,976 --> 01:15:27,645
What are you doing
wandering the Corridors at night?

861
01:15:27,646 --> 01:15:28,896
I was sleepwalking.

862
01:15:28,897 --> 01:15:31,691
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

863
01:15:31,692 --> 01:15:36,654
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the Castle.

864
01:15:36,655 --> 01:15:41,655
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

865
01:15:41,743 --> 01:15:46,743
Now, if you don't mind, I would
appreciate it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:51,877
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:15:51,878 --> 01:15:56,878
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:15:57,426 --> 01:15:59,218
What's this?

869
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:04,219
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

870
01:16:09,062 --> 01:16:14,062
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:16:16,528 --> 01:16:20,448
Read it.

872
01:16:20,449 --> 01:16:25,449
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

873
01:16:26,121 --> 01:16:30,541
offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and..."

874
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:33,210
Go on.

875
01:16:33,211 --> 01:16:37,298
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business."

876
01:16:37,299 --> 01:16:41,469
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

877
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,346
Well, well. Lupin.

878
01:16:44,347 --> 01:16:49,347
Out for a little walk in the moonlight,
are we?

879
01:16:50,437 --> 01:16:53,064
Harry, are you all right?

880
01:16:53,065 --> 01:16:56,358
That remains to be seen.

881
01:16:56,359 --> 01:17:00,279
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:03,991
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:17:03,992 --> 01:17:08,954
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

884
01:17:08,955 --> 01:17:12,625
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

885
01:17:12,626 --> 01:17:16,670
who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:21,092
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:17:21,093 --> 01:17:24,386
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

888
01:17:24,387 --> 01:17:29,387
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

889
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:38,730
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:44,824
Come in.

891
01:17:44,825 --> 01:17:49,825
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

892
01:17:50,205 --> 01:17:54,875
but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:17:54,876 --> 01:17:58,712
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

894
01:17:58,713 --> 01:18:01,549
is a map to you?

895
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:06,011
- No.
- No, sir.

896
01:18:06,012 --> 01:18:09,223
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:18:09,224 --> 01:18:14,186
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:18:14,187 --> 01:18:18,440
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the Castle unprotected...

899
01:18:18,441 --> 01:18:23,112
with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

900
01:18:23,113 --> 01:18:25,447
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

901
01:18:25,448 --> 01:18:28,075
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

902
01:18:28,076 --> 01:18:31,912
I want you to return to your dormitow
and stay there.

903
01:18:31,913 --> 01:18:36,913
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

904
01:18:41,339 --> 01:18:46,339
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

905
01:18:46,636 --> 01:18:51,636
Earlier, it showed someone in the Castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

906
01:18:52,017 --> 01:18:54,935
Oh, really? And who might that be?

907
01:18:54,936 --> 01:18:59,106
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:18:59,107 --> 01:19:02,401
That's not possible.

909
01:19:02,402 --> 01:19:06,906
It's just what I saw.

910
01:19:06,907 --> 01:19:11,907
Good night, professor.

911
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,457
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:19:16,458 --> 01:19:21,458
The art of Crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

913
01:19:22,047 --> 01:19:25,925
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:19:25,926 --> 01:19:30,346
Now, what do we have here?

915
01:19:30,347 --> 01:19:34,975
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:19:34,976 --> 01:19:39,976
The Grim, possibly.

917
01:19:40,106 --> 01:19:44,360
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

918
01:19:44,361 --> 01:19:48,322
I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

919
01:19:48,323 --> 01:19:52,409
for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

920
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:56,247
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

921
01:19:56,248 --> 01:20:00,417
as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

922
01:20:00,418 --> 01:20:05,418
to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:20:19,062 --> 01:20:24,062
Have I said something?

924
01:20:25,735 --> 01:20:30,735
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

925
01:20:30,907 --> 01:20:33,659
but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,036
Hang on.

927
01:20:36,037 --> 01:20:39,248
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

928
01:20:39,249 --> 01:20:44,249
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

929
01:21:20,415 --> 01:21:25,415
<i>Harry Pattern..</i>

930
01:21:32,594 --> 01:21:37,014
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

931
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:38,849
Sorry?

932
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:43,645
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:21:43,646 --> 01:21:45,856
shall break free.

934
01:21:45,857 --> 01:21:48,275
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

935
01:21:48,276 --> 01:21:53,276
and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:22:00,622 --> 01:22:04,666
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:22:04,667 --> 01:22:06,919
No.

938
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:07,464
Nothing.

939
01:23:01,057 --> 01:23:05,269
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

940
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:08,188
- It just got Worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

941
01:23:08,189 --> 01:23:12,526
I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

942
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:15,195
This is going to be rich.

943
01:23:15,196 --> 01:23:17,531
- Look Who's here.
- Come to see the show?

944
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:20,826
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

945
01:23:20,827 --> 01:23:23,162
Hermione, no!

946
01:23:23,163 --> 01:23:28,163
He's not worth it.

947
01:23:39,512 --> 01:23:41,763
Malfoy, are you okay?

948
01:23:41,764 --> 01:23:46,143
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

949
01:23:46,144 --> 01:23:51,144
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

950
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:14,463
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,924
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:19,510
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

953
01:24:19,511 --> 01:24:22,679
would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

954
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:26,058
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

955
01:24:26,059 --> 01:24:28,268
When it happens.

956
01:24:28,269 --> 01:24:30,604
Great man, Dumbledore.

957
01:24:30,605 --> 01:24:34,608
A great man.

958
01:24:34,609 --> 01:24:37,778
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

959
01:24:37,779 --> 01:24:41,114
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:24:41,115 --> 01:24:46,115
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

961
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:54,753
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:24:54,754 --> 01:24:58,632
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:24:58,633 --> 01:25:02,553
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

964
01:25:02,554 --> 01:25:04,346
I meant me!

965
01:25:04,347 --> 01:25:09,347
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:25:13,022 --> 01:25:16,358
Hagñdl.

967
01:25:16,359 --> 01:25:19,152
Oh, crikey.

968
01:25:19,153 --> 01:25:22,114
No, minister. Over this way.

969
01:25:22,115 --> 01:25:26,368
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:25:26,369 --> 01:25:30,330
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

971
01:25:30,331 --> 01:25:35,331
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:25:35,336 --> 01:25:37,921
Quick. Quick!

973
01:25:37,922 --> 01:25:39,840
Hagñd.

974
01:25:39,841 --> 01:25:44,841
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

975
01:25:45,597 --> 01:25:48,557
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

976
01:25:48,558 --> 01:25:51,393
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:25:51,394 --> 01:25:54,313
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:25:54,314 --> 01:25:59,314
- We'll have a tea, right?
- No, Hagrid.

979
01:26:00,236 --> 01:26:03,030
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

980
01:26:03,031 --> 01:26:07,534
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

981
01:26:07,535 --> 01:26:11,288
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

982
01:26:11,289 --> 01:26:14,625
of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

983
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:19,626
hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:26:20,298 --> 01:26:24,051
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

985
01:26:24,052 --> 01:26:28,597
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

986
01:26:28,598 --> 01:26:30,515
What?

987
01:26:30,516 --> 01:26:32,768
I thought I just saw...

988
01:26:32,769 --> 01:26:37,769
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

989
01:26:39,984 --> 01:26:44,984
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

990
01:27:28,825 --> 01:27:29,325
Oh, no.

991
01:27:41,212 --> 01:27:44,005
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:27:44,006 --> 01:27:46,925
Ron. Ron!

993
01:27:46,926 --> 01:27:51,926
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

994
01:27:51,973 --> 01:27:52,473
Wait!

995
01:27:59,647 --> 01:28:04,109
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harm you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:28:04,110 --> 01:28:09,110
That's not good. Ron, run!

997
01:28:09,532 --> 01:28:12,659
Harry, Hermione, run!

998
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:17,660
It's the Grim!

999
01:28:21,294 --> 01:28:24,546
- Harwl.
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1000
01:28:24,547 --> 01:28:28,133
Harry!

1001
01:28:28,134 --> 01:28:32,637
- Helpl.
- Ronl.

1002
01:28:32,638 --> 01:28:37,638
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1003
01:28:50,740 --> 01:28:54,659
Come on!

1004
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:55,160
Move!

1005
01:29:00,124 --> 01:29:00,624
Duck!

1006
01:29:37,745 --> 01:29:38,245
Harry!

1007
01:29:55,930 --> 01:29:59,099
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1008
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:03,562
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1009
01:30:03,563 --> 01:30:08,563
I just hope I'm wrong.

1010
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:29,004
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1011
01:30:29,005 --> 01:30:29,549
Come on.

1012
01:30:40,975 --> 01:30:42,934
Ron.

1013
01:30:42,935 --> 01:30:45,770
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:30:45,771 --> 01:30:50,771
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1015
01:31:02,872 --> 01:31:05,832
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:07,834
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:31:07,835 --> 01:31:12,835
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:31:15,968 --> 01:31:19,346
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1019
01:31:19,347 --> 01:31:24,347
<i>Expe/liarmus!</i>

1020
01:31:24,894 --> 01:31:29,272
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1021
01:31:29,273 --> 01:31:32,901
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:37,902
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1023
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:48,124
- I found him.
- I know.

1024
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,626
- He's here.
- I understand.

1025
01:31:49,627 --> 01:31:53,254
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1026
01:31:53,255 --> 01:31:57,717
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1027
01:31:57,718 --> 01:32:02,718
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing Classes.

1028
01:32:03,557 --> 01:32:05,767
How long have you known?

1029
01:32:05,768 --> 01:32:09,187
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

1030
01:32:09,188 --> 01:32:12,273
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1031
01:32:12,274 --> 01:32:14,901
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1032
01:32:14,902 --> 01:32:17,696
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1033
01:32:17,697 --> 01:32:20,740
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:25,741
In Azkaban!

1035
01:32:32,586 --> 01:32:34,921
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:32:34,922 --> 01:32:38,842
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:32:38,843 --> 01:32:40,635
I know why.

1038
01:32:40,636 --> 01:32:43,054
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:32:43,055 --> 01:32:46,141
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

1040
01:32:46,142 --> 01:32:48,226
Somebody did betray your parents...

1041
01:32:48,227 --> 01:32:51,938
somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1042
01:32:51,939 --> 01:32:55,567
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:32:55,568 --> 01:32:59,195
And he's in this room! Right now!

1044
01:32:59,196 --> 01:33:02,323
Come out, come out, Peter!

1045
01:33:02,324 --> 01:33:07,324
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expe/liarmus!

1046
01:33:08,289 --> 01:33:10,957
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:33:10,958 --> 01:33:13,376
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:33:13,377 --> 01:33:14,878
Severus...

1049
01:33:14,879 --> 01:33:19,799
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the Castle. Here's the proof.

1050
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,301
Brilliant, Snape.

1051
01:33:21,302 --> 01:33:25,889
You put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:33:25,890 --> 01:33:28,725
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1053
01:33:28,726 --> 01:33:33,726
- ...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1054
01:33:33,898 --> 01:33:36,691
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1055
01:33:36,692 --> 01:33:38,443
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

1056
01:33:38,444 --> 01:33:41,029
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:44,115
Run along and play with
your Chemistry set!

1058
01:33:44,116 --> 01:33:47,077
I could do it, you know.

1059
01:33:47,078 --> 01:33:52,078
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:55,752
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1061
01:33:55,753 --> 01:33:59,422
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1062
01:33:59,423 --> 01:34:04,423
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to Witness, but I'll do my best.

1063
01:34:05,054 --> 01:34:08,348
Severus, please.

1064
01:34:08,349 --> 01:34:13,349
After you.

1065
01:34:14,772 --> 01:34:18,274
<i>Expe/liarmus!</i>

1066
01:34:18,275 --> 01:34:22,070
- Harwl What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:34:22,071 --> 01:34:24,823
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

1068
01:34:24,824 --> 01:34:26,658
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:34:26,659 --> 01:34:29,828
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1070
01:34:29,829 --> 01:34:33,248
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:34:33,249 --> 01:34:36,209
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1072
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:40,672
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1073
01:34:40,673 --> 01:34:45,552
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:34:45,553 --> 01:34:48,847
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1075
01:34:48,848 --> 01:34:51,516
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:34:51,517 --> 01:34:54,269
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1077
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:57,438
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!

1078
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:00,859
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:05,860
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1080
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:09,742
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:35:09,743 --> 01:35:10,994
Scabbers!

1082
01:35:10,995 --> 01:35:15,995
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:35:36,562 --> 01:35:39,147
Remus?

1084
01:35:39,148 --> 01:35:40,815
Sirius.

1085
01:35:40,816 --> 01:35:45,816
My old friends!

1086
01:35:48,365 --> 01:35:52,368
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:35:52,369 --> 01:35:56,873
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:35:56,874 --> 01:35:59,709
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:04,710
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

1090
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:08,134
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the Weapons he possesses!

1091
01:36:08,135 --> 01:36:11,137
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:36:11,138 --> 01:36:16,138
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:36:18,896 --> 01:36:21,481
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:36:21,482 --> 01:36:26,482
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:36:27,655 --> 01:36:32,033
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1096
01:36:32,034 --> 01:36:35,578
No!

1097
01:36:35,579 --> 01:36:39,707
- Harm this man...
- I know what he is.

1098
01:36:39,708 --> 01:36:41,793
But we'll take him to the Castle.

1099
01:36:41,794 --> 01:36:46,794
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1100
01:36:48,008 --> 01:36:50,760
I said we'd take you to the Castle.

1101
01:36:50,761 --> 01:36:55,761
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:36:56,892 --> 01:37:00,812
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:37:00,813 --> 01:37:04,524
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:37:04,525 --> 01:37:06,234
I was going for the rat.

1105
01:37:06,235 --> 01:37:10,238
Normally, I have a very
sweet disposition as a dog.

1106
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:15,239
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:37:15,661 --> 01:37:20,661
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1108
01:37:33,095 --> 01:37:33,595
Okay.

1109
01:37:39,601 --> 01:37:42,312
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1110
01:37:42,313 --> 01:37:44,480
It's fine. I'll stay.

1111
01:37:44,481 --> 01:37:46,774
You go, I'll stay.

1112
01:37:46,775 --> 01:37:51,487
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1113
01:37:51,488 --> 01:37:54,657
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1114
01:37:54,658 --> 01:37:57,702
They might chop it.

1115
01:37:57,703 --> 01:38:00,538
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:38:00,539 --> 01:38:05,539
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:38:06,003 --> 01:38:08,671
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1118
01:38:08,672 --> 01:38:13,134
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1119
01:38:13,135 --> 01:38:18,135
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:38:18,432 --> 01:38:22,060
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:38:22,061 --> 01:38:24,395
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:38:24,396 --> 01:38:27,732
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1123
01:38:27,733 --> 01:38:29,442
to become killers.

1124
01:38:29,443 --> 01:38:33,321
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:38:33,322 --> 01:38:35,865
Alive, you're free.

1126
01:38:35,866 --> 01:38:39,160
Turn me into a slugworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:38:39,161 --> 01:38:42,663
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:38:42,664 --> 01:38:45,333
to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1129
01:38:45,334 --> 01:38:50,334
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1130
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:53,925
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1131
01:38:53,926 --> 01:38:58,179
but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:01,307
I know.

1133
01:39:01,308 --> 01:39:05,520
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1134
01:39:05,521 --> 01:39:08,189
but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1135
01:39:08,190 --> 01:39:11,984
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:39:11,985 --> 01:39:15,321
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1137
01:39:15,322 --> 01:39:15,822
Harry!

1138
01:39:32,339 --> 01:39:37,339
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:42,344
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1140
01:39:44,017 --> 01:39:47,186
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:39:47,187 --> 01:39:52,187
<i>Expe/liarmus!</i>

1142
01:39:59,366 --> 01:40:01,993
Harry!

1143
01:40:01,994 --> 01:40:06,994
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:11,782
Run! Run!

1145
01:40:23,515 --> 01:40:25,725
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1146
01:40:25,726 --> 01:40:30,726
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:40:30,981 --> 01:40:35,981
Professor?

1148
01:40:37,321 --> 01:40:42,321
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:40:46,622 --> 01:40:50,291
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:40:50,292 --> 01:40:55,292
There you are, Potter!

1151
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:28,496
Sirius!

1152
01:41:28,497 --> 01:41:33,497
Come back here, Potter!

1153
01:42:36,732 --> 01:42:38,941
Sirius!

1154
01:42:38,942 --> 01:42:43,942
No. Sirius!

1155
01:43:23,779 --> 01:43:28,779
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1156
01:45:39,706 --> 01:45:42,750
Harry?

1157
01:45:42,751 --> 01:45:45,336
I saw my dad.

1158
01:45:45,337 --> 01:45:47,087
What?

1159
01:45:47,088 --> 01:45:48,798
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:45:48,799 --> 01:45:50,382
I saw him across the lake.

1161
01:45:50,383 --> 01:45:52,259
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1162
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:55,262
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:45:55,263 --> 01:45:57,973
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1164
01:45:57,974 --> 01:45:59,975
Much Worse.

1165
01:45:59,976 --> 01:46:04,063
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:46:04,064 --> 01:46:05,606
Headmaster, stop them.

1167
01:46:05,607 --> 01:46:09,151
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:46:09,152 --> 01:46:11,529
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1169
01:46:11,530 --> 01:46:13,322
He's my rat, sir.

1170
01:46:13,323 --> 01:46:17,326
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1171
01:46:17,327 --> 01:46:21,205
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1172
01:46:21,206 --> 01:46:23,916
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1173
01:46:23,917 --> 01:46:28,917
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:46:32,425 --> 01:46:35,386
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1175
01:46:35,387 --> 01:46:40,387
is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:46:44,354 --> 01:46:48,065
Mysterious thing, time.

1177
01:46:48,066 --> 01:46:49,567
Powerful...

1178
01:46:49,568 --> 01:46:54,029
and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1179
01:46:54,030 --> 01:46:58,450
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:46:58,451 --> 01:47:00,744
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1181
01:47:00,745 --> 01:47:02,705
You must not be seen.

1182
01:47:02,706 --> 01:47:06,542
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:47:06,543 --> 01:47:10,629
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:12,590
If you succeed tonight...

1185
01:47:12,591 --> 01:47:17,261
more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:47:17,262 --> 01:47:22,262
Three turns should do it, I think.

1187
01:47:24,352 --> 01:47:26,353
Oh, and by the way.

1188
01:47:26,354 --> 01:47:31,354
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:34,945
Good luck.

1190
01:47:34,946 --> 01:47:38,073
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:47:38,074 --> 01:47:43,074
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1192
01:48:09,397 --> 01:48:11,190
What just happened?

1193
01:48:11,191 --> 01:48:13,651
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1194
01:48:13,652 --> 01:48:15,694
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:48:15,695 --> 01:48:17,655
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:48:17,656 --> 01:48:21,116
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:48:21,117 --> 01:48:21,729
Hermione!

1198
01:48:41,137 --> 01:48:45,599
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1199
01:48:45,600 --> 01:48:49,395
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:48:49,396 --> 01:48:52,398
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:53,941
That's us.

1202
01:48:53,942 --> 01:48:57,069
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1203
01:48:57,070 --> 01:49:00,823
This is not normal.

1204
01:49:00,824 --> 01:49:03,367
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1205
01:49:03,368 --> 01:49:05,744
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:49:05,745 --> 01:49:09,289
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:49:09,290 --> 01:49:12,668
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1208
01:49:12,669 --> 01:49:17,669
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:49:18,341 --> 01:49:23,341
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:26,140
Good punch.

1211
01:49:26,141 --> 01:49:28,642
Thanks.

1212
01:49:28,643 --> 01:49:31,228
Malfoy's coming.

1213
01:49:31,229 --> 01:49:34,023
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1214
01:49:34,024 --> 01:49:37,276
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:49:37,277 --> 01:49:42,277
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1216
01:49:42,574 --> 01:49:47,574
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1217
01:50:04,304 --> 01:50:08,307
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1218
01:50:08,308 --> 01:50:10,350
Of course.

1219
01:50:10,351 --> 01:50:12,519
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:16,940
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:50:16,941 --> 01:50:17,553
Let's go.

1222
01:50:39,547 --> 01:50:41,840
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:50:41,841 --> 01:50:44,510
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:50:44,511 --> 01:50:48,013
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:50:48,014 --> 01:50:50,557
Scabbers, you're alive!

1226
01:50:50,558 --> 01:50:53,560
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1227
01:50:53,561 --> 01:50:56,647
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:50:56,648 --> 01:51:01,648
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1229
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:06,406
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1230
01:51:06,407 --> 01:51:09,409
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:12,454
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1232
01:51:12,455 --> 01:51:17,455
We can't be seen.

1233
01:51:18,002 --> 01:51:20,629
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:51:20,630 --> 01:51:24,883
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:51:24,884 --> 01:51:29,884
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:51:37,397 --> 01:51:42,397
Are you mad?

1237
01:51:44,946 --> 01:51:46,530
That hurt.

1238
01:51:46,531 --> 01:51:47,031
Sorry.

1239
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:13,720
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:52:28,781 --> 01:52:33,660
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:52:33,661 --> 01:52:35,871
What?

1242
01:52:35,872 --> 01:52:37,915
I thought I just saw...

1243
01:52:37,916 --> 01:52:42,916
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1244
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:59,891
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1245
01:53:03,441 --> 01:53:08,441
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:31,843
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1247
01:53:31,844 --> 01:53:35,222
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1248
01:53:35,223 --> 01:53:40,223
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:53:43,481 --> 01:53:48,481
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1250
01:53:48,569 --> 01:53:53,198
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:53:53,199 --> 01:53:56,868
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1252
01:53:56,869 --> 01:54:01,290
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1253
01:54:01,291 --> 01:54:04,459
Come on. Come on, Buckbeak.

1254
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:09,381
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:54:09,382 --> 01:54:14,094
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1256
01:54:14,095 --> 01:54:15,971
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1257
01:54:15,972 --> 01:54:19,516
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1258
01:54:19,517 --> 01:54:23,186
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:54:23,187 --> 01:54:26,982
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1260
01:54:26,983 --> 01:54:30,027
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1261
01:54:30,028 --> 01:54:31,361
- Over there.
- Where?

1262
01:54:31,362 --> 01:54:33,322
- Over there.
- This way.

1263
01:54:33,323 --> 01:54:37,659
- Let's get this over with.
- All right.

1264
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:40,287
But where is it?

1265
01:54:40,288 --> 01:54:43,123
I saw the beast, just now.

1266
01:54:43,124 --> 01:54:45,500
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1267
01:54:45,501 --> 01:54:47,044
Buckbeak.

1268
01:54:47,045 --> 01:54:51,298
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:54:51,299 --> 01:54:52,841
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1270
01:54:52,842 --> 01:54:57,304
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1271
01:54:57,305 --> 01:55:00,307
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:55:00,308 --> 01:55:02,351
- Right.
- Well, well...

1273
01:55:02,352 --> 01:55:04,061
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:55:04,062 --> 01:55:07,272
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1275
01:55:07,273 --> 01:55:12,273
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:55:12,862 --> 01:55:17,032
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:55:17,033 --> 01:55:19,117
Thank you.

1278
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:24,118
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1279
01:55:33,174 --> 01:55:38,174
- Come on.
- This way.

1280
01:55:41,474 --> 01:55:45,685
This way, now.

1281
01:55:45,686 --> 01:55:47,646
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1282
01:55:47,647 --> 01:55:52,647
- How?
- No idea.

1283
01:55:59,450 --> 01:56:04,450
<i>- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulusl.</i>

1284
01:56:08,251 --> 01:56:13,251
And Snape's coming.

1285
01:56:16,467 --> 01:56:19,344
And now we wait.

1286
01:56:19,345 --> 01:56:24,345
And now we wait.

1287
01:56:48,708 --> 01:56:53,708
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1288
01:56:54,755 --> 01:56:56,715
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1289
01:56:56,716 --> 01:57:01,219
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:57:01,220 --> 01:57:03,513
I did see someone.

1291
01:57:03,514 --> 01:57:07,100
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:57:07,101 --> 01:57:08,602
With a Patronus.

1293
01:57:08,603 --> 01:57:10,687
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:57:10,688 --> 01:57:12,314
According to him...

1295
01:57:12,315 --> 01:57:15,901
only a really powerful Wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:57:15,902 --> 01:57:18,904
It was my dad.

1297
01:57:18,905 --> 01:57:20,864
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:57:20,865 --> 01:57:24,534
- Harm but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1299
01:57:24,535 --> 01:57:29,535
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Here we come.

1301
01:57:38,299 --> 01:57:40,842
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:57:40,843 --> 01:57:43,929
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1303
01:57:43,930 --> 01:57:47,349
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1304
01:57:47,350 --> 01:57:49,643
It'll just be me and him.

1305
01:57:49,644 --> 01:57:51,770
We could live in the country...

1306
01:57:51,771 --> 01:57:54,564
someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:57:54,565 --> 01:57:58,443
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:57:58,444 --> 01:58:01,530
Harry!

1309
01:58:01,531 --> 01:58:02,031
Run!

1310
01:58:10,122 --> 01:58:10,734
Let's go.

1311
01:58:31,227 --> 01:58:36,227
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1312
01:58:37,817 --> 01:58:41,027
Thanks.

1313
01:58:41,028 --> 01:58:46,028
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
02:00:00,191 --> 02:00:02,108
That was so scary.

1315
02:00:02,109 --> 02:00:07,109
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1316
02:00:16,499 --> 02:00:21,499
Sirius. Come on!

1317
02:00:35,643 --> 02:00:37,936
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1318
02:00:37,937 --> 02:00:42,937
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1319
02:00:49,865 --> 02:00:51,908
Any minute now.

1320
02:00:51,909 --> 02:00:55,328
Right there. You'll see.

1321
02:00:55,329 --> 02:00:57,997
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1322
02:00:57,998 --> 02:01:02,998
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1323
02:01:04,672 --> 02:01:09,175
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1324
02:01:09,176 --> 02:01:13,138
both of you.

1325
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:16,766
Harry!

1326
02:01:16,767 --> 02:01:21,767
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1327
02:02:19,246 --> 02:02:20,997
You were right, Hermione.

1328
02:02:20,998 --> 02:02:24,501
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1329
02:02:24,502 --> 02:02:27,420
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
02:02:27,421 --> 02:02:29,964
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1331
02:02:29,965 --> 02:02:31,841
well, I had already done it.

1332
02:02:31,842 --> 02:02:34,469
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1333
02:02:34,470 --> 02:02:39,470
But I don't like flying...!

1334
02:02:50,444 --> 02:02:51,056
<i>Bombarda!</i>

1335
02:03:25,104 --> 02:03:28,064
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1336
02:03:28,065 --> 02:03:29,566
to both of you.

1337
02:03:29,567 --> 02:03:32,652
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1338
02:03:32,653 --> 02:03:35,738
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
02:03:35,739 --> 02:03:38,408
And besides...

1340
02:03:38,409 --> 02:03:41,870
- ...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1341
02:03:41,871 --> 02:03:45,081
And you know it.

1342
02:03:45,082 --> 02:03:49,294
And for now, that will do.

1343
02:03:49,295 --> 02:03:52,839
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1344
02:03:52,840 --> 02:03:57,135
but you look so like your father.

1345
02:03:57,136 --> 02:04:00,054
Except your eyes.

1346
02:04:00,055 --> 02:04:04,309
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1347
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:09,310
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1348
02:04:09,982 --> 02:04:12,609
But know this:

1349
02:04:12,610 --> 02:04:17,155
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
02:04:17,156 --> 02:04:21,492
And you can always find them...

1351
02:04:21,493 --> 02:04:22,037
in here.

1352
02:04:33,756 --> 02:04:38,756
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:08,118
We have to go.

1354
02:05:33,023 --> 02:05:35,858
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1355
02:05:35,859 --> 02:05:37,568
Did What?

1356
02:05:37,569 --> 02:05:42,569
Good night.

1357
02:05:48,288 --> 02:05:49,789
How did you get there?

1358
02:05:49,790 --> 02:05:52,792
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:05:52,793 --> 02:05:55,586
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1360
02:05:55,587 --> 02:06:00,587
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:06:25,617 --> 02:06:30,617
Hello, Harry.

1362
02:06:30,748 --> 02:06:35,748
I saw you coming.

1363
02:06:37,129 --> 02:06:42,129
I've looked worse, believe me.

1364
02:06:42,551 --> 02:06:45,887
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1365
02:06:45,888 --> 02:06:49,015
No. I resigned, actually.

1366
02:06:49,016 --> 02:06:50,975
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:06:50,976 --> 02:06:55,976
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:01,440
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1369
02:07:02,112 --> 02:07:05,698
well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:07:05,699 --> 02:07:07,784
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...

1371
02:07:07,785 --> 02:07:09,827
risked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:07:09,828 --> 02:07:13,706
Besides, people like me are...

1373
02:07:13,707 --> 02:07:18,707
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1374
02:07:26,595 --> 02:07:29,347
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1375
02:07:29,348 --> 02:07:31,682
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:07:31,683 --> 02:07:35,394
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1377
02:07:35,395 --> 02:07:39,065
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1378
02:07:39,066 --> 02:07:41,943
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:07:41,944 --> 02:07:46,944
It made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:07:49,076 --> 02:07:51,452
If I am proud of anything...

1381
02:07:51,453 --> 02:07:54,288
it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:07:54,289 --> 02:07:57,208
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1383
02:07:57,209 --> 02:08:02,209
I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:08:02,381 --> 02:08:05,049
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1385
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:08,177
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:08:08,178 --> 02:08:10,847
Until then...

1387
02:08:10,848 --> 02:08:15,848
mischief managed.

1388
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:51,179
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:08:51,180 --> 02:08:53,431
Harry.

1390
02:08:53,432 --> 02:08:54,974
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:08:54,975 --> 02:08:57,560
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1392
02:08:57,561 --> 02:08:59,896
- What are you talking about?
- QuieL.

1393
02:08:59,897 --> 02:09:03,357
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1394
02:09:03,358 --> 02:09:06,027
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:09:06,028 --> 02:09:08,905
Did not.

1396
02:09:08,906 --> 02:09:12,575
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:09:12,576 --> 02:09:14,285
For me?

1398
02:09:14,286 --> 02:09:16,996
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1399
02:09:16,997 --> 02:09:21,997
This came with it.

1400
02:09:23,754 --> 02:09:25,588
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1401
02:09:25,589 --> 02:09:30,589
How fast is it, Harry?

1402
02:09:47,361 --> 02:09:48,569
Lumos.

1403
02:09:48,570 --> 02:09:53,570
<i>I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.</i>

1404
02:21:10,168 --> 02:21:15,168
<i>Mischief managed.</i>

1405
02:21:17,717 --> 02:21:18,217
<i>Nox.</i>

1406
02:21:18,717 --> 02:21:38,217
