[cell phone rings and buzzes]

00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,440
MOMMY: Come home.
GUZMÁN: Where are you?

-[cameras clicking]

6
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,680
Excuse me.

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,920
Darling.

8
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,520
Everything is going to be fine. All right?

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,960
[police siren wails]

00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,640
[music playing]

11
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,440
All three people responsible
for the construction company are accused

12
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,240
of alleged embezzlement of public funds,

13
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,120
bribery, and criminal negligence.

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,960
Shit, poor people.

15
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,880
[Nano] That's us. At least I stole to eat,
unlike these rich people.

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,760
I meant their families.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,600
But, of course,

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
you wouldn't understand that, huh?

19
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,640
Always a mean comment.

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,960
-[mother] Have you talked to Marina?
-No.

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,960
You should talk to her.
She must be having a terrible time.

22
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
Poor girl.

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,680
[school bell ringing]

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,600
-Hello.
-Hello.

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,440
-[Polo] Don't worry, man.
-[Lu] Really, don't.

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
It's okay.

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,800
It's pre-trial detention.
We pay bail and he's released.

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,920
-[Lu] And how much is it?
-Three hundred thousand.

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,440
-We'll pay this afternoon.
-And the trial?

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,400
It doesn't matter. They have nothing.

31
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,640
-Then why have they accused him?
-I don't know, Ander. Shit, I don't know!

32
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,360
Some judge wanted to be on the news,
no fucking idea!

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,240
[students chattering]

34
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,560
They have nothing against him, okay?
They have no proof.

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
That's what your father says, Carla.

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,880
[Polo] Come on,
we come in peace, Christian.

37
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,320
Yeah, being called a thief
makes me feel totally well.

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,000
[Polo] We're saying that if it was you
who took the watches, we don't care.

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,080
You return them, and we forget about it.

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,160
How can I forget something
I know nothing about?

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,880
How are you?

42
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Not well, I'm not gonna lie to you.

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,760
Samuel, I don't want to talk now.

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,160
Christian, we only care about one watch.
The one with a red leather strap.

45
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,800
It was my grandfather's,
he died last Christmas.

46
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,160
-My father is very attached to it.
-Can you listen to me?

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,600
Yes.

48
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,160
Sorry. Um...

49
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,680
-Do you want to talk later?
-Whenever you want.

50
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,880
If it shows up tomorrow in my desk,
we'll forget about it, really.

51
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,480
Enough already. Why me?
Am I the only one who's been there?

52
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,640
-No, but you're the only one--
-Without a penny to his name, right?

53
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,480
-And that's enough to make me a thief!
-Christian, I didn't say that.

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
[Christian] We all know
rich people don't steal.

55
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
[Polo] Christian, when have I said that?

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,480
Carla, are you all right?

57
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,480
What is it? As far as I know,
your grandfather isn't dead.

58
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,000
How much did you hear?

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
[students chattering]

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
[Marina sighs]

61
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,640
All of it.

62
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,480
Except why that watch is so important.

63
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,680
It's a pen drive, with documents.
Don't tell your brother, okay?

64
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,800
Papers from the business
my father and yours have.

65
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,360
If they were to fall
into the wrong hands right now...

MARINA: <i>Don't give them the watch</i>

[car honks]

72
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,920
What are you doing?

73
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,960
Reading comments.

74
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,080
Babe, that's the first thing
you should stop doing. Okay?

75
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,080
Hey.

76
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
What's up with you?

77
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,840
Does your religion not allow you
to console your friends?

78
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,200
Or maybe you can't forgive him
for sleeping with me again.

79
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,160
[sighing] Really!

80
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,920
I don't care about what you two have.

81
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,160
My dear...

82
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,880
Now that you have taken the veil off
your head, you should consider...

83
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,680
removing that blindfold.

84
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,000
-Guzmán and I--
-Let's see if you understand.

85
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,200
The only man
I'm interested in right now...

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,400
is called Dostoyevsky.

87
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,440
But, of course, every time there's a man,
even if he's been dead for a century,

88
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,920
you can't help getting in the middle, huh?

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,440
He died in 1881, he's been dead 137 years.

90
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
You've convinced me. It's obvious
you don't give a shit about Guzmán.

91

[piano playing]

92
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,440
<i>Omar, can you come to the school?</i>

93
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,560
Give me a moment, man.

94
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,080
Hey! What are you doing here?

95
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Are you stupid?

96
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,720
-Hi, by the way.
-Do you know who Marina's brother is?

97
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,920
Do you know what he's capable
of doing if he finds out?

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,840
-I don't care, I need the money.
-Omar. What for? What do you want?

99
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,880
-What do you care?
-I care about you. Idiot!

100
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,120
I don't want you to...

101
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,720
to end in jail or worse
for a pair of sneakers, or a motorbike.

102
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,760
I already live in a fucking jail.

103
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,960
This! This dough will set me free.
I need it to leave home.

104
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,040
Do you understand now?

105
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,080
-Omar.
-Let go.

106
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,320
Omar!

107
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,680
Marina.

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,160
I wanted to talk to you.

109
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,200
-Sure.
-How are you?

110
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,960
Fine. Well, better.

111
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,080
I'm glad.

112
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,680
I just wanted to tell you that we are here
for anything you need.

113
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,200
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

114
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,200
Now it's exam time,
we'll do everything we can--

115
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
-[retching]
-Oh, dear!

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,880
-Do you have a handkerchief here?
-No!

117
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
[Marina panting]

118
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,720
Open your locker, Marina.

119
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,640
-I'll have to talk to your mother.
-No.

120
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,800
She can't deal with another problem.

121
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,040
I don't know. We've all fucked up
at some point, right?

122
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,520
It would be a shame if, for one mistake,
no matter how big,

123
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,560
everything went to hell, right, Martín?

124
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Um...

125
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,960
Let's see,
Marina is an exemplary student, Azucena.

126
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,280
And we should consider
the circumstances, right?

127
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,000
This could stay between us.

128
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,880
But it can't happen again.

129
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,240
Okay, but to ensure that,
we need to nip it in the bud.

130
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,280
-Who sold it to you?
-What?

131
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,280
Your dealer. The one who didn't hesitate
to sell drugs to a minor at her school.

132
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,880
I don't know, he never mentioned his name.

133
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,760
You have his number on your cell.
Didn't you text him to meet?

134
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,840
Your phone.

135
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,200
NANO: <i>I didn't give it to them.</i>

136
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,200
-No.
-Marina, this is serious.

137
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,440
I only need a name.

138
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,520
Marina, give me the phone! Marina!

139
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,800
-I can't.
-Give it to me!

140
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,040
I'll give you a name, but,
please, don't report him.

141
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,360
Give me the phone.

142
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Omar!

143
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
His name is Omar, he's Nadia's brother.

144
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,360
I think this is all getting
a bit out of control.

145
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,760
I can't have a student blackmailing me
whenever she pleases.

146
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,560
I can't jeopardize my job.

147
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,920
-I can't, I'm sorry.
-Of course. What a pity.

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,200
Too late.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
The stork is on its way. [chuckles]

150
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,400
Of course, you're worried about Marina.

151
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,480
Don't worry, she will not talk.

152
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,840
If she does, let me remind you
that you and I

153
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,120
are on this boat together,
and will go down together.

154
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,360
[chuckles]
Besides, do you think I will let her talk?

155
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,680
You have everything
you could wish to be happy.

156
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why get in a mess like this
for a shitty trophy,

157
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,280
and a scholarship you don't need?
I don't understand you.

Excuse me?

160
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,920
Because I always see myself fat.

Do you know why I'm the best?

Because I'm never satisfied.

We caught Marina with marijuana
that this Omar sold her.

He's Nadia's brother.

it would never be
by extorting my family and their friends.

Is that how you want to start a new life?

No, I told you,
I want a fresh start, with you.

-I won't tell Samuel the truth.

-Son of a bitch!

632
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,880
Good morning.

633
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,200
Um...

634
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,360
I've called the agency
and cancelled the adoption.

635
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,800
-[students chattering]
-[Martin clears throat]

636
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,080
-What did your wife say?
-She agrees, what else could she say?

637
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,120
I see.

638
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,000
What values would we be teaching our child
if we got it by cheating?

639
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,200
What kind of parents would we have been?

640
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,040
I think we'll never know.

641
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,240
Hey.

642
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,240
Shouldn't you be studying?

643
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,960
We were at his mother's studio,
and he starts kissing me on the neck,

644
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,760
then unbuttons my shirt,
takes my belt off and grabs my dick.

645
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,560
-[Samu] Really?
-[Nadia] Sure.

646
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,240
Omar told me.

647
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,200
Marina got caught,
and then gave him away, yes.

648
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,040
I guess to save herself.

649
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
-[drops books on table]
-[sighs]

650
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,280
-She hasn't told you either?
-Me? She's driving me crazy.

651
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,960
-She's made me doubt even my brother.
-What? But why?

652
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,280
I'll tell you later.

653
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,080
-How do you feel about the exam?
-What does it matter?

654
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,200
What do you mean, and the scholarship?

655
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,160
[sighs] They can't give it to me
if I'm not from this school.

656
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,920
And it was hard to get my father
to let me finish the school year.

657
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Nadia, what happened?

658
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
[Guzman sighs]

659
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,600
[Martin] Hello, everybody.

660
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,920
So, the day is finally here.
Pens only on your desks, please.

661
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,680
-Done.
-Finished?

662
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,760
-Sure?
-Yes.

663
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,400
Guys, keep working in silence,
and nobody move, please!

664
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,480
Marina!

665
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,640
Marina, what is it?

666
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,640
Nothing.

667
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,520
-Not nothing, what's this?
-Nothing, I don't know it, that's all.

668
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
Samuel, what are you doing?

669
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,920
I want to assure you
there won't be any favoritism.

670
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,920
-Is it about our issue?
-Martín, I just want to go home.

671
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,680
I want to settle this problem, okay?

672
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,000
-What? Son of a bitch.
-Have you told him?

673
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,040
-Son of a bitch!
-What are you doing?

674
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,880
[all yelling]

675
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,520
The son of a bitch took advantage
of her and got her pregnant!

676
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,640
-What?
-What?

677
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,080
-Martín?
-Azucena, do you think I'd do that?

678
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,760
And accepting a bribe, that you would do?

679
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,640
My office.

680
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,960
Fuck!

681
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,880
Bribe him, me? Please!

682
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,440
How can she invent such a fantasy?

683
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,840
It was you who told me.

684
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,280
Really, she's crazier
than she already was.

685
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,000
It's her word against mine. [laughs]

686
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,280
-I mean, with this girl's history--
-Marina is telling the truth.

687
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,480
Excuse me?

688
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,440
We made a deal,
but today I told Lucrecia that--

689
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,720
You're fired, Martín.

690
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,400
Don't make it any harder.
We'll send your belongings home.

691
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,960
Fine.

692
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,280
[door slams]

693
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,240
It's very clear that I had
nothing to do with this, right? That...

694
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,400
That I didn't do anything.

695
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,480
Your denial only insults my intelligence.

696
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,720
And earns you two months of suspension
instead of one.

697
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,000
-We are in the middle of exams.
-You will sit your exams in September.

698
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,400
[school bell rings]

699
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,160
[pencils and pens clink]

700
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,960
-How did you do in the exam?
-Good.

701
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,560
[zips and drops case]

702
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,480
We changed plans
at the last minute, really.

703
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,800
I didn't want to bother you
while you were studying.

704
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,000
Thank you for not telling me you were
fucking someone else so I'd stay focused.

705
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,120
Hey, you fucked him too, okay?

706
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,200
Okay, I'm sorry.

707
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,680
Always with you.
That was the deal. To share everything.

708
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,360
Carla, really, it was nothing.

709
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,360
It was nothing!

710
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,680
Come, give me a hug.

711
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,960
-Carla, I didn't even like it.
-This...

712
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,920
was something we did to avoid infidelity,

713
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,280
lies.

714
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:32,720
To revive a relationship that was dead.

715
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,320
[sighs] But given all this,

716
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,680
it's better it stay buried.

717
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,840
[door bells jingle]

718
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,440
-Hello.
-Hi.

719
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,320
[Yusef humming to himself]

720
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,320
-Let's go.
-No.

721
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,120
One fifty, please.

722
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,440
[cash register chimes]

723
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,080
I need change.

724
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,640
Why don't you answer my messages?

725
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,040
-Don't have a cell anymore.
-When can we meet?

726
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,960
I'll be behind this counter for two years.

727
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,440
-Omar.
-What are you doing?

728
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,760
Thanks.

729
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,560
[Yusef continues humming]

730
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,560
Omar, please.

731
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,920
Please.

732
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:49,880
I can't.

733
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,160
Have a good day.

734
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,960
Bye.

735
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
[door bells jingle]

736
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,360
Do you want to know whose it is?

737
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,560
-Do you really need to know?
-No. Marina.

738
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,040
Enough.

739
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,320
I'm tired.

740
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,240
I'm tired of chasing after you.

741
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,920
-Samuel, maybe--
-Listen to me! Please.

742
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,880
I'm tired of trying all the time
to convince you about us.

743
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,040
But most of all, I'm tired
of waiting for you to find...

744
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,840
the fucking courage to break up with me!

745
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,640
Samuel.

746
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,960
How would you have reacted
if she had decided to end it with you?

747
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,080
[sighs]
I don't know, because that never happened.

748
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,040
I have never seen this message.

749
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,840
She wrote it.

750
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,640
She never hit the send button.

751
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,160
Read it, please.

752
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,040
"Nano,

753
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,400
forgive me,

754
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,640
but I can't do this.

755
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,560
I can't leave, I'm sorry."

756
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,680
Why didn't she tell you in person?

757
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,640
Was she afraid you might react violently?

758
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,840
Still thinking about the blackmail idea?

759
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,360
[sighs]

760
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,160
I'm not sure.

761
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,720
What are you thinking?

762
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,440
Let's go get them.
