All set.

Here you go.

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,760
"Partey," with "E-Y"? Really?

That's the way they say it.

00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,720
Quit stalling and create the event.

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,000
When will your mom be absent again
on a Saturday night?

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,560
-Who are all these people?
-They are my friends.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
[Samu] You still haven't told me
where you know them from.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,560
You're not the only one

-[Nano] Okay.
-[Samu] Idiot.

[Samu] We'll have people at home
whom we don't know. You're irresponsible.

That above all else.
But I know you well, Samu.

You only care
about that posh girl coming.

00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,320
That's why you're organizing this circus.

I won't end up like your sister!

33

She was drugged and taken advantage of,
but no one is going to do that to me!

A week ago I went to the agency.
I wanted to know how they were.

37
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,160
Apparently, I was ten years too late.

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,720
They overdosed.

That shit ruins your life, man.
I can't let anything happen to you.

You're my friend.

Why did you never tell me this?

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,000
Because...
you and I talk about other things.

43
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,840
We talk about cars, girls, parties,
but not that.

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,320
Maybe we should, right?

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,680
Yes.

46

If you want we can do a kebab-cinema,
like in the old days.

47

I'd like that, but I'm still grounded.

Because of you.

You were outswam

-It looks that way.

-That's what you were going to do.

Fuck her, to then expose her.

He's had it in for me since day one.

Besides, I wouldn't tell on you,
you are my buddy.

In fact, you're the only friend
I have here!

As your lawyer, I advise you
to stop talking to the police.

-I have nothing to confess.

You were covered in the victim's blood.
A victim you knew very well.

With whom,
you were seen having an argument.

Look, Samuel,
maybe it's not what it looks like...

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
but I doubt any judge will believe you.

right before I got there?

Get the fucking documents.

I know the combination to the safe,
so I get them...

hand them over, so they can squeeze more
dough from the contractor than I owe...

Don't get me wrong. If I were a chick,
I'd be all over you, no doubt, man.

I'd fuck you dry,
make you quadruplets, at least.

But I don't know,
there's no accounting for taste, Nano.

Maybe this chick is not into good ham,
and prefers some bland turkey breast.

You ask him. He's not talking to me.

Same thing?

Let me get this straight. He brings
that troglodyte into your relationship,

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,160
then he freaks out, makes a scene,
and punishes you with silence?

142
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,920
Sure, next he's going to expect you to get
on your knees and beg for forgiveness.

143
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,880
And as usual, you'll do it.

Why are you mad at me too?

145

Because I can't stand it
when he walks all over you.

00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,920
Pass.

637
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,000
If they want
to spice up their relationship,

638
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,480
-they should find somebody else.
-[both laughing]

639
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,640
Do you know why they need
to spice up their relationship?

640
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,920
Because it's bland, Christian.

641
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,760
That's why they are looking
for a good stud. Listen...

642
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,360
The more she can compare...

643
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,000
the more she'll realize that what she has
at home looks expensive,

644
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,200
but is just a cheap plastic trinket.

645
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,400
[Christian laughs]

646
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,040
-So what are you telling me?
-Don't be stupid.

647
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,600
That guy is allowing you to steal
his girlfriend right under his nose.

648
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,240
You can't pass on that.

649
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,360
I won't.

650
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,600
Attaboy.

651
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,120
[puffs]

652
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
You can't be doing this to me, Carla!

653
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,280
What do you mean you have plans
or something else to do?

654
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,400
Do you think I'm stupid?

655
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:45,840
Why don't you just tell me you have a date
with this fucking influencer?

656
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,280
You know what?

657
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,920
I pity you, for letting people
boss you around like this.

658
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,040
And for having such low self-esteem...

659
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,240
dear.

660
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,320
Stop treating me as an abused woman, OK?

661
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,320
You pose as a liberal, and say you do
what you want with men,

662
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,280
but the only reason you accepted being
Guzmán's friend with benefits

663
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,520
is that he didn't want anything serious,
and you wanted him really bad.

664
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,000
[beeps]

665
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,000
Oh, sorry.

666
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,840
I was just putting my ovaries
on the table.

667
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,280
Hello.

668
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,200
Son of a bitch!

669
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,040
And this shack?

670
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,320
It's beautiful!

671
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,160
Is this yours?

672
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,080
Our parents bought it for us,
and we are furnishing it little by little.

673
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,440
We got the bed last Friday.

674
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,160
Great.

675
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,200
[Carla chuckles]

676
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,280
Christian, do you like fish?

677
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,160
Is that a trick question?

678
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,800
We are about to order dinner,
and wanted you to join us.

679
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,680
-Besides, I think we owe you that.
-Okay.

680
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,240
Listen...

681
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,160
The neighbor who called the cops told mom.
So we are in trouble.

682
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,600
What's the matter?

683
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,040
Marina.

684
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,680
What's the matter with Marina?

685
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,280
She's HIV-positive, Nano.

686
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,320
And that's not the worst part.

687
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,800
The worst is I just stood there
and didn't know what to say.

688
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,760
Instead of telling her I don't care.

689
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,800
Besides, nowadays it's not a problem.
I've been reading up online,

690
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,840
and nowadays it's no big deal
to be HIV-positive.

691
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,280
Instead, I just stood there
and stared like an idiot.

692
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
We have it all planned. All of it.

693
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,160
Even our retirement.

694
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,600
-Sometimes we worry too much, right?
-Yeah.

695
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,080
That's why we decided to add some...

696
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,160
-spice to our lives.
-And that would be me, right?

697
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,200
The spice.

698
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,240
Which one am I?
Pepper, cayenne, hot chili?

699
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,800
Forgive us, really.

700
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,800
But... it wasn't so horrible, right?
At least I hope so.

701
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,000
Didn't you have a good time?

702
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,160
I did.

703
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,960
Would you like to do it again?

704
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Mwah!

705
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,480
Have you ever been in a threesome?

706
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,080
[Carla moans]

707
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,520
[they all chuckle]

708
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,920
I love you more than ever.

709
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,840
I love you more than ever.

710
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,120
He told you, right?

711
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,280
I'm medicated. It's undetectable.

712
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,680
That means I can't infect you.

713
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
[Nano huffs]

714
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,240
I don't care that you didn't tell me.

715
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,200
But you kept quiet
because you were afraid I'd bolt.

716
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,040
It's not a problem, it's normal.

717
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,280
But you told Samu precisely for that,
to scare him away.

718
00:49:58,080 --> 00:49:59,880
-Maybe.
-Marina, please.

719
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,760
You don't know him. You won't be able to.

720
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,120
He'll research the subject,
and tomorrow he'll know more than you.

721
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,640
Why are you here?

722
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,320
Shit.

723
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,480
Stop toying with my brother,
and tell him the fucking truth.

724
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,920
That you don't like him.

725
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,760
I'm not toying with him.

726
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,240
-I feel something, but...
-Yeah.

727
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,520
Like with me the other night.

728
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,840
No way. That is easy to see.

729
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,800
I also saw that you felt something too.

730
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:34,840
Or didn't you?

731
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:36,840
Come on.

732
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:39,480
Truth.

733
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,480
This isn't a fucking game!

734
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,960
<i>[policewoman]</i>
<i>Did you know she was pregnant?</i>

735
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,880
If I knew?

736
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,400
Whose baby do you think that was?

737
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:03,240
Why do you think
we were going to run away together?

738
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,200
I went to school to pick her up...

739
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,920
I found her like that.

740
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,440
We wanted to get as far
as we could from here.

741
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,760
Do you know who couldn't stand the idea?

742
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,120
Your fucking witness.

743
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,240
Are you...

744
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,640
suggesting...

745
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,080
that your brother killed her?
