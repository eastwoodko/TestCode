-Fuck you.

160
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,080
I fucked you to steal at your place.
To keep you away from my brother.

161
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,040
To prove him you're a rich girl
who has a crash on jerks.

162
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,880
That's why I fucked you.

What?

[birds chirping]

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,960
And now I cannot get you out
of my fucking head.

166
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,680
But you're with my brother,
that's what you both deserve.

167
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,400
Did you come to save me?
There's nothing left to save.

168
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,400
Nano, I want to help you.

169
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,440
Don't ask me why, but I couldn't bear
if something bad happened to you.

170
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Look.

171
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,440
My father's partner has
an amazing watch collection.

172
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,240
And that asshole deserves way more
to be robbed than my family.

173
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,680
I guess that with 4 or 5 watches
you'd settle the debt.

What do you think?

I have to go back to work.

Listen, I'm fucked up since I told you
that we tried to steal at your place.

177
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,560
I'd totally understand if you don't want
to have anything to do with me.

Are you sure? I was freaking out.
Are we okay?

We are better than okay.

to go one step further, don't you think?

every four months and...

311
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,680
The virus I have isn't detectable
in the blood, so...

312
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,640
That means that you can't get infected.

313
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,000
Thanks, Marina.

314
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
It takes a lot of courage to share this.

315
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,160
Don't you think, Nadia?

316
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,320
I'd rather not comment.

[Ander] Here you have, man.

00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
It was Pablo who infected her, right?

321
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,200
What? What did I miss?

322
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,520
Did you know it?

323
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,920
-Did you tell him and not to me?
-He told me when he was really down.

324
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
-And because I was there.
-Yeah.

325
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,800
That's why you can't stand the new guys?

326
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,240
These people
never bring anything good, Polo.

327
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,640
You can't judge all of them
for one single individual.

328
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,920
Polo, say what you want.

329
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,880
But Christian has already started
to take advantage and won't stop.

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,120
Those people have a plan to take profit.
And they know how to go with it.

331
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,720
-What? What are you talking about?
-Do you tell him or should I?

332
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,320
What?

333
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,360
Polo and Carla are experimenting
with Christian,

334
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,800
and I keep telling him the risks,
but he won't listen to me.

335
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,880
I knew that already.
He told me himself in Samuel's party.

336
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,080
-Why would he tell you in the party?
-See?

337
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,640
For fuck's sake.

338
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,760
He's telling everyone because he wants
to take profit. He wants to fuck you.

339
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,720
Nobody will use me.

340
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
He won't use me.

341
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
When we were little, we were good friends.

342
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,120
Hi.

343
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,400
-Can I take a seat?
-Sure, you silly.

344
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,400
But then we drifted apart
and we barely spoke.

345
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,480
How're you doing?

346
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,720
-You know...
-I really think you were brave.

347
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,400
And I'm sorry you had to go
through all this by yourself.

348
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,800
Don't worry. I had Guzmán and my parents.

349
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,600
Besides, it's been a long time
since we were BF, so...

350
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,320
But you can count on me for anything.
You know it, right?

351
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,880
Didn't you notice any changes,
anything unusual?

352
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,160
Damn, I'd love to have a friend.

353

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,080
I do understand you.

357
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,640
Would you like to meet later?

-Sure. At my place, great.

What are you doing here?

I couldn't stand any more pity faces,
or condescending looks.

366

Did you see how Nadia stared at me?
I had a friend, and I already lost her.

367
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,800
I'm really sorry.

368
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,200
You had to explain it in front of everyone
because of me.

369
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,320
It had to happen sooner or later.

[striking tennis ball]

Do you know when you think that...

373
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,360
you're brave, but the truth is
that your life is full of cowardly acts?

374
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,680
Talking in front of the class as you did
is not a coward thing to do.

375
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,000
Samuel, I'm only brave when I'm forced to.

376
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,320
So in the end, I have to thank you.

377
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,800
And... are you really afraid
of been with me for having HIV?

378
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,120
That doesn't scare me at all, okay?

-Wait for me. I finish in five minutes.
-Okay.

629
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,240
See you in a bit.

630

[birds tweeting]

631
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,440
[Ander] Omar, let's talk about it.

632
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,560
Why the fuck have you talked about us?

633
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,200
No, no. Besides,
when did you made up that story, man?

634
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,840
-They're my friends.
-We're not together.

635
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,600
It's not happening, Ander.
Not now, not ever.

636
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,280
I don't get why you're acting like this.

637
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,720
Because I can't.

638
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,160
Too many people knows it.
Even my sister, man.

639
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,720
And you don't know my family.
If they knew, I'd break their heart.

640
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,920
I thought nobody dies from a broken heart.

641
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,520
Hi. Eh... Omar, right?

642
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,920
-Yes.
-Can you sell me something?

643
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,760
We may need it.

644
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,440
How much?

645
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,160
It's on the house.

646
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,920
But be careful with it. It's really strong
and we don't want you to get sick.

647
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,080
Thanks.

648
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,680
Everything okay?

649
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,000
Yes.

What do you think?
The lights are too much?

655
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,280
No, it's cool.

656
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,160
I've got pot. You want some?

657
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,920
-No, we're fine.
-Okay.

-Samuel...
-What?

661
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,080
Slowly.

662
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,000
Okay.

663

[Marina moans]

664
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,640
Fuck!

665
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,200
[Marina] What? Just relax.

666
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,200
[Samu huffs] I can't...

667
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,960
I'm fucking it.

668
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,680
-I'm fucking it.
-Lay down.

669
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,560
Samuel.

670
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,960
Yes.

671
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,520
I want to love you.

[both moaning and panting]

673
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,200
[Samu panting] Sorry.

674
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,520
Sorry.

675
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Sorry. [sighs]

676
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,160
I wasn't so bad, don't you think?

677
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
[Marina] No. You were fine.

678
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,560
[Marina] Great.

679
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,840
Samuel, I should leave soon.

680
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,840
My mum works tonight.

681
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,600
I know,
but they're expecting me for dinner.

682
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,680
Don't freak out, but someone broke in.
They took the watches and...

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800
[takes a deep breath]

684
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,120
They took mine, too.

685
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,920
Yes, everything is in there.

686
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,520
-[Samu] What's all this?
-I have enough to pay everything.

687
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,720
Where did you get them, Nano?

688
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,120
-Marina helped me to open a little door.
-What?

689
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,560
Why did you drag her into your problems?

690
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,160
Fuck! Why does she get into this?

691
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,680
Because she loves you. Why else?

692
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,800
I'm telling you. She'll be fine.

693
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,480
So be happy for me, because I'm fucking
settling everything with this, Samu.

694
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,120
Pun intended.

695
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,520
This is for you.

696
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,920
-Put it away.
-It smells wealthy.

697
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,320
-Put it away!
-Okay.

00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,440

Hi, Guzmán.

709
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,960
Hi.

710
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,200
How is your sister?

711
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,880
She didn't come to the first hour.

712
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,840
I guess she overslept, not sure.

713
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,200
Look at that.

714
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,760
Mwah!

715
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,880
[Lu]
You were great at your pool last night.

716
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,440
Sometimes I forget
how good we're in bed.

717
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,520
That's why you did it,
to tell everyone, right?

718
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,280
-You don't surprise me anymore, Lu.
-Was it a secret?

719
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,800
Well, I thought there weren't secrets
between friends.

720
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,760
Anyway, see you later.

721
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,400
Nadia.

722
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,280
-Don't worry.
-It was nothing.

723
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,600
-Are you alone with this?
-Yes.

724
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,720
Hi.

725
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,880
I called you three times.
My name wasn't in the casting list.

726
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,480
Ah, eh...

727
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,080
In the end, it wasn't possible.
My mum wasn't sure about you. Sorry.

728
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,160
Yeah, fucking great.

729
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,920
You fucked him like this?

730
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,560
What?

731
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,400
What happens? I don't owe him anything.
Besides, I'm fed up of being used by him.

732
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,320
He only wants us to his advantage.

733
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,120
We're not taking advantage
from him, right?

734
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,720
What's really annoying you?

735
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,360
He only wants us for one thing.

736
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,280
Yes.

737
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,280
-In fact, he only wants you.
-You're jealous.

738
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,600
What're you saying?

739
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:30,520
[Samu] Marina.

740
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,480
How're you doing?
I kept calling you last night.

741
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,400
I called you first thing in the morning,
too. Everything okay?

742
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,080
Yes, I was quite tired, and my phone died.

743
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,720
Sure.

744
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,880
Sure what, Samuel?

745
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
You don't believe me?

746
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,040
No, it's not that I don't believe you.
I have the impression you're avoiding me.

747
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,040
Don't get paranoid, Samuel.

748
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,200
Paranoid about what?

749
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Paranoid about what?

750
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,360
I'm starting to feel like a jerk.

751
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,440
If something is going on, don't lie to me.
The only thing I can't stand are lies.

752
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,080
That's the only thing you can't stand?

753
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,360
Lies?

754
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,400
Fuck, you can't stand much.

755
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,800
Because lies are told to make life easier.

756
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,680
To avoid hurting, to avoid suffering.
So you don't hurt anyone.

757
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,640
-Leave it, Samu.
-I'm not sure... Marina!

Marina, are you okay?

766

-Fuck!
-Why did you argue?

767
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,880
I'd never been close to anyone with HIV.

768

Marina...

769
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,240
[Carla] Marina. What happened?
What're you doing, go get help!

770
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,520
Marina. Marina, look at me.

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,600
Look at me, look at me!

773
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,040
[Martin] Come on, leave me.

774
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,640
Can you hear me? Look at me.

775
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,120
Look at me. Follow my finger, please.

776

Fuck, look at those pupils. Damn it.

778
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,800
What did you take, Marina?
What did you take?

779
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,440
What happened with Marina?

780
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,440
Do you know this is immediate expulsion?

781

Marina. Fuck's sake!

-I don't want.
-I'm taking you to the infirmary.

-I don't want.
-Yes, I'm taking you there.

784
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,200
[Marina] I'm fine. I'm perfectly fine.
[tries to stand but falls]

785
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,720
Are you sure you didn't have a personal
relationship with Marina beyond the class?

786
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,760
No, of course not.

787
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,200
I'm taking her to the hospital.
Notify the secretariat.

-Let's go.
-[Marina] Martín, no. I don't want to.
