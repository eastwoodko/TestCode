1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,800
So, according to you...

2
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,040
everything started
with the arrival of the new students.

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,240
When a new species is introduced
in an ecosystem, it is always altered.

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,720
[Lu] <i>The new one can devastate</i>
<i>the flora and fauna of a place,</i>

6
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,080
<i>or cause more subtle changes</i>
<i>which end up perverting everything.</i>

00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,640
[policewoman] <i>Are you referring</i>
<i>to the scholarship students</i>

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,960
<i>as if they were another species?</i>

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,640
I'm trying to think that Marina is not...

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,720
is not dead.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,400
Social networks are the way
we have nowadays

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,400
to present ourselves to the rest, right?

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,680
What we show, or what we hide,

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,720
says a lot about who we are.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,160
And this is what the pair work
I want you to do is about.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,040
I want you to create...

17
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,480
your partner's profile
for a social network.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,520
But wasn't this a language
and literature class?

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,320
Welcome to Las Encinas, man.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,880
We can demonize social networks,
like other schools do, but...

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,080
but we can also use them to learn.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,400
Please, take advantage of the opportunity
to investigate, to question the other.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,480
And most of all, adapt this to your goal.
What is it, Christian?

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,320
I just have a doubt.
What can I improve in my profile? Nothing!

25
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,720
-It's perfect!
-[Lu] Believe me, it can be improved.

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,200
Martín was talking about privilege
and intelligence, not you.

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,840
Boom! Take that.

28
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,920
[Martin] Guys...

29
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,600
Please, be creative.

30
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,160
Use photos, video, interviews,
whatever you want.

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,800
You have all the school's material
at your disposal.

32
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
[school-bell rings]

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,600
Nobody leaves until they have a partner.
Choose one and come by my desk.

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,120
Here's your chance.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,600
For what?

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,160
What do you mean "for what"?
Our plan for Miss Palestine.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
Go and tell her you want to work with her.

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,400
You are with me, right?

39
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,480
That way I get to see you a bit more.
You've been avoiding me of late.

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,360
[chuckles] What a silly thing to say.
Of course we'll work together.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
So, shall we work together?

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,640
You won't have much to do,
I'm telling you. My profile rules.

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,200
And once we upload some photos
of your trophies and the girls you get,

44
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,560
yours will be ready in no time.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,680
-Then we can smoke a joint.
-Shut up!

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,120
We can work together, if you want.

You and I?

49
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
Okay.

50
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,200
Shall we work together?

51
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,320
-But we have nothing in common.
-Even better.

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,400
That way we learn more about each other.

[Samu] Nano, are those burgers ready?

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,480
Almost there. Why the hurry?

[Samu] Get a move on. I told them you had
experience and they are complaining.

We were so happy in this town
without these fancy people!

62

I don't know where she is.
I think Carla is avoiding me.

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
You must have done something.

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,280
You're nuts if you don't take care of her.
You won't find another one like her.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,000

00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,080
I didn't know things
between you two were that bad.

474
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,880
-But--
-Listen, and if Carla falls for him?

475
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,560
Anyway...

476
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,960
End this as soon as possible, Polito.

477
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,440
OK?

478
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,280
[door opens]

479
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Martín?

480
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,480
I have a question. May I come in?

481
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,200
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you.

482
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
I know that...

483
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,320
The new ones
getting into the school, and...

484
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,480
being at a great disadvantage,

485
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,720
it's logical for you to pay them
more attention.

486
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,640
I don't know how to put it,
so it doesn't sound so rude.

487
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,160
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll find the words. Tell me.

488
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,640
Do you think

489
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,400
it's okay to pay more attention to a girl
with such archaic and non feminist values?

490
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,920
Are you asking me to discriminate?

491
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,360
No, just telling you not to pay her
so much attention.

492
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,720
I mean, she does not pay your salary,
the rest of the parents do.

493
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,280
[students chattering]

494
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,120
I am your teacher, Lu, not your employee.

495
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,080
And I'm telling you,
your contract is renewed every year.

496
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,080
And that the idea of the new ones
getting into the school was not...

497
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,240
popular with our parents.
It was all just a pose.

498
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,840
Thank you.

499
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,640
Think about it.

500
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,000
Whose side you are on. Have a good day.

501
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,840
I wish those three
had never come to the school, that's all.

502
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,920
-Do you hate them so much?
-I'm not the only one, I can assure you.

503
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,440
Hello.

504
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,360
Hello.

505
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
-What are you doing here?
-Shall we work?

506
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,080
Let's.

507
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,640
So, do you want to take some pictures
since we have good light here?

508
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,920
-Don't be shy, tell me how to pose.
-I think this is stupid.

509
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,120
Let me see.

510
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,600
Is this how you see me? Only this?

511
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,560
Don't be afraid to sexualize me
a little bit. Relax, take a couple more.

512
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,720
Get dressed.

513
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,640
You are so boring, really.

514
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,960
-What are you doing?
-There's no one here.

515
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,560
Since we are here,
and you're not looking at me...

516
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,080
At least ask me questions, okay?

517
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,760
Well... I don't know.

518
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,920
Why are you hell-bent
on working on this project with me?

519
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,600
Is it to laugh at me?

520
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,040
As you're not taking any pictures of me,
I will take one of you. Stand over there.

521
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,280
There's good light.

522
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,800
[clears throat]

523
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,200
Let's see.

524
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,320
Turn around.

525
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,120
Turn slightly to your left.

526
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,160
To your left, Nadia! Are you dyslexic?
[laughs]

527

[camera clicks]

528
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,400
-I should delete it.
-Why?

529
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,000
It doesn't say anything about you.
I have no fucking idea of who you are.

530
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,480
[chuckles] I'll wait for you outside.

531
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,120
What happened?

532
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,240
Some men came asking for Nano.

533
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,480
I didn't let them in
and they forced the door.

534
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,560
-Let me get this--
-Nothing's happened.

535
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
They only meant to scare her, that's all.

536
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,600
-I told her it won't happen again.
-Was it the guys from La Cabaña?

537
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,240
Who from La Cabaña?

538
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,480
-No, what about La Cabaña?
-Come.

539
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,440
Who from La Cabaña,
what did you get into?

540
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,040
Shut the door.

541
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,800
Tell me, Nano.

542
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Do you think it's normal for some junkies
to come here and threaten mom?

543
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,320
I owe a lot of money, Samu. A lot.

544
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,360
What are you saying?
You just got out of jail.

545
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,400
I owe it to the jail people.
To the people who protected me.

546
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,640
-I promised a lot of money.
-What are you saying?

547
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,640
-What are you saying?
-That things were messed up there.

548
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,520
And I had to figure things out.

549
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,360
Look at the present they gave me.

550
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,560
I didn't tell you so as not to scare you.
But now I need to pay up.

551
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,960
Samu, if something happens to me,
I don't care, it's my fucking problem.

552
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,480
-But I can't let anything happen to you.
-Are you being serious, Nano?

553
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,960
Do I look like I'm joking?

554
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,120
Help me.

555
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,360
How?

556
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,520
[huffs] I saw what fancy girl told you.

557
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,080
About her father's papers.

558
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Help me get them.
I can sell them, blackmail him.

559
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,320
You're telling me you got into my computer
when I've told you a thousand--

560
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,680
Can you think of a better way
to get 40.000 bucks?

561
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,240
If you have one, tell me.

562
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,200
Nano, you are on fucking parole.
I can't let you do that.

563
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,840
If I don't do it, we are fucked.

564
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Mom... you and I.

565
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,600
Brother, I'm screwed.

566
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,160
I'll do it myself.

567
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,800
I'll get you the papers.

-Hello.

[huffs] Fuck!

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,080
Looking for this?

572
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,520
You have no right to search my room.
How did you find it?

573
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,440
Guzmán, who's a good friend of yours.

574
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,640
Do you know what can happen
if you test positive for drugs?

575
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,360
It's the second time I buy.

576
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,560
And why?
Why do you want to ruin your career?

577
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,960
-Come on, it's just a joint.
-You are an idiot.

This is the last time.

I... I think we should drop
this thing with Christian.

582
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,040
-Why?
-I've been talking to Guzmán.

583
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,360
As I was telling him about it,
I realized how stupid it sounded.

584
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,600
What are we doing?

585
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,920
Polo, are we really going to stop
experimenting and having fun

586
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,560
because of what you friend thinks?

587
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,920
We all know what he's like.

588
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,720
And also, we are playing with fire.

589
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,400
It's not normal.

590
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,520
It's not normal for people our age
to do these things.

591
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,440
And that's it.

592
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,320
-Right?
-When have you and I been normal?

593
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,360
My mom is a wine-making marchioness,

594
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,440
and your mothers a pair of rich
and mega influential lesbians.

595
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,280
You and I are anything but normal.

596
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,080
I don't know.

597
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,080
You don't want to feel again
the way you did the other day?

598
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,640
Or yesterday?

599
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:48,760
Because I can't stop thinking about it.
And I know you.

600
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,720
I know you feel the same.

601
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,480
I don't think it's the same.

602
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,360
Our lives are already written.
And I'm not saying they are bad lives.

603
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,120
But, why not depart from the script,
at least a little bit?

604

I don't know, Carla.

-What don't you know?
-I don't know.

-What? That you love me?
-Huh?

-I do love you.
-I love you.

in a while. Thank you.

Sorry, why do you want to talk to me?

614

They are questioning everybody,
don't worry.

615
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,480
They suspect Guzmán.

I'm a little tired.

623

I have to show you what I've done.
I have your profile almost ready.

I am still a bit stuck with yours.

[chuckles] How come?

626
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,120
If you want we can work on it
this afternoon at my place.

627
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,320
Sure.

628

The thing is, my mother is at home,

Do you care so much
about that bumpkin's feelings?

786
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,240
The only bumpkin here...

787
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:14,920
is you.

788
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,600
Fuck off!

789
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,760
You don't tell me to fuck off, Carla.
Carla!

HEY, FINALLY

794
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,360
ANDER
SORRY. I'VE BEEN BUSY

795
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,000
OMAR
WANT SOME POT?

796
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,520
ANDER
NO, I'D RATHER SEE YOU WITHOUT AN EXCUSE

797
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,560
-Hi, darling.
-Hi, Dad.

798
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,160
How did it go with Samuel?

799
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,000
Good. We finished the project.

800
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:00,840
Were you at Samuel's?

801
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,280
[TV playing]

802
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,360
-Dad...
-I didn't expect this from you.

803
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,080
You just lied to me.
That's not typical of a daughter like you.

804
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,560
I don't want those people
to change you, Nadia.

805
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,160
And I don't want you
to disappoint your mother and me.

[huffs]

807
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:23,360
We have sacrificed a lot for you two.

808
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,200
Don't make us feel we made a mistake.

809
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,120
No more lies.

810
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,000
Don't you have to study?

811
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,320
There is no power or strength
saved in Allah.

812
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,640
Omar, leave me alone, I have to study.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET TOMORROW?

OMAR
I'M REALLY BUSY

817
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,360
What do you mean you don't have it?
You said you would get it.

818
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,920
I couldn't do it, alright?
I'm not going to rob her father.

819
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,760
-You'd rather save her family than ours?
-I didn't do it because I like her.

820
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,680
I like Marina very much.

821
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,880
You, dumbshit!

822
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,720
You have nothing to do with her. Samu!

823
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,680
What?

824
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,280
You are screwing me for a girl
who doesn't give a shit about you.

825
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,720
You are an idiot!

<i>Guys, I got all your projects in my inbox,</i>

827
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,120
<i>and I wanted to thank you.</i>
<i>I'm very happy with them.</i>

828
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,240
<i>I imagine you've realized this was</i>

829
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,200
a very important project to get to know
ourselves better,

830
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,160
and to find out what it is that we want
others to know about us.

831
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,480
What is the image we want to project.

832
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,720
What is it we hide from others.

833
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:42,920
Are we really...

834
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,800
what others believe we are,
or do they only see our best side?

835
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Do you want me to tell you
what Marina was like?

836
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,280
Marina was light.

837
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,280
Marina was...

838
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,120
one of those people
you meet on a Monday and...

839
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,600
you want to look in the face, because you
know she will smile and brighten your day.

840
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,160
Do you have any more questions?

841
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,080
Guzmán...

842
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,320
Maybe there's one thing
you didn't know about your sister.

843
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,640
Look.

844
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,640
We got the...

845
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,040
autopsy results.

846
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,080
She was pregnant.
