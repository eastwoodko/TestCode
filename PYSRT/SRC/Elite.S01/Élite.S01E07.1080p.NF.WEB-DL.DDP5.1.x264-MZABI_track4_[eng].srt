00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,160
[woman] What happened in town
a few days before Marina's death?

2
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
What do you mean?
Haven't you seen the news?

3
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,200
-Is there no police report?
-I want you to tell me.

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,360
Everything happened.

5
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,320
-Things were really tense.
-Too much.

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,040
When gunpowder meets fire...

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,320
...only one thing can happen.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,080
-An explosion.
-Boom.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,040
Everything turned to shit.

10
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,120
Everything.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,760
[Samu] The burner phone,
so they can't trace the call.

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,680
[Nano] Okay.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,040
-Got the marchioness' husband's number?
-Yes.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,120
Here it is.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,600
His name is Teodoro Rosol.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,600
We need to decide how much to ask for
for the watch.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
A whole lot, the more the better.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,480
That one will pay whatever we ask
to get this back.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,240
[Samu] No, we need to be clever.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,520
It has to be an amount he can get
without attracting attention.

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,960
And how much is that for a rich person?

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,280
Two hundred thousand?

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,880
-Five hundred thousand?
-No, he won't have that at home.

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,080
Much less. Besides, if he withdraws it
from a bank, they will trace it.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,120
I'd ask for 90,000.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,240
Yes, 90,000 is good.
With that, we can do a lot.

27
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,320
I could start afresh somewhere else
with half that money.

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,680
Are you sure you want to leave?
We are okay, aren't we?

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
I don't want to miss you again.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,040
I'm not needed here, Samu.
You're better off without me.

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
Believe me.

32
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,360
It will be good for everybody.

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
[watch ticking]

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,160
[school bell ringing]

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
No, they've frozen our accounts,
and we can't make bail.

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,480
Three hundred thousand.

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,640
No, no.

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,040
No, you wouldn't have to cover it all.

39
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,480
I see.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
Fine. Thank you, Federico.
Have a good day.

41
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,840
Asshole.

42
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,040
My mothers can cover part of it.

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,280
For any more, they would have to withdraw
from investment funds, which takes time.

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Thank you. Tell them I'll call them later.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,560
What about Lu's parents?

46
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,000
They are diplomats,
and can't get involved.

47
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,840
Besides, I don't want anything
to do with her.

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
I get it.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,640
Testing, one two, one two, testing.

50
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,880
Let's hear it.

-Yes.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,840
Okay.

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,920
Hello?

57
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Yes, speaking.

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,080
[electronic voice]

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,360
Who are you?

61
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,240
<i>-Do you have my watch?</i>
-We want 90,000 euros.

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,640
-Tomorrow.
-Ninety thousand euros?

63
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,840
[chuckles]

64
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,680
You better hand it to me tomorrow,
and expect nothing in return.

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
You don't know
who you're messing with, idiots.

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,640
Have the money tomorrow.

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,920
We'll contact you for the exchange.

68
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,440
How was it?

69
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
Fine, I think.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
-He was scared.
-Good.

71
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,600
-He'll pay for sure.
-Good.

72
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,720
[sighs]

73
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
Who do they think they are?

74
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,280
They want to blackmail me? Me?

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,280
They want a measly 90,000 euros!

76
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,520
You're not paying?

77
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,000
-How could I give in to amateurs?
-Wouldn't it be better to pay?

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,640
It's not that much money.

79
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,440
-Do you know them, or what?
-That's ridiculous, dad!

80
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,640
I'm only saying the person
who called is a clueless nobody.

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
When they got in here to steal,
they even knew the alarm codes.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,160
And since, lately,
you make friends with anybody...

83
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,760
-Good morning, Carla.
-Hi.

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,960
-Teodoro.
-Good morning, darling.

85
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,520
-I can't believe you'd say this to me--
-Everything all right?

86
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,400
Don't worry. If someone's tried to pull
something on me, I know what to do.

87
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
So do I.

88
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,600
To begin with,
they won't get a single penny. Not one.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,120
They should know that.

90
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,480
Were you waiting for me?

91
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,000
I've been up since seven, making calls
to get the money. It's horrible.

92
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,120
I see.

93
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,360
I'm sure someone will lend it to you.

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,560
Doesn't seem like it.

95
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,160
Rats are the first to abandon ship,
and my father's world was full of rats.

96
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
It's good to see you.

97
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,240
[chuckles] Are you going to
stick to me all day long?

98
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,040
What will your friends think
when they see you this clingy?

99
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,680
I want to make the most of these days
with you, if they are your last.

100
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
[sighs]

101
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,080
We have to keep you here
for the next school year, Nadia.

102
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,960
It's hopeless, Guzmán.

103
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,880
Once my father makes up his mind,
he's inflexible.

104
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
You should go to class.

105
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,360
-Go on.
-Fine, I'm going, bye.

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,520
Nadia.

107
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,760
-Can you do me a favor?
-Yes.

108
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,040
Can you give this to your brother?

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,920
My brother?

110
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,200
Yes. Your father took away his cell phone.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,280
I don't want to go near the store,
or they could see me talking to him.

112
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,760
Nadia.

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,720
-Can we talk after class?
-We have nothing to talk about.

114
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,320
Do you know
you've ruined my brother's life?

115
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,440
That's why I want to talk to you, explain
what happened. I didn't have a choice.

116
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
There's always a choice, Marina. Always.

117
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,520
But people from your class never consider
anything but saving their own ass.

118
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,000
-If you'll excuse me...
-So, betraying your brother is wrong,

119
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,320
but you betraying Martín
is awesome, right?

120
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,600
Are you really making that comparison?

121
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
We need to talk.
Come to the bathroom with me?

122
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,080
I'm all ears.

123
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,800
Why did you get close to me
after ignoring me for years?

124
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,200
What?

125
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,280
Who stole the watches?

126
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,520
I know you are involved.

127
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,120
You were in my house,
saw me enter the code,

128
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
and, as girls, we used to play
with my father's watches.

129
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,280
You knew where they were.

130
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,720
Me?

131
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,840
Come on, Carla,
do you think I remember that?

132
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,200
How can you think that?

133
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,720
Well, you have a history of
making crappy friends

134
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,560
and falling under their influence.

135
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,280
You seem stupid.

136
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,680
Marina, they are blackmailing us.

137
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,280
And your family stands to lose
more than mine.

138
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,560
Your father is in pre-trial detention,
and if these papers were to surface...

139
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
not even the best lawyer will get him out.

140
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
Carla, I know nothing about it, really.

141
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,360
My father will not pay.

142
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,960
You think he's going to let some idiots
take his money and get away with it?

143
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
No.

144
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,480
He's going to find them,
and it will be bad for everybody.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,040
Mostly for you.

146
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,200
So tell them to keep the watches,
but to return the red one.

147
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
And to do it now.

148
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,560
Fucking Nano!

149
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,360
<i>Nano, we agreed you would forget</i>
<i>about the blackmail.</i>

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,400
-You've put me in a difficult situation!
-<i>Marina, don't worry about a thing.</i>

151
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
How can I not worry?

152
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,040
That watch contains sensitive information.

153
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,960
If it reaches the press,
it will ruin my family.

154
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,240
I won't let you do it.

155
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,200
<i>That information won't reach anybody,</i>
<i>trust me.</i>

156
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,440
<i>That guy will pay.</i>
<i>We need that money to go away together.</i>

157
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,360
I haven't said I'm leaving with you.

158
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,400
Carla.

159
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Here.

160
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,840
-What's this?
-Do you like it?

161
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,560
A bit obvious, don't you think?

162
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,280
Your way of telling me
you can buy me these things,

163
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
but Christian not.

164
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,400
It's just a present,
I don't mean to buy you.

165
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,360
You can't buy me.

166
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,560
I don't have a price, and if I did,
you couldn't afford it.

167
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
Are you going to let that loser
ruin everything we have?

168
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,960
<i>You</i> ruined it.<i></i>Not him.

169
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,200
And I'm the one in front of you,
asking you to forgive me.

170
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,280
I don't...

171
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,760
I can't live without you.

172
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
-Don't you see I can't?
-Yes, you can.

173
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,520
You know why?

174
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
Because, I think you like boys
more than girls.

175
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,760
And it's no big deal. That's fine.

176
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,160
You just need to accept it yourself.
I'm working on it.

177
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,280
So what if I also like guys?

178
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,040
What we have is stronger than all that.
We're Carla and Polo.

179
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,480
We go together.

180
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,400
That can't be broken.

181
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,000
It's already broken.

182
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,480
Would you like a photo?

183
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,560
It's your moment of triumph.
I'd like to give you my best angle.

184
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,480
You are top of the class,
the prize is for you. As if I cared.

185
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,880
Lu, I'm also leaving the school.

186
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,480
My father doesn't want me
 to do my next year here.

187
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,760
So we won the top idiot prize
by competing, right?

188
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,160
I never wanted to compete.

189
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,640
Nadia, please!

190
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,080
From day one, I recognized you
as my equal. Even if you won't admit it.

191
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,320
For you and me, nothing is ever enough.
We always want more.

192
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,960
Did you really think that prize
would change anything in my life?

193
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,360
No.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,440
And still... I needed it.

195
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,720
Too bad another hypocrite will get it.

196
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,440
Marina?

197
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,480
She's the best after the two of us.

198
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,240
She screwed us over really well.

199
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,280
Turned out to be smarter
than everybody else.

200
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
But I'll tell you one thing.

201
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,480
I won't leave without a fight.

202
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,200
Or without winning.

203
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
So what happened between you and Polo?

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,080
I left him.

205
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,400
We wanted to keep our relationship
alive by any means,

206
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
-but dead things don't come back to life.
-Damn, I'm sorry.

207
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,640
But then you have no boyfriend.
You are alone, free.

208
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,240
Yes, alone, free, with no close friends,
and a thousand problems.

209
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,800
I did not expect this
going into the summer.

210
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,600
-But then you and I could...
-We could what, Christian?

211
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,160
We could date!

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,320
-We have great sex, right?
-Yes.

213
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,720
I don't know if I'd want to date someone
who sells himself for a cover.

214
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,400
I don't sell myself, okay?

215
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,520
I make a living, which is what those of us
who were not born millionaires do!

216
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,800
-It's very easy to judge us from up there.
-All right, Christian!

217
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,840
Christian, wait!

218
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,040
Fine, you're right.
I'm not in your situation.

219
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,720
Don't you think that's precisely why
we cannot be together?

220
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,960
Honestly, no.
Stranger things have happened.

221
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,880
You could give me a chance.

222
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,760
The only thing I need right now
is a friend.

223
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,680
Think you can be that?

224
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,680
Yes.

Omar.

226
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,000
Remember Fatima and Nasser?

227
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,560
-Of course.
-She used to look after you.

228
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,640
-How are you, Omar? You're all grown up.
-How are you?

229
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
A very good son. Very responsible.

230
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,200
Follows the Koran.

231
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,800
And very hard-working.

232
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,160
He has a daughter, about your age.

233
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,000
-You know her, right?
-Yes.

234
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,880
Why don't you come for tea
on Wednesday and bring her along?

235
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,320
[Omar] I don't know if I can on Wednesday.

236
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,160
Do you have anything better to do
than meet your future wife?

237
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,720
Bye, then.

238
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,160
And don't rush him.

239
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,400
We don't want him looking that scared
when we introduce them.

240
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,800
[both fathers laugh]

241
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,520
-[Yusef] See you soon.
-[Nasser] Bye, my friend.

242
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,280
I get it, my father is a leper
and you won't help him. Very well.

243
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,120
Never mind, when he returns to work
I'll remind him who was there, asshole!

244
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,240
-Everything all right?
-What are you doing here, Lu?

245
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,720
I go to school for my things,
and don't see you.

246
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,480
I call and text you, and you don't answer.

247
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,600
I'm beginning to feel
a bit ignored, actually.

248
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,560
You don't see me for three days,
and I'm already forgotten?

249
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,000
Sorry, I don't know why,
but all I can think of

250
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,640
is getting money to bail my father out.

251

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,760
And you can't answer one of my messages
while you're holding your phone.

253
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,600
Lu, right now the last thing I need
is your passive-aggressive drama.

254
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,680
And what do you need? Money.

255
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,480
How much?

256
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,760
Three hundred thousand.
Got them in your bag?

257
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,480
Why are you being such a jerk?

258
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,920
I only wanted to help.

259
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,760
Oh, you came to help me, sorry!

260
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,200
I thought it was
because I didn't answer your calls.

261
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,480
If you are not well, lean on me.

262
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,760
Don't insult me.

263
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,920
And don't push me aside.

264

through the good and the bad.

so you get it once and for all?

is go along with him for a while.

For how long?

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,760
But don't risk everything you have
and endanger your family.

475
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,880
-Thank you for coming again.
-This is becoming a habit.

476
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,480
-What happened now?
-Nothing bad, I assure you.

477
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,920
It's about your daughter.

478
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,640
I heard you don't want her to come here
next school year.

479
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,240
We are delighted with her.

480
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,600
She's got an excellent record here.
She has adapted wonderfully.

481
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,720
-It's a thoughtfully considered decision.
-I'm not saying it isn't.

482
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,040
But if there was a way
to change your mind...

483
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,760
we think you are taking a wonderful
opportunity from her.

484
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,800
Are you saying I'm a bad father?
That, as an uneducated Muslim,

485
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,720
-I don't know what's best for her?
-No, no, no.

486
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,960
I'm just trying to make you see
that Nadia...

487
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,480
would get many advantages,
were she to remain at this school.

488
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,200
-She has learned a lot so far.
-Yes.

489
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,000
She has learned to disrespect her parents.
To lie, to sneak out of her house.

490
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,600
-To neglect her religious duties.
-Normal for a teenager.

491
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,040
They all rebel at that age.

492
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,960
Hey.

493
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,840
What are you doing? We have an exam.

494
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,960
Is that what you teach here?

495
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
To be permissive of rebelliousness?

496
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Don't turn the paper until I tell you.

497
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,840
Don't worry, there's nothing there
we haven't gone over a thousand times.

498
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,760
Excuse me.

499
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,160
What are you doing here, Lucrecia?
You are suspended.

500
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,320
I know, but I have the right
to take this exam.

501
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,880
I'll sit over there.

502
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,760
Nadia, we're leaving.

503
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,000
-What?
-I'm taking you out of here immediately.

504
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,920
-Let's go.
-Excuse me. Yusef, let's talk.

505
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,120
Don't take it like that.
I never meant to offend you.

506
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,560
Don't make her pay for it.

507
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,680
Nadia, let's go.
Don't make me repeat myself.

508
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,400
Dad, we are about to start an exam.

509
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,360
Let's go!

510
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,840
-Don't treat her like that!
-Shut up!

511
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,640
-Don't grab her like that!
-Dad! Dad!

512
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,400
I feel for her! For her and for your son.

513
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,240
To be a woman or a homosexual
in your family must be hell! Poor Omar!

514
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,800
Dad.

515
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,040
-Hey!
-What?

516
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,720
What are you insinuating about my son?

517
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,840
Go back to class.

518
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,560
Let's go.

519
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,840
You too.

520
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,160
Come on.

521
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,960
[students murmur]

522
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,520
Carry on with your exam.
Nothing happened.

523
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,840
What are you doing here?

524
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,760
[teacher] She says she has a right
to take the exam.

525
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,200
Out! Right now.

526
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,080
-[Marina giggling]
-What are you laughing at, idiot?

527
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,360
[Polo] If you think you'll get Carla,
you are mistaken.

528
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,960
As a hobby you were fine, but...
you're too small-fry for her.

529
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,360
Right.

530
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
But I wasn't too small-fry for you, right?

531
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,560
What did you like best about me? My ass.

532
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,320
Or my dick?

533
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,520
Because you held on to it well.

534
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,600
Asking for a beating, are you?!

535
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,760
You'll never be her boyfriend,
you hear me? Never!

536
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,480
Maybe.

537
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,800
But that is more likely to happen
than you fucking me again.

538
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,040
I didn't force you, remember?

539
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,600
You allowed yourself to be bought.

540
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,680
You're no better than me.

541
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,560
What are you looking at?

542
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,200
What's wrong?

543
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,080
Your fucking ex!
He sure knows how to push my buttons!

544
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,560
Calm down. Look at me, okay? Calm down.

545
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,160
Ignore him. Just ignore him.

546
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,920
Okay?

547
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,360
We could do something fun today.
Introduce me to your friends.

548
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,240
You know my world,
but I don't know yours. Okay?

549
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
You!

550
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,840
Tell me why you are being slandered!

551
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,920
What have you done
for them to think you like men?

552
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,840
[Nadia] Dad!

553
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,280
Tell me it's not true! Tell me!

554
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,640
[pants] Dad...

555
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,480
Tell me my son is not a homosexual.

556
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,640
No, I don't know who told you that,
but no.

557
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,960
I'm not.

558
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,440
It's all right.

559
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,320
Tomorrow we'll meet Fatima
and her daughter.

560
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,360
And if she's not the right wife for you,
then another.

561
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,120
But we'll find one soon.

562
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm not going to let anybody
tarnish your good name.

563
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,680
Or this family's.

564
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,880
[slams door]

565
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,360
I am a coward.

566
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,960
No.

567
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,720
You did what you had to do.

568
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,520
What happened? Why does he know?

569
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,360
-The school principal told him.
-What?

570
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,920
Isn't that Ander's mother?
What is she doing?

571
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,400
She just ruined my life.

572
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,760
Yours and mine.
Dad dragged me out of class.

573
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,440
In front of everybody. So humiliating.

574
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,360
[door bell rings]

575
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,320
-Hello, Pilar.
-Hi, cutie.

576
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,880
-Is Samuel here?
-No, he's at work.

577
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,720
Do you mind if I wait for him here?

578
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,800
-Sure, come in.
-I don't want to go home.

579
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,720
Because of what's going on with my father.

580
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,040
Some story, that one.

581
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,040
I know.

582
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,440
-I don't think he'll be long.
-It's okay, I'll wait here.

583
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,000
You caught me with my cards.

584
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,720
Hey, do you want me to read them for you?

585
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,360
Maybe we find out
when your father gets out.

586
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,960
-[Marina chuckles] No.
-This is never wrong.

587
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,280
-Could I use your bathroom?
-Of course, you know where it is.

588
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,200
Thank you.

[door closes]

591
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,760
Looking for this?

592
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,720
Yes, but not to give it to them.

593
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,000
I wanted to keep it,
and keep it from the papers.

594
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
I told you I would not
give it to the papers.

595
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,400
But here.

596
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,680
I do trust you.

597
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,480
I only ask one thing.

598
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,640
Let them pay us.

599
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,200
That money is loose change to them.
A bargain, after what they did.

600
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,320
And when they pay us,
you do what you want with the watch.

601
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,280
Sure?

we are having a child together.

If I don't trust you,
who am I going to trust?

605

I haven't made up my mind to keep it yet.

606
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,280
Do you know how many calls
I had to make to get that money?

607
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,680
Do you know what it cost me?
But that didn't matter to those losers.

608
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,960
Because for them
we are only fucking posh people.

609

You didn't think the town would be upset?
To see your father go free?

610
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,320
What? The law is the same for everybody.

611
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,520
If a judge sets bail, and you can pay it,
that's not illegal.

612
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,920
You didn't know
you were walking into a hornet's nest?

They released you.

Thanks to your brother, who did not stop
until he raised the money to pay bail.

617
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
He's shown me a lot.

618
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,280
-Marina, we need to talk.
-About what, Dad?

619
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,560
Teo tells me you are involved
in the theft of the watches.

620
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,600
Who are your friends, child?

00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,520
-They have brainwashed you.
-Marina.

622

Do you know how serious this is?

623
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,360
All that's at stake?

624
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,200
-Dad, why do you think I'm involved?
-Carla told us everything.

625
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,680
And it wouldn't be the first time
you hung out with riffraff like that.

626
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,080
Riffraff, Guzmán?

627
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,360
Dad went to jail,
but they are the riffraff?

628
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,520
-What are you saying?
-Don't go there, please.

629
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
So you do have something
to do with those losers.

630
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,360
-Marina, you just don't learn.
-What losers are you talking about?

631
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,160
I'm tired of your arrogance, and yours!

632
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,720
So they caught you red-handed?
Deal with it!

633
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,240
-[all speaking together]
-Everybody calm down.

634
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,680
-Sure, ask us to calm down now.
-How can I calm down with this nut job,

635
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,160
-who prefers those losers to her family!
-You know what, Guzmán?

636
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,800
With those people you call losers,
I'm making my own family.

637
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,080
More authentic and less hypocritical.

638
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,280
What do you mean?

639
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,160
I'm pregnant.

640
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,760
Marina.

641
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,840
Please, say that's not true.

642
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,280
[Guzman] Who's the father?

643
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,560
That waiter?

644
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,960
No. His brother.

645
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,760
That's why you helped him
with the theft, huh?

646
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,040
That's it. I'll fix this right now!

647
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,480
Where are you going?

648
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,200
Ander, call Polo, you have to help me.

649
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,440
Now!

650
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,760
Marina, please.
Think about what you're saying.

651
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,640
Don't do things
out of spite for your parents.

652
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,680
You can't have a child now.
Much less, with a boy like that!

653
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,200
-Even you should realize that!
-Do you think I can reason with you?

654
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,480
Look at yourself! You're so prejudiced!

655
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,480
Just thinking your girl may not date
a future minister makes you freak out!

656
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,440
-That boy is blackmailing us!
-[father] You are underage,

657
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,320
and you will do as we say.

658
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,360
That's it. And you will not go ahead
with that pregnancy, you hear?

659
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,200
Wait and see. But don't worry,
this child will not meet its grandparents.

660
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,400
[sighs]

661
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,440
[panting]

662
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,680
Nano,

663
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,560
listen, we can leave together
whenever you want, okay?

664
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,960
Guzmán, this is crazy.

665
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,400
Wait, stop. Stop, damn it!

666
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,800
What? Damn it, Ander!

667
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,040
Must I remind you of what happened
last time you tried to fix things?

668
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,320
-They got fixed.
-You almost killed Pablo.

669
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,360
We go to these people's house,
take what's ours, and leave.

670
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,440
-Or are you getting cold feet?
-They are not at home.

671
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,920
Carla's just posted this.

672
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,480
I swear she's all right.

673
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,360
Carla's here for a reason.

674
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,480
Why would she ask so many questions?
She doesn't trust me or my brother.

675
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,160
No, man, she likes me, for real.
She's mad about me.

676
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,600
Son of a bitch!
You may fool your brother, but not me.

677
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,040
First you steal from me.
And then get my sister pregnant.

678
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,840
[everybody yelling]

679
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
[Christian grunting]

680
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,000
You are an asshole!

681
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,560
Ah! Fuck!

682
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,240
-I won't let that bastard end up with you!
-Go to hell!

683
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,520
[Samu shouts] Son of a bitch!

684
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,520
Ander! Let's go!

685
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,160
[people yelling]

686
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,000
-Come back here!
-Son of a bitch!

687
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,320
-Please, open.
-[door-bells jingling]

688
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,920
-Please, I'm being chased!
-Go away!

689
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,760
Nadia. Nadia.

690
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,120
That boy isn't your problem.
Let him fend for himself!

691
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,720
Say what you want, he's coming in.

692
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,760
They are after me!

693
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,240
Call the police!

694
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,920
Why the police?

695
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,560
[man] Son of a bitch!

696
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,000
See why I didn't want you to befriend him?
He's trouble!

697
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,760
Ander!

698
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,200
Ander!

699
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,200
I love you.

700
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,000
I love you, damn it!

701
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,360
Asshole, they had to kill me
for you to say it.

702
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,600
Oh, what's wrong?

703
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,480
Samuel?

704
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,760
Samuel, what's going on?

705
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,720
Aggh!

706
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,280
Samuel.

707
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,320
Samuel, what did you do?

708
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
[panting]
