You can't use your cell phone here.

If they catch you, they'll take it,
and keep it for a week.

You'd be saving us a lot of time and work
if you answered a simple question.

53
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,720
Why did you have blood on you?

Hi there.

[Martin] Good morning, class!
How's everybody doing today?

75
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,520
Please, sit down.

76
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,200
[Martin] Okay.

77
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,520
So, as we all know, we have three
new students with us today.

78
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,960
Let's meet them.

-Damn. Wasn't this a tutorial class?
-In English. It's a bilingual school.

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
You knew that, right?

Christian Varela.

82
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,520
Yes.

83
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,040
Do you want to introduce yourself
to the class?

84
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,280
What's he saying?

85
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,600
Introduce yourself.

86
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
Ah! Yes.

87
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,280

Thank you, mister teacher.

-[Lu whispers] "Mister teacher."
-Nadia Shana.

93
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,320
Hello, I'm Nadia. I'm 16.

94
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,520
My family is from Palestine.
But I was born here in Spain.

95
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
And when I finish my studies,

96
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,400
I'd like to be professional diplomat
in the United Nations.

97
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,880
Wow! Impressive.

98
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,080
You know, every year we choose
our best student, and...

99
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,360
the trophy is rather ugly,

100
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,160
but it allows you to study the following
year at... Who can tell me where?

101
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,160
Carla.

102
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,600
At a school in Florida.

103
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,320
Which gives you access
to an Ivy League University.

104
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,680
-And how can you win it?
-By standing out in all activities.

105
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,760
Curricular and extracurricular.
The more extracurricular, the better.

106
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,520
Photography, chess, Chinese,
check out the list.

107
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,600
If I were you, I'd watch out for this one.
She'll give you no quarter.

108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,920
Ridiculous.

109
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,880
Wasn't this a secular school?

110
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,800
[Martin] Samuel García.

111
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,800
Hi. My name is Samuel...

112
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,520
and I feel like anything I say
will be used against me,

113
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,080
-so I'll better remain quiet.
-How darling!

114
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,640
Don't be afraid.
At this school we teach values.

115
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,280
Manners and respect are paramount.

116
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,640
The leaders of tomorrow
are at this school.

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,520
I know. That's what I fear.

118
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,800
-What did the waiter say?
-[girls laugh]

119
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
He's talking to us.

120
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,280
-Guys.
-Sorry.

121
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,520
Alright. My name's Samuel, and I am,
as your classmate said, a waiter.

122
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,000
Strange as it may seem to you,
sometimes waiters get a seat at the table.

123
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,680
But you don't need to worry,
I'm not here to take anybody's place.

124
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,440
You are still the leaders of tomorrow.

125
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,720
-[Guzman] Thank you.
-[Samu] You're welcome.

126
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,120
So, why don't we continue
with where we left it yesterday?

127
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
[people chattering]

128
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,960
[Marina] Of all the people there,
you had to mess with my brother.

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,160
That was your brother?

130
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,200
And people say we, rich people,
don't suffer.

131
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,280
I see.

132
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,760
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

133
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,120
Shall we?

134
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,880
Hey... in case nobody's told you,
it's cool having you in class.

135
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,240
Thanks.

136
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,000
Hello.

137
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Where are you going? We'll walk with you.

138
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,000
-Stop being such an asshole.
-Watch that mouth.

139
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,040
We're only trying to be friendly.
What's the matter, waiter?

140
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,760
Do you like my sister?

141
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,680
-She's a fan of lost causes...
-Guzmán, go to hell.

142
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,880
Seriously, leave him alone.

143
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,360
Let us have him for a while.
We want to get to know him.

144
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,320
Or are you afraid of us?

145
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,800
-He is afraid of us!
-He is, yeah.

146
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,520
Waiter... don't lay a hand on my sister.

147
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,320
Imagine you have a restraining order.

148
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,280
Guzmán... take this.

149
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,920
[ducks quacking]

150
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,760
[Martin] Nadia.

151
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,000
Can you come with me for a moment?
The principal wants a word.

152
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
[students chattering]

153
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,960
No one had mentioned the scarf.

154
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,680
Why now?

155
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,400
Per our rules,
no supplementary vestures are allowed.

156
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,360
My hijab is not supplementary.
Besides, everybody has things around here.

157
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Expensive bags, gold watches.

158
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,360
Those are ornamental,
they don't mean anything.

159
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
-Anything wrong?
-No, why?

318
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,440
OK, then. Off to class.

319
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,480
[Christian] Thanks a lot, man.
You're alright.

320
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,440
No, I'm not. I just saved your ass.

321
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,560
You could pay me back.

322
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,960
-[both moan]
-[Lu chuckles]

323
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,880
[Lu] Guzmán!

324
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,360
-What?
-We've been seen, damn it!

325
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,680
-What is it?
-[Lu] Shit!

326
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,400
-We've been seen.
-Shit!

327
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,480
[Christian] Don't worry, he'll be here.
I talked to him ten minutes ago.

328
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,880
Besides, nobody will see you here, man.
Don't worry.

329
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,920
-But can he be trusted, or not?
-Of course!

330
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,760
What's he gonna do? Go on TV
to say a rich boy is buying joints?

331
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,840
Come on! That wouldn't be news.

332
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,160
[Ander]
I just don't want them to know at school.

333
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,640
Who's going to find out?
I won't tell anyone, don't worry, man.

334
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,960
Besides, I don't even have
any friends in there. Or do I?

335
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,520
Yeah! Good man!

336
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,440
By the way, man,
I wanted to ask you something.

337
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,360
-[Ander] Shoot.
-Why do you all mess with us so much?

338
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
[eagle screams]

339
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,160
Something happened
with a scholarship student.

340
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,840
The son of one of the cooks.

341
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,280
And they halted scholarships
for a full year.

342
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,080
It was a huge mess.

343
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,880
Until you arrived.

344
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,160
[whistles] Hey!

345
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,040
What's up, man?

346
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,160
-How are you?
-Hi.

347
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,120
I'll introduce you, Mr. X, Mr. Dealer.
Sorry, no real names.

348
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,280
Thank you, much obliged.

349
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,520
Have you seen how well-mannered?

350
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,120
You can't complain,
I bring you quality clients.

351
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,440
Don't you forget.

352
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,400
By the way, you and I will talk.
You owe me one!

353
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,480
[motorbike beeps]

354
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,000
[Nano] Here we go, now we are all set.

355
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,680
-Hey, my man!
-[Christian] So good to see you!

356
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,040
[Nano] Twelve, thirteen, fourteen...

357
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,280
Hang in there!
Fifteen, sixteen, that's it!

358
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,720
So, they make a school collapse,
and get away with it.

359
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Can't wrap my fucking head around that!

360
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,720
-When will the others be released?
-[Nano] What do I know, man?

361
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,800
That's how the world works.

362
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,240
Some of us in jail for some small shit,
and the real crooks out on the street.

363
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,520
It figures.

364
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,680
I almost didn't live to tell it.
I got a huge cut in my head.

365
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,240
But, that got me a ticket to fancy-land.
[laughs]

366
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,320
It's no joke, Christian,
what if there had been casualties?

367
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,000
This is not okay.
This country is a fucking joke.

368
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,680
Let's give your brother a drink,
we're losing him!

369
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,920
-There are none left.
-[Nano] None?

370
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,880
I can solve that in a second.
Be right back.

371
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,640
[man] Man, save, and you can buy it.

372
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,360
A little stuck on that topic, isn't he?

373
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,760
I mean, I don't know,
Nano is like a brother to me, you know.

374
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,360
And... my brother's brother
is also my brother, right?

375
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,280
You want my notes from class?

WELCOME.
SHALL WE CREATE YOUR PROFILE?

381
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,360

-Catch!
-[Christian snores]

386

I have a romantic idea worthy of a movie.
Jaime, I'm borrowing it.

387
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,120
Nano, can you tell me where we're going?

388
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,800
To visit our friend the constructor,
so he remembers us.

389
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,400
-[Nano] Get off.
-What?

390
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,320
Get off!

391
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,440
Keep watch.

[Nano tweets like a bird]

No! What are you doing?
Don't even think about it!

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Yes! Let's enjoy it, Samu.

You just got out of jail, and this is

What can you tell me about this trophy?

406
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,800
Why?

407
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,080
We think it's the murder weapon.

408
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,200
[Nadia] What?

409
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,840
We've been told
you wanted to win it more than anything.

410
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,560
Just me?

411
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,800
It's her word against ours.

412
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
You want to risk them believing her?

413
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,280
-This is all your fault.
-Mine?

414
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,560
Yes, you and your silly obsession
with doing it in public places.

415
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,360
Sure.

416
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,840
As if you didn't like it.

Hello.

Sorry about yesterday.
We thought we were alone.

I wish.

Look, I know we started off
on the wrong foot. I'd like to fix that.

421

Why don't you come tonight
to my sister's coming out party?

422

We can get to know each other.

Thanks, but no.

-No.
-That's her mommy, the marchioness.

Well, and that guy, Polo,
is her boyfriend, since they were 12.

for the girls here.

You can come in your scarf, or without it.
Come as you want, okay?

It's called a hijab.

444
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,920
Not a scarf.

Hijab.

-And nobody forces me to wear it.
-Lucky you!

447
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,160
I do feel like I'm being forced to have
this ridiculous coming out party.

I don't know. Give us a chance.
We're not all like my brother.

It starts at eight.

don't you wanna go to the party?

give me a break!

to all of this stuff and this luxury,

but I'm not, this is all new to me.
I'm excited about it.

What do you think?
That I live like the rest of them?

-You don't?
-Not even close.

Then what the fuck
are you doing at that school?

-Completely, yes.

-Do you have anything decent to wear?
-[Christian] Of course I do, man!

-[Samu] What are you doing here?
-Nadia wants to go to the party.

And my father says if there's no alcohol,
and there's parents there...

-[Omar] Say yes, I want to go home.
-Yeah, man, don't worry.

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,480
This is a serious party.

472
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,480
THI

473
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,080
What's up, Samu?

474
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,480
-Hi.
-You didn't expect to see me here, huh?

475
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,600
Let's go in!

476
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
[music playing]

477
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,880
Here you have it, a coming out party
in all its ridiculousness!

478
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,920
[Ander] What is it for?
In other times, to find a husband quickly.

479
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,200
Nowadays it's more to widen your network.

480
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,360
Although the husband thing
is not ruled out.

481
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,480
You're so much fun when you drink.

482
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,640
Wow, you rich people know
how to throw a party!

483
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,640
Are you color blind?

484
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,400
Or did you not turn on the light
when you got dressed?

485
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,360
Lu, don't be mean. Handsome guys look good
whatever they wear.

486
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,800
We've already said hi. Are you staying?

487
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,600
I don't know. Do you want me to stay?

488
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,600
-If you say yes, I'll stay forever.
-Well, well, let's start with a drink.

489
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,920
Please.

490
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,080
Ah, move aside.

491
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
[glasses clink]

492
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,600
-[music playing]
-[guests chattering]

493
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,360
Can you explain to me
why you've brought the influencer?

494
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,040
-You've brought the girl, right?
-It's my home, Ander.

495
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,480
I don't know, because he really wanted
to come. Nothing's going to happen.

496
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,360
This whole crusade of yours
against them is ridiculous.

497
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,560
Look...

498
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,680
I forgive you,
because you're really drunk.

499
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,920
But I wouldn't have betrayed you
like that. Never!

500
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,480
What betrayal, Guzmán?

501
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,360
What betrayal?

502
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,080
Fucking champagne! Where's the beer?

503
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,440
[girls chuckle]

504
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,360
You've come.

505
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,480
Dad.

506
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,800
Pleased to meet you.

507
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,080
The balls on you, kid, showing up here!
Don't you know we have security cameras?

508
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,560
[Ventura] Shall we talk later?

509
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,680
Only alcohol can make this tolerable.
Here.

510
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,120
Thanks. I don't drink.

511
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,160
It's going to be a hard night, then.

512
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,520
-I'm leaving soon.
-Of course.

513
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,760
Why give us a chance when you have already
sentenced and judged us all, right?

514
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,920
Here's everything you hate about the West.

515
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,040
All the sinful decadence.

516
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,520
I thought I was the one judging.

517
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,440
But I can see you have decided
what I think and what I don't.

518
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,120
With a scarf on your head,
you can't possibly think much, dear.

519
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,680
Is this about me
not accepting the champagne?

520
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,280
Or your congenital racism?

521
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,720
Forgive me. Oh, no, forgive me.
Sorry, I came here in peace, I swear.

522
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,320
I'm sure you and I
have something in common.

523
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,280
Don't worry.
I've come to Las Encinas to study.

524
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,200
I'm not interested in anything
beyond that.

525
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,920
Let me give you some advice, dear.

526
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,400
You can do it all.

527
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,640
Look at me.

528
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,440
I date, I have fun, a lot.

529
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,480
And I'm top of the class.

530
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,640
Or you were.

531
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,560
Right?

532
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:22,760
So? What do you think of my party?

533
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,240
Wouldn't you love to set us all on fire?

534
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,600
OK. I'll order a glass of water,
just in case.

535
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,560
[Marina laughs]

536
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,360
Samuel...

537
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,920
Sorry I didn't tell you
my father's construction company...

538
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,080
-was the one from your school.
-Right. It would have been good to know.

539
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,920
[huffs] I'm not like him.

540
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,880
And to be honest,
I think I don't even like him.

541
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,640
But he's done all of this for you.

542
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,760
Yeah, he's very good at solving problems
throwing money at them.

543
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Wanna dance?

544
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,960
-What?
-Why are you like this, Lu?

545
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,920
Don't you see?
It's not about the skirt, I don't care.

546
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,400
It's about that Taliban girl.
That little hypocrite.

547
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,680
Wearing a scarf on your head
makes you superior to us?

548
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,760
-Please, how ridiculous!
-I don't want her here either.

549
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,960
But we have to do something,
so she won't tell on us.

550
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,240
[Lu] I have an idea.

551
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,800
Let's hear it.

552
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,080
[Lu] I propose a game.
Why don't you seduce her?

553
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,760
Then everybody finds out...
and that's that.

554
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,480
You want me to hook up
with the Palestinian girl,

555
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,040
who walks around school in a turban?

556
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,200
Oh, sweetie...

557
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,920
the idea of making a virginal Muslim girl
fall for you doesn't turn you on?

558
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,360
Come on, you woo her, she falls for you,
everybody finds out...

559
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,000
That's it! We cut her down to size,
she can't act all superior anymore.

560
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,360
Not even if I ask you?

561
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,760
Then I'll let you do
whatever you want with me.

562
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,520
[both chuckle]

563
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,400
But I already do whatever I want with you.

564
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,680
[Lu laughs] Not even half of it.

565
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,400
I'm thinking, today would be a good day
to do it. Right?

566
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,800
[Christian] I call the tow truck,
and they don't come for me.

567
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Well, I don't know.

568
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,400
Here? Right now?

569
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,200
And why not?

570
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,800
But if you're not sure,
let's forget about it.

571
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,120
Hey.

572
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,640
-Samuel, right?
-Yes.

573
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,520
What exactly did you mean to write here,
on my front wall?

574
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,320
T-H-I...

575
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,440
"S."

576
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,520
"This above all:
to thine own self be true."

577
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,400
-Ah.
-It's a quote from <i>Hamlet.</i>

578
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,160
Yes, of course, a quote from <i>Hamlet.</i>
Ingenious.

579
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,680
But...

580
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,520
I think you wanted to write...

581
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:44,960
Thief, son of a bitch, or one of those
names the press is calling me lately.

582
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,640
Bring the other two scholarship kids,
and we'll take a photo of the four of us.

583
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,480
Shaking hands and smiling.

584
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,200
I don't know.

585
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,640
Come, man.

586
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,800
What's wrong with taking a photo?
It could be good for everybody.

587
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,680
For the town, for the school,
even for you.

588
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,040
I wouldn't feel comfortable doing it,
to be honest.

589
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,320
It's OK, kid.

590
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,360
I'll report your brother to the police
tomorrow, see what happens to his parole.

591
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,160
Think about it.

592
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,480
What did he say?

593
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,360
He wants a picture
with the scholarship students.

594
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,840
-Really?
-Yes.

595
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,600
That's why he wanted me to invite you.
His image makeover bullshit.

596
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,840
He doesn't waste an opportunity.

597
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,760
Samuel, don't play along.
You don't have to.

598
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,200
I don't mind doing it.

599
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,400
What's wrong?

600
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,320
Nothing.

601
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,760
I don't know.
I thought you were different.

602
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,760
[Carla] Hello.

Can you come and get me?

Come on, [claps hands]

We have 15 minutes
before they realize I'm not there.

611
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,240
Are you taking your clothes off?

That comes off, too.

613
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,600
But slowly, so I can see you.

Okay. You too.
Let's do it at the same time.

Am I doing it right?

Yes, you're doing fucking great.

00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,960
You knew it was him who ruined our wall,

629
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,960
and you let him in our home?

630
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,040
Who?

631
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,160
The thin one.

632
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,080
But only because he had ulterior motives,
he wanted a picture with him.

633
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,520
What?

634
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,840
Mom, I don't know why you are surprised.

635
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,880
You are the only one
dad still manages to disappoint.

636
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,360
Those people are poison, Marina,
and you know it.

637
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,480
Why are you with them every time
I turn around, Marina? Why?

638
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,800
Why don't you leave them alone?

639
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,240
Because I refuse
to let you get hurt again, Marina!

640
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,720
-Pablo did not mean to hurt me!
-Marina!

641
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,280
It's not the moment. Please.

642
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,800
[Marina] Then when?

643
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,000
Tell me when is the moment.
Why can't we talk about what happened?

644
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,040
You've spent a fortune on psychologists
to convince me nothing happened.

645
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,080
That life goes on.
That everything would be alright.

646
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,600
And you know what?

647
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,040
Every time you avoid the subject,
I feel like a piece of shit.

648
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,240
I fell in love with a boy. He infected me.

649
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,440
I need you to say it!

650
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,600
Say it! Say it, Mom!

651
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,680
"My 16-year-old daughter is HIV-positive."

652

[door grinds]

653
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,160
Do you regret tonight?

654
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,800
It was... intense.

655
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
But it was good.

656
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:47,880
Sure?

657
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,840
Good night.

658

[incoming text]

659
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,240
Good night, gorgeous.

660
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,760
I love you. I love you more than ever.

661
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:28,640
You! You get a scholarship,
and you thank us like this?

662
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,120
-Guzmán!
-Vandalizing the property of others?

663
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,400
-You disgust me!
-What's going on here?

664
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,680
And who are you? Unbelievable,
the riffraff we get here tonight!

665
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,680
Shall I take that as a compliment
or punch you?

666
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,040
Take it as you will.

667
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,360
-Let's go.
-I won't let this prep boy insult us.

668
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,600
I'm not insulting you,
just stating the facts.

669
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,560
One question.

670
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,880
What do you call people who keep millions
that don't belong to them,

671
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,880
so they can live the way you do?

672
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,400
Thieves, or simply bastards?

673
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,520
You dare come to this house
to insult me and my family.

674
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,640
Who do you think you are, fucking clown?
[Guzman grunts]

675
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,200
-What are you doing?
-Okay.

676
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,680
You don't deserve my brother!

677
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:07,920
[Guzman] Get off me!

678
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,440
Shove your money up your asses!

679
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,400
You! Hey! You are finished!

680
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,080
Tomorrow, everybody at school
will know you are a fucking criminal!

681
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:20,840
And forget about your scholarship.

682
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
Guzmán, please. Are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

683
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,480
[dog barking]

684
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,640
Does it hurt a lot?

685
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,320
Polo...

686
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,680
Why don't you go for a walk
and stop making a fool of yourself?

687
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,960
Go!

688
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:45,440
Guzmán,

689
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,200
don't take it out on Samuel,
he's a good person.

690
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,960
Let's see what the principal
says tomorrow.

691
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,800
Your sister is right.
Samuel is a good person.

692
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,520
Me, not so much.

693
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,960
If you say anything at school, you'll
force me to tell what I saw in the shower.

694
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,200
Thanks for inviting me.

695
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:08,520
Nadia.

696
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,160
Nadia, you win.

697
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,200
I spoke in the heat of the moment.
I won't tell on your friend.

698
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,080
Stay a little longer.

699
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,560
Let me show you we are worth the trouble.

700
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,560
You are too good
looking over your shoulder.

701
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,720
Teach me how to look at you.
I promise I'll be a fast learner.

702
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,400
What's going on, honey?

703
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,080
This one needs to be taken down
a peg or two.

704

706
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,720
Hey.

707
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,720
Do you plan to remain mute all night?

708
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,560
Had I known,
I wouldn't have stood up for you.

709
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,120
You are clueless, aren't you?
Do you know what I've done for you?

710
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,600
I had it under control,
and you had to come and screw it up.

711
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,080
And now I must clean up after you!

712
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,480
I was protecting you, asshole!
It's what I've been doing my whole life.

713
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,640
I never asked you for that!

714
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,720
Come on, Samu! I won't let those people,
who are a real cancer, laugh at you!

715
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,360
Your whole life you've been blaming them,
maybe you are the cancer.

Is Samuel home?

719
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,440
-Is Samuel here?
-He's sleeping.

720
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,400
He was up all night hugging the toilet.

721
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,480
Says it's hangover.

722
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,120
I think it's the panic of having
to go back to that fucking school.

723
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,040
He can come back, no problem.

724
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,640
That's what I came to tell him.
My brother won't say anything.

725
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,120
Very well.

726
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,120
Was there anything else?

727
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,920
Coffee, water, beer?

728
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,800
Sit down, if you want.

My letter of introduction.

Next time, finish it.

I liked what you said at the party.

734
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,920
You dared to shout what many of us think.
Or at least I do.

why she came all the way up to see me...

None like you, I can tell you that.

and I'll make you iron.

She wants you to go back to school.
