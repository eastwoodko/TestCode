7
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,040
I am HIV-positive.

That's not true, I do care.
It makes me like you even more.

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,000
Something huge happened to you
and you've overcome it.

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,040
It makes me want to know you
more than before.

13
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,120
Have I fixed it?
If not I'll keep trying until I do.

Congratulations, Nadia.

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
This exam deserves a ten.

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,080
Well, so did one of your classmates',

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,320
and you know
that here we grade on a curve, so...

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,520
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,720
Excuse me, on a what?

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,720
Haven't they explained this to you?
Let me show you. Look. [clears throat]

25
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,600
This curve maps human intelligence.

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,640
On one end is a minority
with low intellectual ability.

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,200
On the other, there is another minority...

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,880
which is extremely intelligent.

29
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
And the majority...

30
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,840
falls here in the middle.

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,840
Let's assume the class is
a sample of society.

32
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,640
There are those who have a ten,
and those with a zero.

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,240
The rest is distributed here.
There can never be two tens, or two zeros.

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,920
So the grades are assigned
before the exam.

35
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,520
That's right. If you're in the lower 20%,
you fail even if you did well.

36
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,520
-Damn, that's why I always flunk.
-Isn't that a bit unfair?

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,760
Guys, this prepares you for life.

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Out there, if you're in the lowest 20%,
you don't get anything.

39
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,760
And on the podium,
there can't be two people.

40
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,240
If you have any complaints,
come to my office hours.

You didn't even try the meat.

-How about dinner just for the two of us?
-You know that can't be.

No problem, I'll go on a diet, then.

Too bad,
I was really looking forward to it.

Shame. I am tired
of feeling like a dick with legs.

I am good for a lot more.

It's true. You're right.

about world hunger.

The truth is, I only go
because my father makes me.

for having sex with Marina.

74
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,000
She was 14, he 17.

75
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,520
I didn't expel anybody. He left.

but also my family.

and explain to them that you tried
to take my virginity,

95

to then mock me.

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,560
You didn't invite her, right?

317
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,760
Oh, Guzmán.

318
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,920
Please! She's not coming, of course.

319
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,640
What happened?
Did she give you the Muslim brush-off?

320
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
Great, isn't it?

321
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,440
Looks like we are all

Samuel García...

You're not on the list.

326
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,560
-I'm not invited?
-No.

327
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,160
What's wrong?

328
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,840
His name's not on the list.

329
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,240
Do you know who I am?

Gutsy, the hippie.
Not even I dare say that.

Marina, darling, we already said
you couldn't invite any friends.

332

Mom, he's not my friend.

333
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,920
He's my boyfriend.

334
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,840
Samuel, let's go.

335
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,840
-Where the fuck are you going?
-What are you doing?

336
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,280
Your tag's come out?

337
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Oh, he was going to return it!

338
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,840
[laughs] Try not to get it too dirty.

339
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,000
You are an asshole, Guzmán.

340
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,920
-Samuel.
-What?

341
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,400
Why did you make me come
 if I'm not invited?

342
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,880
I was mad that at the other party
you were used for my dad's pictures,

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,600
-and you--
-You are the one using me now.

I'm just an excuse to rebel
against your parents.

345
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,520
Look, I had imagined many times
the moment when we decided to be a couple.

346
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,680
Many times.

347
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,600
But it was never like this,
I can assure you.

348
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Do you have your time machine on you?

[crickets creaking]

I'm sorry.

352

Do you like me, Marina?

353
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,600
-If this is about the HIV you can--
-You don't know me.

354
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,680
Do you know what I thought when...

355
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,680
I found out Pablo had infected me?

356
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,680
That...

357
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,520
somehow that secret,
that thing we both shared...

358
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,600
would bring us together.

359
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,440
That thanks to the HIV...

360
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,520
we would always be together.

361

And then he left. Without saying goodbye.

Can I tell you a secret?

365
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,000
You can't travel in time.

366
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,480
Or change the past.
So why not stop looking back...

367
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,640
and start looking forward?

368

Don't think you're the only one

Hello.

Christian, right?
Polo hasn't talked about you.

382

-Do you like Las Encinas?
-Yes, actually, I do.

I don't think the school likes me.

I don't pass a single test, man.
And I do try.

-I want to be famous.

Good question.
The truth is I don't know yet.

Begoña, you're not up to date.
Nowadays they don't want to do something.

They just want to be somebody,

Christian, I think it's very good
that you want to be somebody important.

That shows ambition.

No.

475
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,360
It's much better to be constantly reminded
that you're good for nothing.

476
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,400
And that they don't expect
anything from you.

477
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,400
My mother is tired of showing off
the winery and now she wants to show us.

478
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,640
She wants to introduce us to some friends.

479
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,960
Shit, if they were famous, at least.
But I don't know any of them.

480
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,800
The whole room may not even
add up to 10.000 followers!

481
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,080
-They are waiting for us.
-With all due respect...

482
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,240
Fuck them!

483
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,200
Let's go to your apartment
and finish the party there. I'm hungry.

484
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,000
Come on!

485
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Marchioness, thank you very much.

486
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,960
It's been a pleasure.
I love your winery, it's the bomb.

487
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,440
-[Carla laughs]
-I'm leaving.

488
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,360
Thank you for the cava, marchioness!

[Christian] Come on!

493
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,800
Hey.

494
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,920
Why the hurry to see me?
What is it? Did you and Marina do it?

495
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,080
Careful, I don't want details.

496
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,640
How was your night?

497
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,800
More boring than yours, I'm sure. At home.

498
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,040
Omar, I know.

499
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,440
And I'm not the only one,
Guzmán also knows.

500
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,160
What I don't know
is why you haven't told me.

501
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,760
I only do it to make some money.
Don't freak out.

502
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,800
Do you charge?

503
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,360
Of course!
Did you expect me to do it for free?

504
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,120
An NGO, "Dealers without  Borders."

505
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,920
-What are you talking about?
-What are you talking about?

506
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,720
Omar, how could you get into that shit?

507
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,560
I told you, Samu.

508
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,400
You are not the only one
with friends at the new school.

509
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,480
Yeah, but those friends you made
will make you end up like my brother.

510
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,200
-Is that what you want?
-No.

511
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,560
-I want to make some money, that's all.
-Then go and serve burgers.

512
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,040
Like I do.

513
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,960
I should remind you that we took
our resumes to La Cabaña together.

514
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,280
But who did they call? Not the Muslim boy.

515
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,000
It's true, the Muslim boy
can only deal drugs, right?

516
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,480
No, it's not that.

517
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,080
-But that's easy for you to say.
-No, nothing's easy for me.

518
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,800
Nor for your sister.

519
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Look at where she is and where you are.

520
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,440
Why don't you fuck off
with your fucking girlfriend...

521
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
and leave me alone, huh?

522
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
[students chattering]

523
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Nice hijab.

524
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,240
I wish I could say the same
about your shades.

525
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,360
They're for the hangover.

526
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,480
So, did you have a good time?

527
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,880
Did you raise a lot of money?

528
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,200
It doesn't matter. It was all a farce.

529
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,280
-How come?
-Just marketing for my father's company.

530
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,280
I knew it.

531
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,560
And I participated, as usual.

532
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,760
It was also
so you would forgive me, Nadia.

533
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,800
If I were your father,
I wouldn't let you date me either.

534
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,200
Who said anything about dating?

535
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,040
Okay.

536
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,680
Friends, then.

537
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,680
I could use one,
I don't know if I have any left.

538
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,760
If you are trying to get me to pity you...

539
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,400
I'm not trying anything, Nadia.

540
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,680
There's no plan, no strategy.
I don't want you to forgive me.

541
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
I don't deserve it.

542
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,600
I don't deserve you.

543
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
Now you do.

544
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,680
[school-bell rings]

545
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,080
After...

546
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,680
a complaint during office hours,
I've decided to change the grades.

547
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,760
Nadia, you have a nine point five now.

548
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,040
Um, well...
I'd also like to file a complaint.

549
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,600
I've already decided.
No need to go over it.

550
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,200
I'm very sorry.

551
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,040
Besides, being second in your class
is no tragedy.

552
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,840
Let's continue...

553
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,520
What happened
on the afternoon of April 12, 2016?

554
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,240
And don't say you don't remember.

555
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,320
An incident took place.

556
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,240
A fight.

557
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,720
From what I know,
this was more of a beating.

558
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,880
Who was involved?

559
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,840
Pablo,

560
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,640
and other students from the school.

561
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,280
And why say nothing until now?

562
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,600
Because...

563
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,000
one of those students is my son.

564
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,120
Hey.

565
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,680
I'm sorry about last night, man.

566
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,040
I got to the party,
but saw you with other people...

567
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,560
I got bored and left.

-Don't you ever get tired of lying?
-What?

569
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,160
Do you think at this point
anybody cares if you are into guys?

570
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,440
-No.
-Ah.

571
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,680
Then why do you act so weird?

572
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,600
Why are you avoiding us?

Do you think you're the only one I lie to?
I've been lying for years!

-Years, I have a lot of practice!
-What are you talking about?

Ander, the tennis player.
It feels like my fucking last name!

-And why don't you leave it?

What about my parents?
All the money they've spent on me.

586
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,600
All those years of sacrifice, for nothing.

00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,160
I don't know where he is.

588
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,400
A neighbor saw him leaving this morning.

589
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,240

in the bathroom. Shall I call him?

You have to tell them who did this to you.

No. They did this
because I owe 40.000 bucks.

for owing 40.000 miserable euros?

to get that fucking money.

00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,840
[Nano pants]

633
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,240
Nano, I'm going to help you.

634
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:01,560
How?

635
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,200
For now I am happy
if you don't tell my brother, okay?

636
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,120
What's going on?

637
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,920
Nothing, a couple of...

638
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,560
beers too many, and they went to my head.

639
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,880
Let's go, he's a little drunk.

640
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,240
Yeah.

641
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,960
Let's go.

642
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,800
[door opens]

643
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,000
[Ventura] Nothing.
Nothing has been published anywhere.

644
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,720
There aren't any more news
in the newspapers. It's all YouTube clips.

645
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,120
-And fucking gossip.
-Well.

646
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,880
Don't worry, you did what you could.

647
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,360
I did, unlike others.

648
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,000
-What have I done now?
-The scene you made over your boyfriend?

649
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,200
He's a child.

650
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,840
Who's not ready to...

651
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,120
Who's not ready
to be in a relationship with you.

652
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,440
He knows, mom.

653
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,800
And he doesn't care.

654
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,360
He doesn't care how I got infected.
Or who I did it with.

655
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,480
Or what stupid things I've done.

656
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,240
He doesn't look at me
as if I had the plague.

657
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,600
The way you do.

658
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,760
Do you have complaints about us?

659
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,680
About how we deal with all the problems
you bring us, day in and day out?

660
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,520
All the ways you've found
to fuck with our lives?

661
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,120
[shouts] Why don't you leave her alone?

662
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,480
I did not expect this from you, Guzmán.

663
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,280
People surprise you.

664
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,600
I haven't seen her smile like this
in a long time.

665
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,720
So if she's happy with him,
it's not the end of the world.

666
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,920
That afternoon, you, Polo, and Guzmán
waited for Pablo to get out of class.

667
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,120
But that has no bearing
on what has happened.

668
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,560
Was Guzmán very angry?

669
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,400
He had just found out
that guy had infected his sister.

670
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,560
What did you do to him?

671
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,800
Hey, Pablito.

672
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,560
-[Guzman punches Pablo]
-[Pablo gasps]

673
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,240
He got a couple of punches.

674
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,560
Guzmán found out that his sister
was about to run away

675
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,160
with a boy that had impregnated her,
a boy like Pablo.

676
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,880
What if he confronted her
in a fit of rage and killed her?

677
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,080
He says he's incapable
of doing something like that.

678
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,800
That he barely touched Pablo.

679
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,200
Tell me the truth.

680
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,320
Is that true?

681
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,400
Guzmán!

682
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,800
It's true.

683
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,080
He barely touched him.
