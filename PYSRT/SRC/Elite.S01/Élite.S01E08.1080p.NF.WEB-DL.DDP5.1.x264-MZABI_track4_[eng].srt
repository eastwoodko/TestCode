[woman] On the first of June,
around 9:30 pm,

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,560
you entered the school swimming pool.
Marina was there.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,760
You had an increasingly heated argument...

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,640
until you picked up the trophy,

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,120
and hit her
on the back of the head with it.

[clock ticking]

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,360
She did not die instantly,
which means you left her there...

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,640
bleeding to death.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,120
This is what we believe happened,
and more importantly,

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,400
what the judge believes happened.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,400
Do you have anything to say
in your defense?

<i>Are you getting cold feet?</i>

21
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,480
Tell me about Morocco.

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,200
About Asilah. What is it like?

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,960

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,160
I was looking at
where I can get medication,

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,040
and there's a clinic nearby
where they need volunteers.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,600
I could help people
who have just been given their diagnosis.

32
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
I've been through that.

33

Okay.

Sorry, Nano, I'm just a little...

[sniffs] Do you think we're all right, eh?

44
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,960
This is the second time
our home has been broken into,

by people looking for who knows what,

00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,520
since you got out of the slammer.

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,560
[sighs] What a coincidence.

48
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,920
Your brother could have been killed.
Are you listening to me?

49
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
Your brother could have been killed.
I could have been killed!

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,640

-Don't be.

Ah.

00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,040
Of course.

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,400
Good. The sooner you have the money,
the sooner you'll be out of here.

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,640
Right?

I'm sick of lying to you. Of not being
able to look at you in the eyes.

-I swear that from now on--
-You will never lie to me again,

because I will never listen
to anything you say again.

You are no longer my brother.

70
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,240
It's just a small party
to celebrate the end of the school year.

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,800
Are you really not going to let me
say goodbye to my classmates?

72
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,880
I want you home
as soon as you get the grades.

Why won't you let her go?
She's done nothing wrong.

-She just wants to say goodbye.
-Mind your own business.

-Tired of--
-Of what?

79
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,160
Of your father?
The one who has given you life,

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,320
who raised you, fed you, and in return
you have only brought shame on him?

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Please, don't argue.
If I'm not allowed, then I won't go.

She only wants to say goodbye.

Fine.

So parents can go?

And brothers?

86
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,280
Since you're so eager to talk,
you will come.

87
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,920
That way you can apologize
to the principal.

-Me?
-Yes.

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,400
In this family, when you are wrong,
you apologize.

90
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,280
We will leave that school
with our heads high.

You went after my family,
you son of a bitch. That will cost you...

-You're the crazy one.

The way you're going, those documents
will end up in all the papers.

98
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,560
And you won't see a penny then.

99

I'm used to being penniless.
To living in the shit. What about you?

-It starts at seven.
-[father] We have nothing to celebrate.

Tomorrow morning,
we have an appointment with the doctor.

110

Now you have nothing to say?

Are you shitting me?
What do you mean you don't have it?

Did they search for it?

117

Of course,
they searched everywhere for it.

118

[Teodoro] No, we can't give in.

We have to put an end to this
or they will ruin our lives.

Have you really canceled
the trip to Croatia?

126

Somebody had to do it.

127

Or did you expect both our families
to travel together,

as if you and I were still a couple?

Polo, I'll ask you one more time.

134

Are you really going to let that guy
steal your girlfriend?

135
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't you see how she ignores me?
She won't listen.

136
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,400
So stop talking.

137
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,000
Show her that you love her.
Take action. Do something!

138
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Sure. It's so easy for you to say.

-How?
-Do I have to spell it out for you?

Guzmán... Can we talk?

141
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,240
I guess they will take advantage
of the party for Marina to sneak out.

142
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
With the money from the blackmail, right?

143
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,920
So what, your brother takes your share
and you just rat him out?

144
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,800
I don't give a crap about him.

145
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,400
But, believe it or not,
I do care about your sister.

146
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,000
-I don't know. She won't listen to me.
-Nor me. But you can do something.

147
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,280
You can talk to your parents,
they can nip it in the bud.

148
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,960
I could.

149
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
But I won't bother.

What do you mean?

151
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,560
She can move to the moon, if she wants to.
I'm sick of her.

152
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,920
Sick of looking after someone who wants
to jump off every cliff she sees.

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,400
Well, let her jump, then. If she survives,
she might learn something.

154
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,800
[Samu] She's your sister.

155
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
And she's the girl that screwed you over.
You, me, my entire family.

156
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,960
She stole from us, blackmailed us...
with the help of your brother.

157
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,360

471
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,080
[Carla] You won't say a word.

472
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,160
-Because you saw nothing.
-But I did! He killed Marina, damn it!

473
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,920
That would be covering up!

474
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,560
You wanted to be my boyfriend, right?
To be one of us.

475
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,600
For me to treat you like an equal.

476
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,680
Then you must know that, among us,
we always protect each other.

477
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,200
Like Polo did.

478
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,160
He did it for me.

479
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,320
And if you had opened that locker,
he wouldn't have had to do it.

480
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,080
You realize what you've done, right?

481
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,000
This is much more serious, damn it!

482
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,560
You want your Disney movie?

483
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,600
You've just had the break of your life.

484
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,760
Use it well.

485
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,360
Excuse me, are you Guzmán?

486
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,720
Yes.

487
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,080
-May we speak for a moment?
-Why me?

488
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,000
-Come with me, please.
-Where's my sister?

489
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,160
-Guzmán.
-Where's my sister?

490
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,520
-Calm down, Guzmán. Come with me.
-Where's my sister?

491
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,240
[shouting] I said, where's my sister?

492
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,000
-Calm down, Guzmán, please. Let's talk.
-Where is my sister? Damn it!

493
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,760
Polo.

494
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,000
Did you get rid of...?

495
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,200
Good.

496
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,480
They will realize. When they question me,
they will realize, I know it. [sobs]

497
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,840
-No, listen to me.
-[Polo sniffs]

498
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,920
You went home because you were very drunk.

499
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,400
Then, I texted you to come
because something serious had happened.

500
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,440
Repeat that.

501
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,400
Polo, repeat that.

502
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,280
I was very drunk and I went home.

503
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,480
My mothers had gone out for dinner.

504
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,760
Carla, my girlfriend, called and said
something terrible had happened.

505
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,920
Then, I went back to school.

506
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,360
-At what time did you leave the party?
-I don't know.

507
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,040
-Around nine, I think.
-And you went straight home?

508
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,480
Can anybody confirm
the time you got home?

509
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,440
There was nobody home.

510
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,600
Are there security cameras
in your housing complex?

511
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,120
Maybe we could check the footage
to confirm the time of your arrival.

512
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,480
Sorry, am I under suspicion?

513
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,600
No, these are routine checks,
nothing to worry about.

514
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,040
If the cameras confirm the time
you gave us, it will all be all right.

515
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,320
We are done.

516
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,600
Are you all right?

517
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,480
Is anything wrong?

518
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,120
Yes, yes...

519
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm fine.

520
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,480
[people chattering quietly]

521
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,720
Listen...

522
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,160
How about, later today,
we prepare the summer schedule?

523
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,760
No hurries.

524
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,440
It will take our minds off this.

525
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,280
I don't want to go to any championships.
I want to stay here this summer.

526
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,360
And I don't want to play tennis.

527
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,880
Losing a classmate is terrible.

528
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,840
I can't even imagine how you feel.

529
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,680
But life goes on, Ander.

530
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,800
And no matter how hard it is,
life must go on.

531
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
I know. And I want it to go on.

532
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,600
But I want <i>my life</i> to be the one
which goes on.

533
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
And I don't want
to play tennis again, Dad.

534
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,840
-[father takes a deep breath]
-It's over.

535
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,040
Over there.

536
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Thank you for coming. I love you.

537
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:05,560
When they check the cameras
they will know I arrived much later.

538
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,440
They will know I lied,
and they will catch me.

539
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,000
[sighs] Fuck, I never should have said
I went home. That was stupid.

540
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,520
-That was stupid.
-No. You were drunk.

541
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,360
It could have taken you longer
than you thought to get home, or whatever.

542
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,960
We can make something up.
I'm not going to let you end up in jail.

543
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,640
It was an accident.

544
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,840
Look at me.

545
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,520
What happened was an accident.

546
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,560
-And you can't pay for that.
-I killed her, Carla.

547
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
It was a fit of rage, you know me.
I didn't want to.

548
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,760
-Don't talk nonsense.
-I will pay for it.

549
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,440
We must keep a cool head.

550
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,000
[sighs] Why are you helping me?

551
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,000
Because you helped me,
and saved my family.

552
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,880
Listen to me. You and I are not together.

553
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,600
What's more, let's say we hate each other.

554
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,960
That would mean you had no motive
to kill Marina.

555
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,280
Why would you want the watch? You see?

556
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,800
It wouldn't make sense.
You'd have no motive.

557
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,640
Nobody will think it was you, okay?

558
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,040
We are not together.

559
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,520
Where's Marina? Why haven't they brought
her body already? I want to say goodbye.

560
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,640
-They need to perform an autopsy.
-I don't care what they have to do!

561
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,120
I want them to bring my daughter now!

562
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,240
-What is it? What are you looking at?
-Mom, that's enough.

563
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,320
[sobbing] Guzmán, where's Marina?

564
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,240
Where is she?

565
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,760
[sobbing]

566
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,280
-Omar, I'm off to the bank. Be right back.
-All right.

567
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,920
We have ten minutes, right?

568
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,440
I'll cover for you. Until Dad gets back.

569
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,760
Come on.

570
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
I can't stop thinking
about that poor girl.

571
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,040
I don't know what I would have done
if it had been you.

572
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,600
Dad, I'm all right.

573
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,640
I never liked that school.

574
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,080
[sighs]
What does the school have to do with it?

575
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,520
-That could have happened anywhere.
-Do you still want to go?

576
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,640
Fine.

577
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,640
If you want to go back next year, you can.

578
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,800
But I don't want to hear
about that boy again.

579
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,720
I don't want you to go near him.

580
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,640
I don't want you to do anything but study.

581
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,760
You can go back.

582
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,440
But only on that condition.

583
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,040
No.

584
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,400
If I go back,
it will be with no conditions.

585
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,000
If I go back,
it will be as just a normal student.

586
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,080
I don't know if anything will happen
with Guzmán,

587
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,200
or with another one.
Or if nothing will happen at all.

588
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,200
But if I go back,
it will be without conditions.

589
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,080
You see? See how they've changed you?

590
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,560
Dad, maybe I haven't changed.

591
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,200
Maybe the old me wasn't me.

592
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,920
It was a girl who tried
to please her parents above all.

593
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,000
Maybe I'm different.

594
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,120
Like your sister?

595
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,080
No.

596
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,600
I don't know who I am yet.

597
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,120
But I'm going to find out.

598
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,920
I hope you and Mom
can accept that, and love me.

599
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,440
But I'm going to be myself, Dad. Myself.

600

602
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,360

<i>She did not die instantly.</i>

611

<i>Which means you left her there,</i>

you don't have a shred of evidence.
Nothing.

It's him.

You're under arrest

-What are you saying?
-Hold him tight.

What the fuck are you saying?
What the fuck are you saying?

624
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,520
-Grab him.
-What the hell are you saying?

625
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Look at me in the face and say it again!

We have a witness. Your brother.

00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,160
A motive.

628
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,560
As her messages prove, she had changed
her mind about running away.

629
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,880
That's why you killed her.

630
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,480
[sobbing]
Samu! You know I'd never hurt Marina.

631
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,160
-[policewoman] Get him!
-You know I'd never hurt Marina, Samu!

632
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,200
They killed her for that watch. The pen
drive had a load of dirt on her father,

633
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,880
and we wanted money for it.

634
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,000
But those people are nasty. They broke
into my house, assaulted my brother.

635
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,200
Come on! Look at me in the face!

636
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,800
Marina had... she had that watch.
Somebody killed her and took it.

637
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,480
[Nano]<i> One of those rich fucks.</i>
<i>The little marchioness, for example.</i>

638
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,240
<i>-She stood to lose the most.</i>
<i>-</i>[policewoman]<i> We don't have the watch.</i>

639
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,160
<i>Or any proof of blackmail.</i>

640
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,120
[Nano] <i>You have the cell phone</i>
<i>I used to talk to that guy.</i>

641
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,280
[policewoman]
<i>You have no proof of what you're saying.</i>

642
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,400
[Nano] <i>Of course, I'm the one who needs</i>
<i>proof to accuse those rich kids.</i>

643
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,440
Breakfast is served.

644
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,560
[clock ticking]

645
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,800
Darling, are you all right?

646
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,400
I'm fine.

647
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,320
Or I will be.

648
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,240
It's all over.

649
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,040
Come on, they've made pancakes,
and they are positively yummy.

650
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,280
[ticking]

651
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,520
[policewoman] Do you have anything to say
in your defense?

652
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,280
Yes.

653
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,920
Go to hell.

654
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,920
We can get this to go, and go home.

655
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,440
You've had enough.

656
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,120
Son of a bitch!

657
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,240
If you hadn't come to our school,
none of this would have happened.

658
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,760
-Is it my fault?
-Your murderer brother's and yours.

659
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,560
Because you introduced them, right?

660
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,360
Live with that.

661
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,440
No. You could have stopped it,
and you did nothing.

662
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,200
You sat back and did nothing,
so if you're looking for a guilty party,

663
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,600
-look in the fucking mirror!
-What do you mean?

664
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,240
[Lu] Hey, no! Enough, Guzmán!

665
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,480
For your own good, don't even think
of returning to our school, you hear?

666
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,080
You have been told so many times
you own the world,

667
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,440
that you even believe it, right?

668
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,400
See you in class, Lucrecia.
That's<i> if</i> they let you go back.

669
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,680
Guzmán!

670
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,920
What are you doing there?
Can you get down, please?

671
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,040
Samuel was right.

672
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,080
If I had talked to my parents,
or to Marina, she would be alive.

673
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:12,440
No... The only person to blame here
is the one who killed her. Nobody else.

674
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,480
My sister is dead.

675
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,880
I know, sweetie.

676
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,480
And I know it hurts a lot.

677
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,480
I know because...

678
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,320
if something happened to you, I would die.

679
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,120
And so would your parents.

680
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,520
So please...

681
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,440
don't cause any more pain, will you?

682
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,680
And get down from there now!

683
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:43,840
I need to hold you.

684
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,920
Come on.

685
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,720
Guzmán! Please.

686
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,000
Come on.

687
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,800
Do something like this again, and I swear
I'll kill you myself, you hear me?

688
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
Thank you.

689
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,640
You're always there.

690
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,280
Where else would I be?

691
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,000
I need you.

692
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,400
No.

693
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,680
I need you, Lu.

694
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:57,560
CARLA: <i>Are you coming?</i>
<i>We're waiting for you.</i>

695
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,360
[Samu] It's my fault.

696
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,040
They arrested my brother because of me.

697
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,400
I was so mad at him,
I thought he was capable of killing her.

698
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,560
-You are not to blame for anything.
-I accused him.

699
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,320
-And he's not guilty.
-I know.

700
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,200
There must be a way to prove
it wasn't him.

701
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,280
Even if we had seen the murderer
with our own eyes,

702
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,720
who would believe us, Samu?

703
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,000
-It wouldn't do any good.
-Christian, I need your help.

704
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,960
He's my brother and your best friend.
We need to do whatever we can.

705
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,280
There must be some evidence, something.
You have to help me.

706
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,920
[cell phone beeps]
