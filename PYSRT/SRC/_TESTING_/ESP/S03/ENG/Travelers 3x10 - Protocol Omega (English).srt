1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,928
- _
- Come on.

2
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,558
You're having fun with this one?

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,809
Okay.

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,859
And then he... he very
quickly realizes that

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,860
the cup is nowhere near big enough,

6
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,109
but he can't stop at this point.

7
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,069
And so there he is,
he's stuck in traffic,

8
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,614
and he's peeing into a coffee cup.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:36,411
And the level is slowly rising.

10
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,832
... continue to search for answers

11
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,752
in the wake of the worst
nuclear attack in history,

12
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,755
which shook the lives of hundreds
of thousands of people on Tuesday.

13
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,999
There's been no information

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,030
as to which terrorist
group is responsible...

15
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,980
- Synced & corrected by MementMori -
-- www.addic7ed.com --

16
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,826
Thanks.

17
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,164
- Shit's gotten pretty crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,800
Always figured Omega
was the one protocol

19
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,660
we'd never have to worry about.

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,173
When you consider the amount
of potential revisions

21
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,967
and possible outcomes,

22
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,137
the Director's probably abandoned
millions of timelines.

23
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,260
Good chance there's a version
of us in most of them.

24
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,726
- Yeah, but I live in this one, so...
- Yeah.

25
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,353
Yeah.

26
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,650
What's that thing stuck to your head?

27
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,527
Brain implant.

28
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,948
- For?
- Temporal aphasia. Early onset.

29
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,241
Cool.

30
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:44,164
We'll file the missing
person's report in 24 hours.

31
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,833
It will have been given by
3569 after she's gone home.

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,652
He didn't come home from work.
That's all she needs to know.

33
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,218
- We'll take care of the rest.
- I'll tell her.

34
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,437
They'll blame us, you know that.

35
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,899
I'm surprised Yates
hasn't called already.

36
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,026
I should probably go into the office.

37
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,487
- Can you tell her it was Faction?
- I did.

38
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,241
But after this, they're never
gonna trust a word we say.

39
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,077
Yeah. After this, I'm
not sure I blame them.

40
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,972
Yeah, I still get locked
in once in a while.

41
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,859
The device is just a temporary solution.

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,860
There's no cure even in the future.

43
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,252
Switch hosts enough times,
it becomes inevitable.

44
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,579
So you've switched
hosts that many times?

45
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,590
Yeah.

46
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,467
I was an early test subject
for consciousness transfer.

47
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,304
So, you're like really old, then.

48
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,681
Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty fucking old.

49
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,859
I'm not even sure what
I'm supposed to do now.

50
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,771
What do you mean?

51
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,899
I'm a cop? That's it?

52
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,526
It was fine as Protocol
5, but I'm a doctor.

53
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,154
- We still have a mission.
- Do we?

54
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,366
Maybe the Director
abandoned this timeline,

55
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,825
but that doesn't mean we have to.

56
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,495
We can't just go around
making up our own missions.

57
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,579
Why not?

58
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,374
Because it would make us no
different than the Faction.

59
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,419
Then we still have a mission
to complete. Find 001.

60
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,099
And how are we supposed to do that?

61
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,100
He could've jumped into anyone by now.

62
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,710
- Without the Director's help...
- I don't know. I just...

63
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,637
We... We have to try.

64
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,557
I'm gonna take off now.

65
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,810
You're bleeding.

66
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,690
- Mm, shit.
- Here.

67
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,651
- I can bandage you up.
- No, no, no.

68
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,070
- Y-You don't gotta.
- Just come here.

69
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,238
Come here.

70
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,630
What?

71
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,304
I'm just so sorry, that's all.

72
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,266
Can I ask you something?

73
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,936
Whatever. Sure.

74
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,232
The future hasn't gotten
any better, has it?

75
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:21,237
- Protocol 2, Marcy.
- Protocol Omega, Jeff.

76
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,531
Truth?

77
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,786
Nothing the Director's done has
made one bit of difference.

78
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,094
But I still think that
we can change that.

79
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:40,298
Hey, how about if I finish up? Yeah?

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Okay.

81
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,852
- Where you headed?
- Home.

82
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,272
- I'll give you a lift.
- No. You're just gonna wanna talk.

83
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,984
- It's good to talk.
- I already know what you're gonna say

84
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,948
because I've been trained
to say the same thing.

85
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,319
And you'll feel better
because we're told

86
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,679
that it helps people, but it doesn't.

87
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,283
- Marcy.
- David...

88
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,998
David was the kind of man who
made humanity worth saving. He...

89
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,959
He literally represented that.

90
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,423
And he's a better human being than
every fucking person in this room.

91
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:27,095
And the Director did
nothing to save him.

92
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,889
So I'm done.

93
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,732
You want me to go after her,
make sure she gets home okay?

94
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,237
No. Let her go.

95
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,409
Agent MacLaren.

96
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,162
Officer Conniker.

97
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,332
- Thank you for the rescue.
- You stay in touch.

98
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,127
I will.

99
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,847
Sir...

100
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,535
I have reason to believe
that yesterday's attacks

101
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,185
were not caused by the Travelers.

102
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,664
Well, then I have reason to
believe you're one of them.

103
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,857
There is a resistance
group called the Faction.

104
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,775
Oh, I know all about the
Faction, believe me.

105
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,652
That is their political distinction.

106
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,463
It doesn't change the fact
that the uranium used

107
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,030
in every single one of those nukes

108
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,033
had just been traced back to the
exact same mine in this country.

109
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,370
I was there with Agent
MacLaren and his team

110
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,997
when he disarmed the fourth device.

111
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,916
Okay, so we're supposed to convince
the Russians and the Chinese

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,586
that although every one of the
nukes that went off yesterday

113
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:42,879
has been traced back to us,

114
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,699
the one that was successfully disarmed

115
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
just happened to be on U.S. soil?

116
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,379
'Cause the good Travelers saved us

117
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,968
from the bad Travelers, is that it?

118
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,721
Does that sound like a
compelling argument?

119
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,098
No.

120
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,621
Every one of the groups we're
monitoring keeps saying the same thing.

121
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,022
"Protocol Omega." What is it?

122
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,110
- I'll ask MacLaren.
- Find another way. I don't trust them.

123
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,050
Get it right, please.

124
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,448
Right now, we're one nervous
general away from nuclear war.

125
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,059
Do you ever think about
what you would've done

126
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,461
if you hadn't volunteered
for the Traveler program?

127
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,341
No. Never saw myself
doing anything else.

128
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,717
Yeah, me, too.

129
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,931
But I'm not sure I'd
make the same decision,

130
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,015
knowing what I know.

131
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,976
- There was another option?
- Yeah. Life.

132
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:44,148
Life not solely devoted
to training and combat.

133
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,485
Life without Protocol 4.

134
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:51,280
Stuck in domes, heated
by a failing reactor,

135
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,324
on a diet of yeast and recycled water?

136
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,077
We were barely clinging to
life, Carly, not living it.

137
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,163
Yeah, well, tell that to
my mother and sisters.

138
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,875
They still found a way
to laugh every day,

139
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:08,047
fall in love, make families.

140
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,177
Hey, at least you still got
your wife to go home to.

141
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,672
Traveler team report to the
following coordinates immediately:

142
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,823
47.2531 degrees north,
122.4523 degrees west.

143
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,161
What the hell was that?

144
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,247
One way to find out.

145
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,832
- You can't be serious.
- Why not?

146
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,269
You know for a fact that that
message wasn't from the Director.

147
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,979
It's obviously a trap
set up by the Faction.

148
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,921
And if the Faction is working with 001?

149
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,798
Then we're the next ones
behind a brick wall.

150
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,174
We'll take precautions.

151
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,805
Carly, what the hell else
are we supposed to do?

152
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,637
Literally anything else.

153
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,098
We can do whatever we want.

154
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,685
I can't order you to go
with me, but I'm going.

155
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,750
Trevor, are you there?

156
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,483
I could use your help.

157
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,592
Coverage continues today of
the deadly terrorist attack

158
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,744
that took place in...

159
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:22,246
Nearly 48 hours since
the initial attack,

160
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,914
very few questions have been answered.

161
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:26,125
The authorities administrated...

162
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,537
- Hey, Trev?
- Yeah, bud?

163
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,332
Where's Marcy?

164
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,417
She left a while ago.
It's just you and me.

165
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,631
So, Marcy went home?

166
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,093
Why don't we meditate for
20 minutes? Clear our heads.

167
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,343
Hi, this is David Mailer.
Please leave a message.

168
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,254
Hey, taxi!

169
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,915
Marcy?

170
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,384
Oh, my God.

171
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,946
Philip, what are you doing here?

172
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,865
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,368
Okay, just...

174
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,211
Go into the living room.
I'll be right there.

175
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,617
Carly, you got anything?

176
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,678
Nothing yet.

177
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,641
Hold up. One man walking
out from the boat.

178
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:16,355
Agent MacLaren. I'm pleased
you were able to make it.

179
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,398
Okay.

180
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,779
Do the names "Vincent Ingram"

181
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,440
or "Katrina Perrow"
mean anything to you?

182
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,623
Just wanna have a conversation.

183
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,292
Oh, you better start talking

184
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,519
'cause you've got about ten seconds

185
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,740
before I order your head blown off.

186
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,715
- I wanna cut a deal.
- Eight seconds.

187
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,302
I will turn myself in to the
Director and face the consequences

188
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,972
if you will fill me in on the
details of Protocol Omega.

189
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,600
Fill you in?

190
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,188
It was not a protocol in
the time I was sent back.

191
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,773
Really?

192
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,766
That's what you're going with?

193
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,698
Yates, is this you?

194
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:19,209
- How did you know?
- Seriously?

195
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:22,755
Why didn't you just give him an
eye patch and a cat to stroke?

196
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,814
I need you to come talk to my superiors.

197
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,052
They're my superiors, too.
Why not just text me?

198
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,972
Because they don't trust you. Three
nuclear devices just went off.

199
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,476
And you watched us disarm the fourth.
How could you possibly... ?

200
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,479
You know what? Fine. Let's go.

201
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,608
- All of them. Including the sniper.
- Uh, no.

202
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,320
Carly, you and Trevor head back
in my car. This won't take long.

203
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,737
Copy that.

204
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,576
Happy to go with, boss.

205
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,038
This is my Protocol 5, remember?

206
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,083
Okay, fine.

207
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,801
- Who did you get to play the messenger?
- Johanson's kid.

208
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,636
Wants to be an actress.

209
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,346
She's good.

210
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,611
So I would recommend not
doing this to someone.

211
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,069
But make a claw with your
left hand, like this.

212
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,005
And then so when you come down...

213
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,031
- Oh! Shit.
- Oh.

214
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,325
Ah.

215
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,221
Now you can't expect
beginner's luck to last.

216
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,245
- Gin.
- I didn't...

217
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,143
That's your shirt.

218
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,566
- Ah, well, rules are rules. All right.
- That's your shirt.

219
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,877
Oh, man.

220
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,713
Whoo.

221
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,631
- Aw.
- Right?

222
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,452
- All right, one more round and then...
- Okay. Keep going.

223
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,156
Philip.

224
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,660
Hey, Philip. Hey.

225
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:18,786
Hey.

226
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,924
You saw something in the
bathroom, didn't you?

227
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,967
I would never do that.
You know that, right?

228
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,345
I don't really.

229
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,959
I know you don't wanna
rely on the drugs,

230
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,974
but if those pills are helping,

231
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,480
- you need to keep taking them.
- I can't. I threw them away.

232
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
And only an archivist can give me more.

233
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:52,112
Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.

234
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,491
Hey, please... please
take care of yourself.

235
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,951
Yeah.

236
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,923
David was a really good guy.

237
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,302
Excuse me, what are you doing in... ?

238
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,987
What are you doing?

239
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,406
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

240
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,076
Carly!

241
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,139
Renovations?

242
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,641
- Everything needs to be hard-wired.
- Because?

243
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,977
We've built our version of
what you call an S.T.A.,

244
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,313
Space Time Attenuation field generator.

245
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,191
I'm told it'll make it impossible
for the Director to see us.

246
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,943
It's under guard on the floor below

247
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,629
if you're thinking of
looking for the off switch.

248
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,614
That precaution really wasn't necessary.

249
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,539
Director Stevenson, it's
an honor to meet you.

250
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,203
Turn off your comm device.

251
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,370
My comm?

252
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,374
Okay.

253
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,960
- It's off.
- Good.

254
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,842
Jesus! Okay, okay, okay.

255
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,302
It's off.

256
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,639
Give me one reason I shouldn't
round up every one of you.

257
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,859
The nuclear devices were
built by the Faction.

258
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,580
They're still out there.

259
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,897
Protocol Omega, what does it mean?

260
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,525
It means the Director will no longer
be intervening in this timeline.

261
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,403
- What does that mean?
- No more messengers, no more missions.

262
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,199
Those who are part of
the Traveler program

263
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,405
are free to live out their days,

264
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,492
such as they are, as they see fit.

265
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,221
- Why would the Director do that?
- It's impossible to say for sure.

266
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,454
Venture a guess.

267
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,289
It could mean that we've succeeded

268
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,000
and we're now on the optimal
path to a better future.

269
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,562
It could also mean there's no
possible way of saving the future

270
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,754
no matter what you do.

271
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,215
That's true.

272
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,978
Why should we believe
a word you're saying?

273
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,996
That's your call, sir.

274
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,305
But I'm willing to help in any way I can

275
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,767
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

276
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:35,544
Jeff.

277
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,339
Hey, just wanna check in on you,

278
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,882
see how's it going.

279
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,969
I brought you something.

280
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,182
It's water flavoring made of leaves.
You just add boiling water.

281
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,102
Yeah, yeah, I know what tea is.

282
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,991
I've developed quite a
taste for it myself.

283
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,313
Hmm.

284
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,736
Uh, do you wanna come in
and have a cup with me?

285
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,863
If... If that would be cool.

286
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,026
- But I don't wanna...
- Come on. Come in.

287
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,250
Take a seat.

288
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,432
Looks like you've been
doing some cleaning.

289
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,589
Yeah, just trying to keep busy.

290
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,676
I'll be okay. I just need
some time, you know?

291
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,596
Time, yes.

292
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,308
Don't we all?

293
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,689
I know what you've been through, Marcy.

294
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,859
You do?

295
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,446
Well, not everything.

296
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,200
I can't imagine what it must
have been like for you,

297
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,079
to go through your reset,
to lose all those memories.

298
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,377
The Director took my wife from me, too.

299
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,340
You mean your... your
wife in the future.

300
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,884
Death by messenger.

301
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,344
Just like David.

302
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,684
Precious life, snuffed out
right before my eyes.

303
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,315
But we have no right to complain.

304
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,151
We forfeited that right

305
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:29,032
when we made the decision to put our
fate in the hands of a machine.

306
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,162
Um, I'm sorry you went through all that.

307
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,917
Is another reset possible, I wonder?

308
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,507
Is Ellis's backdoor code to the Director

309
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,260
still buried in there somewhere?

310
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,555
I don't think so.

311
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,515
Oh, I think so.

312
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,517
I really do.

313
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:07,487
Anyway, it's... it's just good
to see you whole again, Marcy.

314
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,158
I should get that.

315
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,950
Let me help you.

316
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,337
Guys!

317
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,048
001 went into Jeff!

318
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,359
He's after Ellis's backdoor code.

319
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,360
He thinks... He thinks it's in my head.

320
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,637
Guys, I need your help!

321
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,605
Marcy?

322
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,732
Mac, Trevor? Can anyone here me?

323
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,235
Sorry, I must've got
locked in for a sec.

324
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,697
I didn't catch it all,
but Marcy's in trouble.

325
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,947
Meet me at her place.

326
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,037
Ah!

327
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,535
Ugh. Mac, I have 001.

328
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,497
The gun isn't loaded, Marcy.

329
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,337
I could never risk what's
in that pretty little head.

330
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,214
Ugh.

331
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,509
Take her.

332
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,304
It's the end of the world, brother.
We're all gonna die now.

333
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:03,538
Before I agree to let you do anything,
I wanna know about the future.

334
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,910
I can only tell
you about the time I left.

335
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:08,293
It's changed because
you changed history.

336
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,129
Not necessarily for the better.

337
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,775
From what little I've heard,
even after all we've done,

338
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,010
humanity is still on the
brink of extinction.

339
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,387
A more recent Traveler might
be able to tell you more.

340
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,725
Just tell me the history you
remember. What went wrong?

341
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,563
The decline took years, but this
decade was the turning point.

342
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:33,943
Once climate change became
unstoppable, it led to mass migration,

343
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,364
severe overpopulation in
urban centers, famine.

344
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,283
Ancient diseases became
unlocked as polar ice melted,

345
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:44,037
which exposed humanity to viruses
for which we had no immunity.

346
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:49,000
That led to mass death, collapse
of governments, resources,

347
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,086
war over what was left.

348
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,547
Eventually, nuclear winter.

349
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,053
How the hell were you
supposed to stop all that?

350
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,595
Our primary mission

351
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,140
was to prevent a massive
asteroid strike in the Atlantic.

352
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,224
Helios.

353
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,731
When an x-ray laser's fired toward
a previously undiscovered asteroid

354
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,858
from within the continental
United States,

355
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,610
now that tends not to go unnoticed.

356
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:19,239
We should prove our good
intentions. Helios killed millions.

357
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,950
The Grand Plan was supposed
to erase all that.

358
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,702
- Why didn't it work?
- I honestly can't answer that.

359
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,621
Only that the Director kept trying.

360
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:28,872
Till today.

361
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,423
Agent MacLaren, today, this country's
been accused by my counterparts

362
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,717
in Russia, China, even by our allies,

363
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,386
of detonating nuclear
devices on their soil.

364
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,346
I told you that was the Faction.

365
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,758
- They don't know that.
- Well, then let me tell them.

366
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,518
Let me tell them everything.
We can still fix this.

367
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,606
I can reach out. We'll need
to arrange translators.

368
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,650
That won't be necessary.

369
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,120
Carly, I'm at the apartment.

370
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,831
I'm still a few minutes
out. Is she there?

371
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:13,001
No. And the place is trashed.

372
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,420
Oh, God. Marcy, can you hear me?

373
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,629
Say that again.

374
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,842
Come in, Marcy. Marcy, you there?

375
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
Ah, shit.

376
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,059
I found her comm. It's been cut out.

377
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,852
He's taken her.

378
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,316
You said you didn't catch it all.
What did you hear her say?

379
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,943
Something about Ellis's backdoor code.

380
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,315
What good is the code without
access to the Director?

381
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:45,658
Boss, we got a problem.

382
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,245
Philip, Mac's turned off his comm.

383
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,330
Okay, I'm close to his house.
I'll try to find him.

384
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,745
Carly, meet me out front. I
know where they're going.

385
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,464
Marcy, I'm sorry.

386
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,009
I thought the Director would
stop them. They drugged me.

387
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,970
Grace, what did you tell them?

388
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,679
Boss, are you here?

389
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:10,141
Oh, okay.

390
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,937
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh.

391
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,107
That's good, huh?

392
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,380
Uh, I'm... I'm gonna...

393
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,883
I'm just gonna... gonna go.

394
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,978
What is the number of
Travelers in my country?

395
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:59,941
Each Traveler team is
forbidden by our protocols

396
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,864
to communicate with each
other unless directed.

397
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,655
We have captured several
Traveler cells in Russia.

398
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,867
They told us this Faction
originated in the United States.

399
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,959
They first came en masse

400
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,980
from the future to the U.S., yes,

401
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:18,376
but they have since spread
out to many countries.

402
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,859
Having consolidated their
power in your country.

403
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,133
- My team is on their way.
- Protocol Omega.

404
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,303
Why do you think that this
code is still in my head?

405
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,098
Actually, Grace told me.

406
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,702
Even told me how to use
it to hack the Director.

407
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,104
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- What if she's wrong?

408
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,291
Then nothing happens,
and I'm disappointed.

409
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,067
But if she's right, the Director
becomes permanently disabled

410
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,403
and the future belongs to humanity.

411
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,614
- Oh, you mean the Faction?
- Yes.

412
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,783
- Led by you?
- So I'm told.

413
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:56,205
This reset will take away all
those painful memories, Marcy.

414
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,834
Memories of who I am now.

415
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,296
The Director allowed the man
that you love to die horribly

416
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:04,964
when it could have saved him.

417
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,925
How can you forgive that?

418
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,481
By doing this, we'll
both get what we want.

419
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,898
All right, let's get this over with.

420
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,444
Don't shoot her!

421
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,617
You want what's in my head?

422
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,702
You can't have it.

423
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,705
No!

424
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,530
The other way is gonna
take so much longer.

425
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,577
Travelers will cooperate, I promise you.

426
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,514
We can even help find
members of the Faction

427
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,998
responsible for the nuclear devices.

428
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,709
Then will you share your
advanced technologies?

429
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,839
Our engineers have been
creating materials and...

430
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
and building devices for a decade.

431
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,632
I think if our technology
is shared equitably, we...

432
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,884
Sir, we're making progress.

433
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,612
This isn't the time to
be negotiating access

434
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,316
to future technologies
with foreign powers.

435
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,640
If we're to trust each other, we...

436
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,936
- What is happening?
- They're being overwritten.

437
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,397
- The Director's not doing this...
- Then who is?

438
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,250
I don't know. But it's impossible...

439
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,151
... for the Director to
take life in that way.

440
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,234
Stevenson.

441
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,779
When did this happen?

442
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,201
All right, keep me up to date.

443
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,839
The president and most of his cabinet

444
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,380
just screamed in pain and collapsed.

445
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,705
Oh, my God.

446
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,542
They all claim to be fine now. This
happened to the Speaker as well.

447
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,418
This is a coup.

448
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,797
I need to get back to Washington.
Arrest this son of a bitch.

449
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,424
Put your hands on your head.

450
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,967
- Jo, you gotta believe me.
- Now!

451
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,574
- Listen to me.
- Shut the fuck up.

452
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,417
The same thing that
happened to the president

453
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,120
is probably happening to other
world leaders right now.

454
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,204
Let me help you.

455
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,301
I need to talk to my team.

456
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,907
Guys, it's me, what's happening?

457
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,476
Where the fuck have you been?
001's taken Jeff as a host.

458
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:04,976
No.

459
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,419
The rescue was just a set
up to get access to Marcy.

460
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,481
Why Marcy?

461
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,317
So he could use Ellis's backdoor
code against the Director.

462
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,739
Through Ilsa. He's taken her to Filmore.

463
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,987
Yeah, that's our guess, too.

464
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,342
- We're almost there.
- Boss, I could use a pick up.

465
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,326
Okay, I'll get you on the way.

466
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,619
You're not going anywhere.

467
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,889
Guys, am I the only one seeing this?

468
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,683
_

469
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,853
No. We see it, too.

470
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,274
You need to get out.

471
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,063
I have to go see my son.
Filmore's not far from here.

472
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,778
Carly, there isn't much time.

473
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,156
I know. Go.

474
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,457
Boss, Carly's out.

475
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,418
Protocol Omega. I'll
meet you at Filmore.

476
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,095
Yes, ma'am.

477
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,267
I'll try and get the Director to safety.

478
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,354
NORAD's detected a
massive missile strike

479
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,691
from both Russia and China.

480
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,266
Tell me why this is happening.

481
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:38,487
The first ever Traveler 001
has taken over in the future.

482
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,655
Don't ask me how.

483
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,115
- He launched the missiles?
- No.

484
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,118
That would likely be the generals
following standing orders to launch

485
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,971
in the event their
leadership was overwritten.

486
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,538
But he is still the cause.

487
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,123
NORAD said we were targeted.

488
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,541
Jo,

489
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:56,172
you can either come with me or
you can shoot me in the back.

490
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,633
Bye, Marce.

491
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,636
I'm sorry.

492
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,138
Trevor! What are you doing?

493
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,917
001 must have uploaded his
consciousness into Ilsa.

494
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,669
No, he's not in there.

495
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,755
Grace.

496
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,339
Grace, hey.

497
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,887
He wasn't able to use the
backdoor code either.

498
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:31,350
Marcy... took that from him.

499
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:45,947
Then where is he?

500
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,118
Ugh. He's everywhere.

501
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,201
I don't understand.

502
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,333
001 transferred his
consciousness first into Ilsa,

503
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,667
and then out to the Internet.

504
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,999
By now, he's parsed
himself into computers

505
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,211
and servers all over the world,

506
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,173
just waiting for the future to arrive,

507
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,841
and then he can take over.

508
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,346
I didn't think it would
matter if I said anything.

509
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,390
I just thought the
Director would stop him.

510
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,727
I just was waiting.

511
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,187
He won.

512
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:19,815
What?

513
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,693
Then why did we come here?

514
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,861
I'm sorry, Jo.

515
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,155
It's over.

516
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:34,997
Maybe not.

517
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,848
Maybe everything we need to fix
this is right here in front of us.

518
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,004
Maybe the Director is just
expecting us to see it.

519
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,066
How many timelines are
you seeing right now?

520
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,175
Just one. The only one left.

521
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,471
And it's gonna end unless
one of us goes back.

522
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,597
Back in time?

523
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,159
Whoa. Guys, even if one of us was able

524
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,976
to upload their consciousness into Ilsa,

525
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,997
and even if Ilsa had the
electrical and processing power...

526
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,147
Which it does.

527
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,524
The Director's made sure of that

528
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,235
by downloading the program into
Ilsa in the middle of the night.

529
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,321
Even then, we could only send
someone to a point in time

530
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,645
after the most recent Traveler.

531
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:12,159
No, from 431 years in the future,
that's true, absolutely,

532
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,370
but not from now.

533
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,319
The amplitude of space-time distortion

534
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,720
is directly proportional to distance.

535
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,588
How far back could one safely
go from this point in time?

536
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,672
Twenty years, easy.

537
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,217
All we need to do is go
back before 001 arrived.

538
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,018
That's why the Director's been silent.

539
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,613
Because it knew we would think of this,

540
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,557
and it sent us what we
would need to do it.

541
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:40,146
I'm sorry, I do love this idea,
but we'd still need a TELL.

542
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,357
It's a time, elevation,
latitude and longitude

543
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,568
to send a consciousness
into a specific host.

544
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,112
You can't just guess.
It has to be exact.

545
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:53,242
August 18th, 2001, Whytecliff
Park, exactly 3:00 p.m.

546
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,663
When and where my host met Kat.

547
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,540
Okay.

548
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,210
And I have one last objection,
but it's a big one.

549
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,673
If this works, I'll be
ending Grant MacLaren's life

550
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,925
17 years before his
historical death, I know.

551
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,550
But maybe I can give those
years back to someone else.

552
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,647
So...

553
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,651
until we meet again.

554
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,779
That's a very interesting possibility.

555
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,409
Well...

556
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,996
if we're gonna do this,

557
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,833
hurry the fuck up.

558
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,599
I'll find the coordinates to Whytecliff

559
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,240
and the IMEI of MacLaren's cell phone.

560
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,139
Trevor, help me load the program.

561
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,803
- See, Jo? There's still hope.
- Hope?

562
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,847
Mac,

563
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,017
you did this.

564
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,189
You people didn't stop the
collapse of civilization.

565
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,941
If anything, you sped it up.

566
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,405
Where are you going?

567
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,702
To look at the sky.

568
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,798
Beautiful view, isn't it?

569
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,091
- Oh, God.
- Sorry. Ha-ha.

570
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,551
Didn't mean to sneak up on you.

571
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:19,555
No, it's all right. I was just
expecting someone. He's late.

572
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,974
Some people are late people.

573
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,226
- Almost an hour?
- That's pretty late.

574
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,811
Hmm. On my birthday?

575
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,356
- Oh, he's in the doghouse.
- Yes, he is.

576
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,485
John's an artist. He gets
caught up in his work.

577
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,862
Is he any good?

578
00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,367
He's brilliant, actually.

579
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,828
Maybe he's painting a portrait
of you for your birthday.

580
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,748
There are enough of those portraits
around the house, believe me.

581
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,374
Ah. Wow.

582
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:49,240
As intriguing as that is, we just met,

583
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,080
I should probably leave it alone.

584
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:55,299
I love him, he just does this too often.

585
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,880
So set him straight.

586
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,304
Tell him if he respects you,
he won't keep you waiting,

587
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,699
and that he's goddamn lucky

588
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,559
to have a woman as beautiful
and charming as you in his life.

589
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,436
What?

590
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,419
I'm can't tell if
you're flirting with me

591
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,520
or telling me to give
him another chance.

592
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:17,112
Well, if I was him, I know
I'd want another chance.

593
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,327
But I'm not him.

594
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,956
Happy birthday.

595
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,800
_

596
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:56,020
_

597
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,460
_

598
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:27,783
Hey!

599
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,330
Who the fuck is this guy?

600
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,209
Sorry, I just wanna make sure
you're on the right bus.

601
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,212
This one's headed to kind
of a rough part of town.

602
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,922
I know.

603
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,529
I didn't like the way my
patients were being treated

604
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,619
at the old hospital I worked at, so,

605
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,097
I'm starting at a new one on Main.

606
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,518
Oh. I take some of my clients
there. I'm a social worker.

607
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,644
- Oh.
- Yeah.

608
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:37,271
- Are you doctor or a... ?
- Uh, nurse.

609
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,397
- Nurse?
- Nurse, yeah.

610
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:39,855
Right.

611
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,194
Oh, it's a... it's a
pretty busy hospital.

612
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,573
Just to warn you. A lot of tough cases.

613
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:52,619
- Well, I'm pretty tough.
- I bet.

614
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,562
I just wanna help the people
who really need it, you know?

615
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,546
Yeah. Yeah, same.

616
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,511
My name's David.
