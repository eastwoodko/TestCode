1
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,288
Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate!

2
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,987
Emergency responders
are on high alert in London tonight

3
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:37,931
as the city deals with the aftermath
of a devastating explosion.

4
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,688
Eyewitness video shows a mushroom cloud

5
00:01:40,713 --> 00:01:43,538
rising from an apparent nuclear blast

6
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,123
that has created a firestorm

7
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,150
that continues to burn
in the heart of London.

8
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,628
That's exactly what I saw.

9
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,738
- Except you saw it happen here.
- Except it didn't.

10
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,551
Reports are flooding in
and we have just received word

11
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:00,221
that another explosion has happened,
this time in Shanghai, China.

12
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,391
It definitely looks like
the same type of explosion.

13
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,227
There's the mushroom cloud.
We still don't have any details.

14
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,604
- Oh, God.
- We haven't received word yet

15
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,356
on exactly when this happened,
but I believe it was just...

16
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,673
- Another one.
- Where?

17
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,110
Another nuke went off in Shanghai.

18
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,054
...somebody who saw the explosion happen.

19
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,293
Hi, this is David Mailer.

20
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,860
Please leave a message.

21
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,132
Hey, it's me. Uh, it's just after 6:00,
and you're not home,

22
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,786
and I think I'm going to start cooking
dinner, so fair warning.

23
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,164
Uh, okay. Call me. Bye.

24
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,851
Shit.

25
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,503
Hello?

26
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,922
Hello?

27
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,757
So how do we have this video?

28
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,051
A traveler team in Shanghai
tried to stop the second one.

29
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,137
They were live-streaming the mission
with their historian.

30
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,223
The devices went off
exactly an hour apart, on the hour.

31
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,498
They managed to send this.

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,648
- That looks like the Rothski device.
- Twenty-two years before its time.

33
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,591
- So this is definitely the Faction.
- There's one other thing.

34
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,610
Philip saw a bomb go off here, too.

35
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,320
Here in this city? How?

36
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,947
It must have been a projection
from another timeline.

37
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,032
At the exact same time
as the one in London.

38
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,451
So, what does that tell us?

39
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,203
Philip saw a timeline where the bombs
went off in a different order.

40
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,480
And the next one goes off on the hour.

41
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,400
The Faction stole enough enriched uranium
to make four or five of these things.

42
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,254
- One of them must be here.
- Where are you going?

43
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,572
To work. We need to warn people.

44
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,457
Marcy, you there?
We need you back at Ops.

45
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,603
Marcy?

46
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,879
Yeah, yeah.
I'm here. I'll be there soon as I can.

47
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,301
David?

48
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,013
David?

49
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,814
Hello? I'm in here! I'm inside!

50
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,278
David? Can you hear me?

51
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,924
Marcy?

52
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,616
Yes, yeah. I'm... I'm here. I'm here.

53
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,163
Oh, my God, I can hear
you inside my head.

54
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,142
That means I'm dying, doesn't it?

55
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,670
No, no, no. That is not what it means.
Are you hurt?

56
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,008
Uh...

57
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,761
I wanna say yes, but it doesn't hurt
as much as you think it would.

58
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,265
I got shot a whole bunch of times.

59
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:35,162
It's hard to see, there's so much blood,
but I don't think it's all mine.

60
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,289
What do you mean?

61
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,648
I was carrying bags of it.

62
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,670
This is an archive.

63
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,114
Archive, yes. Yeah, that's what the, um,

64
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,992
the dead woman
who's in here with me called it.

65
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,412
Before she got shot in the head.

66
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,959
Hey, Marce, you wanna open
the door so we can go home?

67
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:03,149
Because it's freezing cold in here
and I'm pretty sure this is a bad dream

68
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,800
and if I... if I can just get back
into my bed...

69
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,345
You're not dead, and you're not dreaming.

70
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,722
Yeah, I want to believe you but, uh...

71
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:18,939
But there's like... There's like,
uh, bullet holes in my shirt,

72
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,025
which I'm wearing.

73
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,490
So the only alternative
that I can think of is that, uh...

74
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,660
That I'm a zombie.

75
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,181
You're alive because
the blood bags you were holding onto

76
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,308
are full of something called nanites.

77
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,584
They're repairing the bullet damage.
Okay?

78
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,981
And you can hear me because

79
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,615
I implanted a communication
device on your body.

80
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,969
Implanted?

81
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,555
I, uh... I embedded a comm
just below your ear.

82
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,559
What? When? Why?

83
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,020
In case something like this happened.

84
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,732
You've been listening to what I'm doing?

85
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,609
Yes.

86
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,340
Can you hear what I'm thinking?

87
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,841
No. David, stop talking.

88
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,802
What exactly have you heard me doing?

89
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,762
Okay.
I need you to let go of that right now.

90
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,389
'Cause we need to get you out of here.

91
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,141
Okay, okay, well, I mean,
I was gonna try the vault door,

92
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,728
but there's... there's lasers crossing
in front of it on this side.

93
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,355
Do not cross the beams!

94
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,191
Y-Yeah, I know enough
not to cross the beams.

95
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:32,178
Okay, just... just stay put
and stay calm. I'm calling in my team.

96
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,740
You're not gonna be able
to hear me right now, okay?

97
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,784
But just be patient.

98
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,203
Okay, but hold on, before you hang up,

99
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,022
there's something
that you should probably know.

100
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,027
There's a big metal box in here that...

101
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,988
was not here before.

102
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,253
What...

103
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,842
Hey! What the fuck?!

104
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,703
If the Faction's targeting archives,

105
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,104
then why haven't we received this mission
from the Director?

106
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,983
Maybe you're driving too fast
for a messenger to stop us.

107
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,780
Philip,
how are those traffic lights coming?

108
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,823
You're good to go,
all the way to First Ave.

109
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,095
Which I could have done from the van
driving with you.

110
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,279
Somebody has to stay

111
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:40,687
outside the potential blast radius.

112
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,434
Other traveler teams have to learn
from what's gonna happen there today

113
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,293
if we can't disarm the device in time.

114
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,151
MacLaren, I thought you were coming in.

115
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,129
- We found the bomb.
- Where?

116
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,423
In the old fair grounds.
Focus your evacuation there.

117
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,092
I can do that. Where are you now?

118
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,676
I've already turned around
and heading there now.

119
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,804
- My team's en route.
- What's the address?

120
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,248
- You should evacuate...
- MacLaren, which building?

121
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,209
The old roller rink on Wallace.
I'll meet you there.

122
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,467
What's he doing in there?
Is he all right?

123
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,489
That answer is complicated.

124
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,658
- David!
- He can't hear you through the door.

125
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,326
That won't work either.
There's no service inside.

126
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,161
Then how are you communicating with him?

127
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,312
I, uh, I embedded a comm.

128
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,875
It was right after the kidnapping,
I was afraid for his safety...

129
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,043
Wow. Marcy.

130
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,462
- He wasn't even aware of it until now.
- It doesn't make it better.

131
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,714
All right, it's done.
Let's at least take advantage of it.

132
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,657
I assume that you can patch him through
to the whole team?

133
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,385
Yeah.

134
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,870
- Hey, Philip, you getting this?
- Five by five.

135
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,764
Hey, David, it's me again.

136
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,624
Hey, Marce, I was just
running through some recent

137
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,115
private activities in my head.

138
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:10,168
Okay, listen.

139
00:11:10,193 --> 00:11:11,730
The whole team's here, and they
want to talk to you directly.

140
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,756
So you're gonna have to patch them in
from your end.

141
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,401
Okay, how do I do that?

142
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,385
I need you to press right
below your left ear,

143
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,619
right beside your jawline.

144
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:21,565
What? This lump?

145
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,160
Jesus, Marcy, I thought that was a tumor.
You told me it was a cyst!

146
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,169
It's called a comm,

147
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,795
and special FBI teams use it to
communicate with each other.

148
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,041
I need you to press on it
three times gently

149
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,317
and then hold it until it beeps.

150
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:36,463
Okay.

151
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,067
- David?
- Agent MacLaren?

152
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,134
Right, we gotta move here.

153
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,970
So listen carefully
and do exactly what we tell you to do.

154
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,305
The next voice you'll hear
will be Trevor's.

155
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,056
He's gonna run you
through the next steps.

156
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,393
Hey, David. I want you to describe to me
the box you told Marcy about.

157
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,004
Uh, okay, it's, uh,
it's right in the middle of the room.

158
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,882
It's a big steel box with, like, a...

159
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,967
It's like a...

160
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,129
Like... I'm trying to describe the top.

161
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,656
It's like... I wanna say hatch.

162
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,516
The whole box is one foot by two feet
by three feet tall?

163
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,808
Yeah, almost exactly.

164
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,455
It's the same dimensions
as the Rothski device.

165
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,440
- I should be able to talk him through it.
- The what device?

166
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,360
You haven't told him yet?

167
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,947
The metal box is a casing
for a nuclear bomb.

168
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,301
We can't get into the archive
without setting it off,

169
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,035
so you need to disarm it from inside.

170
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,723
I... I need to what?

171
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,142
We need you to defuse the bomb, David.

172
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,627
- I know that's a lot to ask.
- A lot to ask?

173
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,297
All I wanted to do
was to get in better shape,

174
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,567
learn how to use a gun and flip people!

175
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,820
- This is way, way, way...
- David. David.

176
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,949
You told Agent Callahan at the farm
you wanted to man up.

177
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,100
We are running out of time,
and you're our only option.

178
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,079
So, now would be the moment
to man the fuck up.

179
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,455
The terrorists only left you inside there

180
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,357
'cause they thought you were dead.
This is a stroke of luck, David.

181
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,960
Luck?

182
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,945
You can save a lot of people,
but we are running out of time.

183
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,822
Okay.

184
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,468
If that's true,
then you need to run, Marcy.

185
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,954
Please, please,
just get far away from here.

186
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,250
Nobody's leaving you here.
I'm not leaving you here.

187
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,627
Hey, David, Philip here.

188
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,439
Just, uh, you know, FYI,

189
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,134
they don't have enough time
to get way even if they left now, so...

190
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,936
Okay, go.

191
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,875
If we're right about the design,

192
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,527
the top of the device hinges open,
one side is screwed shut.

193
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,072
Yeah, there's... there's two screws
on one side.

194
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,117
Okay, so what in that room
might possibly work as a screwdriver?

195
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,479
There's nothing like that.

196
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,689
Search the whole room.

197
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,757
A piece of metal.
Maybe one of the shelves.

198
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,028
I would need a screwdriver
to take apart the shelves.

199
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,052
I'm telling you...

200
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,306
there's nothing like that.

201
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,682
Check the archivist's body.

202
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,271
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,466
- I've got a knife!
- My man! Get to work on that first screw.

204
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,967
Don't put pressure
anywhere else on the case.

205
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,302
Let me know when you're done.

206
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,326
Okay.

207
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,871
It's working.

208
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,875
Guys, you've got company.

209
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,066
We got someone on the inside.
We're walking him through the procedure.

210
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,175
- One of your team?
- Her boyfriend.

211
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,028
Okay, that's it. Both screws are out.

212
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,572
You're on fire, brother,
it should lift off freely now.

213
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,515
Go ahead and do that.
Then tell me what you see.

214
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,398
Uh, it's like a...

215
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,261
it's like a big metal plate.

216
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:01,377
That's the shielding plate.

217
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,653
It's friction fit.
It should lift right off in your hands.

218
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,884
Okay, what do I do with it?

219
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,427
Put it down on the ground gently

220
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,870
and then tell me what you see inside
starting from right to left.

221
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,725
Getting real tight on time, guys.

222
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,811
Uh, there's like, uh...
a brick-shaped box

223
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,838
with a bunch of, um, like,
electronicky things coming out of it

224
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,402
to... a cylinder that's on either side

225
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,737
of what looks like,
uh, like a big shot put.

226
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,513
Don't touch it,
that's the nuclear material.

227
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,700
- Okay. That's good to know.
- Now here comes the fun part.

228
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,310
You see those thick cables coming out
of the electronicky thing?

229
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,247
- Yeah.
- Those feed the detonator,

230
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,748
but they've been rigged
with a tamper switch.

231
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,566
You have to short it with some wire.

232
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,711
Coming up on 60 seconds.

233
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,754
Jesus Christ.

234
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,797
- Trevor.
- Yeah, yeah.

235
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,133
There should be a ground wire
tucked behind those cables.

236
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,908
It might be green or yellow-green.

237
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,328
Forty-five seconds.

238
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,015
- All the wires are black!
- That's okay. That's not a problem.

239
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,083
It'll be the thinnest one,
connected directly...

240
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,297
Thirty seconds.

241
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,298
...to the casing.

242
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,384
You have to cut it free.

243
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,927
Sorry, I've got blood in my eyes.

244
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,181
David, it's the thinnest wire
connected directly to the casing.

245
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,099
Right. Okay.

246
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,579
- Fifteen.
- Okay, I think I found it.

247
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,896
Perfect. Now cut that wire.

248
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,469
- You guys hear that?
- David, grab the core with both hands,

249
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,055
pull it out as hard as you can
and throw it on the floor, now!

250
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,185
Did I do it?

251
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,480
Yeah. You did it.

252
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,526
The bomb is disarmed.

253
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,156
Okay, okay, so that's it?

254
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,535
Can I come out now?

255
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,412
Yes, sir, mission accomplished.

256
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,807
Now that the bomb is deactivated,

257
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,166
the laser should be disabled.

258
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,520
There's a biometric lock
on this side of the door,

259
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,920
there should be one on that side, too.

260
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,756
Yeah, I see it. I think
I know what to do.

261
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,479
Oh, my God.

262
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,441
It looks worse than it is.

263
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,656
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no. No.

264
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,035
David. You did great.
Better than anyone could have asked.

265
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,768
It's just a little burn.
It was really heating up in there.

266
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,478
Right, okay. Let's get you looked at.

267
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,689
- I'm taking him back to Ops.
- Maybe a proper hospital...

268
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,941
I need him where I know for certain
the Director can see him

269
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,008
and can send a D team.

270
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,969
- That's what it's gonna take.
- Okay.

271
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,448
Trev, go with them, I'll stay
with the archives until relief gets here.

272
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,349
Just in case the Faction tries something.

273
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,103
Wait, wait. What am I missing?

274
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,957
When David grabbed a hold
of the nuclear core,

275
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,150
his body was exposed to lethal radiation.

276
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,069
His internal organs
will begin to liquefy in a few hours.

277
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,368
But you have advanced technology.

278
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,121
I guess it's possible
the Director will send help.

279
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,225
But right now,
I need you to tell the S.A.C.

280
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,060
the Faction is targeting archives,

281
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,712
and there's another one just like this
in Russia.

282
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,297
Not anymore, boss.

283
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,134
Another device just detonated in Moscow.

284
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,262
Ours is the only archive left.

285
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,850
This latest event marks the third
nuclear attack in as many hours,

286
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,978
and officials still do not know
who's behind the atta...

287
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,162
Mission?

288
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,249
I don't know who the fuck
do you think that I am,

289
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,669
but I'm not playing your TV game.

290
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,079
Ugh. Fuck.

291
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,815
You just hit
a metro police officer, asshole.

292
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,957
This is vital to the future?

293
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,560
Since they arrived,

294
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,730
the Faction have been destroying elements
of the historical record

295
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,339
in order to blind the Director.

296
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,675
This is our countermeasure.

297
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,427
Blood?

298
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,864
Nanites placed in the blood

299
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,267
write and store information
into dormant genes of DNA.

300
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,146
You can archive a hell of lot of data
into a small amount of blood.

301
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,440
How much?

302
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,378
Pretty much all the digital information
in the 21st century.

303
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,422
Well, all that's useful to us.

304
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,490
Traffic cameras, cell phone videos,
phone calls.

305
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,492
How do you get it to the future?

306
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,681
The genetically rewritten blood
is transfused

307
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,916
into known ancestors
of people who survive until our time.

308
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,854
Why are you suddenly answering
all of my questions?

309
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,757
Because right now, I really need you
to believe we're on the same side.

310
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:12,480
3468? I'm 6117.
We're here to secure the site.

311
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,064
The core's at the back.

312
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,251
You think you can save the archive?

313
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,545
Depends on how badly
the blood was irradiated.

314
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,155
Archival nanites are pretty susceptible
to hard radiation.

315
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,259
I was afraid you'd say that.

316
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,410
They'll have to be replaced
with military-grade.

317
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,454
I'll leave you to it.

318
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,086
Where are you going?

319
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,981
Change my clothes
before I head back to Ops.

320
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,592
You mean the office.
We need to report what happened here.

321
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,427
How about you take the first draft?

322
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,719
- So this is your bat cave?
- Safe house. No bats.

323
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,015
So that's where the elevator is, I guess,
take you down to the other levels.

324
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,660
No, that's the bathroom.
This is the whole place.

325
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,269
All right. Get up on here.

326
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:17,938
Ow! Mother...

327
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,235
I think my hands
are burned worse than I thought.

328
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,030
They're very bad
and it's gonna get worse.

329
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,409
This should help with the pain.

330
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:36,873
No kidding.

331
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,001
What is that?

332
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,377
It's classified.

333
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,631
Too bad. Have you guys tried that?

334
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,342
You all look worried.

335
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,218
We are.

336
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,198
Well, maybe MacLaren's right.
Maybe I should go to a real hospital.

337
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,350
No, this is where you need to be.

338
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,186
All right, let's get that shirt off you.

339
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,273
Uh, usually, I love it
when she says that.

340
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,319
- I also love this shirt.
- Hey, it's okay, just let her do her job.

341
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,490
Are you an FBI doctor, too?

342
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,259
Tactician.

343
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,203
Oh. I... I don't know what that is.

344
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,726
Where are they?

345
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,985
Hopefully, they're manufacturing
whatever they need

346
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,079
and will be here soon.

347
00:24:23,103 --> 00:24:25,172
They should have already been here by now
and you know it.

348
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,715
Marce, it's all right.

349
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,569
I mean, no matter what happens now,

350
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,012
didn't we just stop a nuclear bomb
from going off?

351
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:38,227
I mean, shouldn't there be a cake
and a "Yay, team"?

352
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,022
Maybe after we get you cleaned up
and you've rested a while.

353
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,025
All right. Let's get this shirt off.

354
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,126
Oh, my God.

355
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,754
- It's not my blood.
- Then whose...?

356
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,005
You know what? Never mind.

357
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,761
Happy as I am to see you, I've got
to change and get back out there.

358
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,699
They just canceled the evacuation alert.

359
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,766
I know, I was part of the team
that found the bomb.

360
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,603
Of course you were.

361
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:31,739
Okay. Get what you need,
get changed and go.

362
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,866
I want you out.

363
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,202
- What?
- Don't pretend you didn't hear me.

364
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,558
Why are you making a big deal
that I forgot something?

365
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,143
This isn't just something.

366
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,020
- Can we talk about this when I get home?
- No. This is my home!

367
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,005
You don't get to stay here, I do.

368
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,192
I couldn't believe your things
were still here when I walked in.

369
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,944
Did I not tell you about my fucking day?

370
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,471
Get back to it, then,
don't let me stop you!

371
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,496
Please, tell me you're not throwing away
a decade of marriage

372
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,081
and all the time before that

373
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,275
just because I couldn't remember
something that happened 17 years ago.

374
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,652
You know what I really threw away?

375
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,864
A chance to have a life with John.

376
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:18,118
- Why do you keep mentioning...?
- Instead, I chose you.

377
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,789
The man who came into my life
and swept me off my feet.

378
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,976
- The man you used to be.
- I am right here.

379
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,686
No, Grant. That's the problem.

380
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,795
That man is gone.

381
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,882
The new one scares me.

382
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,594
I packed your bags.

383
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,014
You only ever wear a third
of your wardrobe anyway, it's all there.

384
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,510
So, I was thinking...

385
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,182
I got shot several times
in something called an archive,

386
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,995
but I didn't die
because of something called nanites

387
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:30,524
that were in the blood I was holding
that repaired the bullet wounds,

388
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,571
and you installed a comm in my neck
that... that let us talk.

389
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,990
Mm-hmm.

390
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,909
And you still wanna
stick with FBI doctor?

391
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,830
Are you gonna tell me
what's really going on?

392
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,085
I know I can be sometimes...

393
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,089
willfully naive, but, uh...

394
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,051
I'm not completely dumb.

395
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,516
Uh, how's the pain?

396
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,396
It's worse, actually.

397
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,319
I could use a top up of that magic drug.

398
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,662
Just get some more sleep, okay?

399
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,250
- We'll talk about it in the morning.
- Okay, but don't forget, okay?

400
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:36,423
Because I'd really like to hear
the answers... to those questions.

401
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,676
She's here.

402
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,141
Hey.

403
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,621
Still losing nanites?

404
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,688
We're down to 20 percent
of what we started with.

405
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,209
Bloodwork?

406
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,027
CBC every two hours.
Lymphocytes aren't looking good.

407
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,361
Okay.

408
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,341
Levofloxacin and iodine. Transfusions?

409
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,908
Stem cells and platelets so far.

410
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,802
I brought what nanites I had,

411
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,995
but what he's gonna need
is military-grade.

412
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,123
Thank you.

413
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,393
I just have to believe
for what David did,

414
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,878
the Director has a D team
manufacturing them right now.

415
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,132
Okay. Shift change.

416
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,028
You need to get some rest
or you're not gonna be any good to him.

417
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,052
I got this.

418
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,573
- Ilsa, what's happening?
- I'm receiving a transmission.

419
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,511
From the Director?

420
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,329
Presumably, but my functions
have not been suspended.

421
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,266
It appears to be an upload,

422
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,519
writing a large block of encrypted data
into my racetrack core.

423
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,669
What?

424
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,586
Can you block it?

425
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,732
- No.
- Well...

426
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,717
Is it overwriting anything essential?
Are you okay?

427
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,011
If it continues,

428
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:06,037
my cognitive ability will
become significantly reduced.

429
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,106
Hi. Yeah, yeah, I know it's late.

430
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,584
Yes, very late, okay. I'm sorry.

431
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,902
Just shut up for a second.

432
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,697
Something strange is happening with Ilsa.

433
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,784
No, I don't want to talk about it
on the phone, just get over here.

434
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,141
Hey.

435
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,204
- Did she stay up with him all night?
- Yeah.

436
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,023
I made her take a couple of hours
when I first got here, but that's it.

437
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,441
How's he doing?

438
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,521
The small amount of
nanites that I brought

439
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:02,670
kept him going through the night.

440
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,321
But they're already
starting to fail, too.

441
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,199
Okay.

442
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,463
Shit. Mac!

443
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,777
- Listen to this.
- Carly, it's Jeff,

444
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,153
I got kidnapped.

445
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,543
I got outta the room they had me in,

446
00:31:28,568 --> 00:31:30,454
but they've got people at every exit.

447
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,742
I think it's like an abandoned mall
or something.

448
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,244
I know this breaks Protocol 6,
but I need you to...

449
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,832
- How old is that message?
- At least eight hours.

450
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,793
Philip, pull up all the malls
in the area.

451
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,988
Can you identify which ones
are abandoned or under construction?

452
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,302
That's the only one it could be.

453
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,763
I need you to monitor the traffic cams
in and out of there.

454
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,871
Yes, sir.

455
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,167
Trev.

456
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,671
Looks like it's just you and me again.

457
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,381
We'll comm in.

458
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,806
Hey.

459
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,641
Oh, it's you again.

460
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,603
Tell me how you're feeling.

461
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,233
Worse.

462
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,777
I'd go for a top up of that...

463
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,655
I only have so much. I have to ration it.

464
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,034
I was hoping
that it wouldn't be necessary by now.

465
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,745
You're that good of a doctor?

466
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,374
No, I was just expecting help to arrive.

467
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,917
From the Director.

468
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,004
- What...?
- I heard you.

469
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,798
So, should I be jealous of this guy?

470
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,384
No.

471
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,512
David.

472
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,891
I don't really work for the FBI.

473
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,142
Yeah, no.

474
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:00,812
I know.

475
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,899
You're from the future.

476
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,818
The archivist told me.

477
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,073
I think she thought
I was one of you guys.

478
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,120
Sounds like you're trying
to save the world, huh?

479
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,083
Are you angry?

480
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,711
For trying to save the world?

481
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,421
No, for...

482
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,133
for deceiving you all this time.

483
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,677
I knew something was going on.

484
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,642
- Maybe for not trusting me.
- No.

485
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,353
I do trust you.

486
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,941
Not enough to tell me
that I'm not gonna make it.

487
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,253
And I know I'm not,
by the way I'm feeling...

488
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:53,365
David, David, David. I believe...
I believe that help is on the way.

489
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,492
I know that you do.

490
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,579
I love that about you.

491
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,499
You saved thousands of lives.

492
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,001
The Director has to save you for that.

493
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,922
I had the balls to do that
because you were there.

494
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:17,365
Instead of the good stuff,
maybe you can give me something else?

495
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,535
Because this pain...
This pain is getting real bad.

496
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,601
Okay, okay.

497
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,864
And then, maybe, can we go home?

498
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,201
The Director's gotta know
our address, right?

499
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,372
Okay.

500
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,207
Oh, this stuff is...

501
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,336
is making me sleepy.

502
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,425
I know. I know.

503
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:54,926
Please don't go, okay?

504
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,973
I wanna keep talking.
I'm just gonna close my eyes for a sec.

505
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,766
Stay.

506
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,332
Nothing on this level.

507
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,505
Carly, meet me at the loading dock,
I may have something.

508
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,356
Philip, we're too late. They're gone.

509
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,209
I'll go back in the feeds.
They had to be there at some point.

510
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,240
Hold up.

511
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,937
Carly.

512
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,524
We found him.

513
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,255
It just passed a petabyte.

514
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,841
Then it's overwriting her core
memory now. Can you stop it?

515
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,865
Not even if I wanted to.

516
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,495
Look, Ilsa may be artificial,
but life is life.

517
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,849
Are you trying to convince me
that you care now?

518
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,375
We both know your little secret.

519
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,145
Ilsa has only crossed
the sentience threshold

520
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,022
as a result of contact with the Director.

521
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,191
You kept it to yourself because you know
if the government found out,

522
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,943
they'd swoop in
and take Ilsa away from you.

523
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,804
Maybe that's true,
but it's still isn't right.

524
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,350
Well, don't worry.
The Director can't take a life.

525
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:12,581
Ilsa's capacity may be reduced,
but her core "consciousness,"

526
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,500
if you can call it that,
will be left intact.

527
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,544
The Director's just getting rid
of old coding,

528
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,570
you know, uh, redundancies and...

529
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,864
useless things.

530
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,284
Well, that makes me feel a little better.

531
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,806
And I'll feel better when I find out

532
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,791
if this massive program it's downloading
is the one I think it is.

533
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,051
You've got another patient.

534
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,096
Hey, let me take a look.

535
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,480
Easy.

536
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,066
I got him, I got him.

537
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,462
Honestly, it's not that bad.

538
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,821
- Stop it. Let her help you.
- You don't look so good.

539
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,843
Maybe it's because I was captured,
questioned, and left for dead.

540
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,952
- By the Faction?
- By 001.

541
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,125
He was bricked in behind a false wall,
strapped to a wheelchair.

542
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,834
They're working together.

543
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,047
That was my mission. To find out.

544
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:21,925
Instead, they found me out.

545
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,012
If it wasn't for you...

546
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,815
How is he?

547
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,154
I need that D team to show up.

548
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,425
Right now. And I mean right now.

549
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,910
- Because he can't hold on any longer.
- Marcy, I...

550
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,205
Did you hear me?

551
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,333
I know that you know who I am.

552
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,752
I know that you're watching.

553
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,756
You saved my life
when you reset my consciousness.

554
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,969
You saved him after a plane crash
that he never should have survived.

555
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,639
So why won't you save the life of a man

556
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,869
who, without any training,
without having sworn any oath,

557
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,272
and without any regard for his own life,
saved thousands of people?

558
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,774
Why?

559
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,944
Marce?

560
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,006
Hey, hey. I'm sorry.

561
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,383
I'm here. I'm here.

562
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,407
No kidding.

563
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,661
I'm sure they heard you shouting
a mile away.

564
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:33,788
She had good reason.

565
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,624
Agent MacLaren.

566
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,879
Oh, I ruined your suit, didn't I?

567
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,508
- It looked like a really expensive one.
- That's okay.

568
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,761
David, I want you to know
how grateful we all are.

569
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,515
Not a lot of people can say
they saved 50,000 lives.

570
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,726
I'm gonna put that on my résumé.

571
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,937
So, I'm laying here wondering...

572
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,690
what's your real name?

573
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,902
In the future, I mean.

574
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,070
The future?

575
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,659
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

576
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,080
3468.

577
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,894
That's a dumb name.

578
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,045
Yeah, it is.

579
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,423
It's one of the things in the future
we're hoping to change.

580
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,675
What about you?

581
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,929
No, don't... don't tell me.

582
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,389
Marcy...

583
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,018
can we go home now?

584
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,355
I feel like I'd be more
comfortable there.

585
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,818
Okay. Let's go home.

586
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,738
But can everyone else come?

587
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,325
Because I got a lot of other questions.

588
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,701
Everyone's here.

589
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,665
So why did you come all this way?

590
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,167
I mean, to this century.

591
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,063
Things aren't going so well
in the future, David.

592
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,588
And we wanted to change that.

593
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,132
Yeah, no, I mean...

594
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,005
Then why didn't you just

595
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,865
tell us what was gonna go
wrong and how to fix it?

596
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,867
You already knew what was going wrong.

597
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,143
And what you needed to do to fix it.

598
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,645
Yeah, maybe...

599
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,961
We believed if we just stopped
enough bad things from happening,

600
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,820
the future we came from
would never happen.

601
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,257
Right, but why all the secrets?

602
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,534
I mean, why not just say,

603
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,122
"Hey, we're from the future.
Things are about to go ratshit.

604
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,708
- Let's fix this."
- Who would believe us?

605
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,770
Yeah, it does sound a little bullshitty
when you say it out loud.

606
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,045
It really does.

607
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,758
But you could prove it was true
pretty easy, couldn't you?

608
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,678
I mean, you must have knowledge
way beyond what we know.

609
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,991
And every world power
would do all that they could

610
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,475
to extract that knowledge
for its own gain.

611
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,104
The 21st century screwed
things up, David.

612
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,380
We're just trying to clean up the mess.

613
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,567
But it's our mess.

614
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,193
Don't you get it?

615
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,281
We should be the ones to fix it.

616
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,619
What if after all that you've done,
it still doesn't work?

617
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,120
We haven't given up.

618
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,166
So long as the Director exists,
I doubt we ever will.

619
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,961
Wow.

620
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,132
I could talk all night about this stuff.

621
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,054
We should have, like,
a big dinner here some time.

622
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,768
But I'm getting tired all of a sudden.

623
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,270
Okay. We'll go.

624
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,065
Thank you, David.

625
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,038
Ah, get over here, you hero, you.

626
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,665
Honestly. Good job, brother.

627
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,547
Bravest thing I've ever seen. Really.

628
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,928
Get some rest. You deserve it.

629
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,303
Don't be strangers.

630
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,264
Strangers?

631
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,143
David, you're part of the team now.

632
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,245
Don't you wish
you could just stay here like this?

633
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,789
Maybe we can.

634
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,542
Let's try.

635
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,641
Boyd?

636
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,643
Boyd?

637
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,789
BP's bottoming out.

638
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:11,357
- He's fibrillating.
- Hey. Hey, David, hold on.

639
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,920
David, please hold on. David! David!

640
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:16,237
Please hold on.

641
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:21,617
Hey.

642
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,375
I love you so much.

643
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:35,047
I love you.

644
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,845
Protocol Omega.

645
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,145
No. No.

646
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,106
No.

647
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:22,430
