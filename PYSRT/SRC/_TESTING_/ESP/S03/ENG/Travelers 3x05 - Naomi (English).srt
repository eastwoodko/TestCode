1
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,875
Slow down, man.
This is very early for me.

2
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,919
Just push through it, Philip.
I'll tell you when you're tired.

3
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,196
Is that it? We're done?

4
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,825
Nah. It's Gary letting me know
they're on the road.

5
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,911
His mother passed.

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,120
You probably already knew that.

7
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,209
Contrary to popular belief,
I don't have a memory of everything.

8
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:47,130
Just certain things deemed important
by the programmers or the Director.

9
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,150
Grandma Gary's death wasn't one of 'em?

10
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,343
Not everybody has a part to play
in the grand plan.

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,198
Well, she wasn't the type to take
something like that personally, so...

12
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,723
I did know
about your grandfather's death.

13
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,577
He was a host candidate.
Never chosen, but...

14
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,247
See, now you're
just trying to distract me

15
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,083
- so you can get out of exercise.
- And you're just trying to torture me.

16
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,876
Philip, once you've
lived in a body so old

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,420
that the slightest fall
would shatter your bones,

18
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,132
and I sincerely hope you live so long,
then you'll know this isn't torture.

19
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,576
So on your feet, roomie.

20
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,119
Come on.

21
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,165
Come on.

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,937
Nuclear energy is considered
a form of clean air energy

23
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,898
because it doesn't produce
greenhouse gas.

24
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,775
But there are some people who think

25
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,029
that label ignores one important
by-product of the process.

26
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,305
Does anybody know what that is?

27
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:41,768
It's something you have left
when the radioactive fuel is spent.

28
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,454
We forgot.

29
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,791
Okay, we talked about this in class.
You know this.

30
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,087
This is an emergency evacuation alert.

31
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,571
This is not a drill.

32
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,508
All personnel, evacuate immediately.

33
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,801
This is not a drill.

34
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,554
Okay, everyone follow me back
to the bus right now. Walk. Don't run.

35
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:02,015
This is an emergency evacuation alert.

36
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,457
This is not a drill.

37
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,809
All personnel...

38
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,769
We were called in to assist.
We have clearance.

39
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,938
I don't care what your pass says.
Exit the building now.

40
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,064
There isn't much time.

41
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,483
You don't understand.
We need to get in there.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,987
I'm locked out of the backups, too.

43
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,263
Containment doors
in sector 77 are secure.

44
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,825
Loading bay doors are not responding.

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,980
I can't even perform
a system-wide reboot.

46
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,169
What are your
conversion numbers coming in at?

47
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,194
They're trying to break in again.

48
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,796
Come on, come on, come on.

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,741
...a drill.
All personnel, evacuate immediately.

50
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,368
Shit. I'm locked out.

51
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,203
Who are these guys?

52
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,889
Nothing's working.

53
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,267
Warning. Levels critical.

54
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,936
Pressure in the primary coolant loop
just went up another 22 percent.

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,189
- The porvs are gonna vent automatically.
- Shut them down.

56
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,316
The system isn't designed
to handle that much. It'll blow.

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,442
Levels critical.

58
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,929
Warning. Levels critical.

59
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,807
Warning. Levels critical.

60
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:05,977
Wait.

61
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,082
- Pressure's dropping.
- How did you do it?

62
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,109
I don't know. I don't care.

63
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,201
Hey. What are you doing in here?

64
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,725
We need some help in here.

65
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,976
Hey. Hey!

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,961
Somebody call an ambulance! We need help!

67
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,861
Good morning.

68
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,156
You seem surprised to see me.

69
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,009
No. Why would I be?

70
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,035
Well, 'cause I'm usually gone
by now, but...

71
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,057
I just wanted to say how happy I was
to see you home last night.

72
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,061
Even if it was just for a split second
before you ran off into the bedroom.

73
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,691
- I did not run off. I was tired.
- Uh-huh?

74
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,609
So tired, you pretended to be asleep

75
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,303
when I got into bed a minute later,
and when I woke up?

76
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,388
I was not pretending.

77
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,766
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

78
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,644
'Cause for a moment there,
I was afraid you were trying to avoid me.

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,000
I did wait up for you.
But it got late and I was getting tired,

80
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,544
and I knew if I stayed,
we'd end up talking for hours, so...

81
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,006
What would be so wrong with that?
That's one of the things we do best.

82
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,949
Well, it's in the top two.

83
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,410
Okay, you know what?
Do we have to talk about this right now?

84
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,914
So when's a good time?
What, do I have to book an appointment?

85
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,102
We already have one.
Tomorrow at 3:00, remember?

86
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,897
- I texted you.
- Oh, God. Right.

87
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,381
We're paying someone
to have a conversation.

88
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,322
Okay, I have to go back to my mom,
so I'm gonna go and get ready.

89
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,346
Kat.

90
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,228
Tomorrow at 3:00... I'll be there.

91
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,674
- Well, you don't have a fever.
- I could've told you that.

92
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,699
I'm fine.

93
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,804
Honey, you were taken
to a hospital yesterday

94
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,430
and can't remember
what you were doing, so...

95
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,099
A-F-0-0-1-3-

96
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,061
B-E-6-9-4-8-

97
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,188
1-C-3-2-D...

98
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,399
- Naomi? I don't understand.
- ...1-3-0-5-7...

99
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,344
- 1-4-1-0-5...
- Honey, what are you saying?

100
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,097
- Naomi.
- ...2-8-8-4...

101
00:05:47,235 --> 00:05:48,282
Honey?

102
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,724
B-C...

103
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,482
- What?
- Good morning.

104
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,316
What are you doing here?

105
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,922
- I brought breakfast.
- Why?

106
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,883
Because it's the most far out thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

107
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,202
Three completely different foods
on a muffin from England.

108
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,973
Welcome to the 21st.

109
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,266
Thank you.

110
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,125
So... I was practicing driving,

111
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:20,022
and I followed another car
into this restaurant drive-through,

112
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,774
and I asked the lady
at the window, I said,

113
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,651
"Just give me
what the guy ahead of me ordered."

114
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,386
And she asked
if I wanted to make it a meal.

115
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,848
And I said,
"Hey, ma'am, that's what I'm here for."

116
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,620
Hey, don't let it get cold.

117
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,479
- That's some good stuff right there.
- What do you want?

118
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,897
Your help.

119
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,441
Ask your team.

120
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,693
I don't have a team.

121
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:43,129
Why not?

122
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,322
I probably shouldn't answer that
on account of Protocol 6.

123
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,258
Okay. What about your training?

124
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,659
Part of my training was to come
talk to you. Learn all about Jeff.

125
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,540
All right, what do you wanna know?

126
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,753
Look... I get that my host
wasn't the finest human being.

127
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,047
- He was an asshole.
- I bet he was.

128
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,175
Because I know how far you
went to make damn sure

129
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,450
that he was a host candidate.

130
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,639
And that you came this close
to killing him with your bare hands.

131
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,642
But I'm not him.

132
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,311
Good.

133
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,564
But I do need to be able to fake it.

134
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,959
So any information
that you could give me...

135
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,239
- What is it?
- Probably just David Mailer.

136
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,677
Apparently, I wanted to meet up with him.

137
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,620
- Do you know what about?
- No.

138
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,831
- Should I?
- If you think it's your Protocol 5.

139
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,125
Well, no, he's not...
he's not really my type.

140
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,501
That's not what I meant.

141
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,480
I know.

142
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,649
Listen. I'm just trying to figure out
what I'm supposed to be.

143
00:07:50,844 --> 00:07:51,864
What?

144
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,890
Yeah, this isn't David.
You mind if we do this later?

145
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,266
Sure.

146
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,400
...there was an option.

147
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,945
Should have it to you
by the end of the day.

148
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,573
Thanks. I wish I didn't need it, but...

149
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,784
Whoa.

150
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,744
Message incoming on the deep.

151
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,959
"Programmer urgently required
to resolve corrupted messenger."

152
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,710
Has that happened before?

153
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,399
- Sounds like it just did.
- Okay.

154
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,384
I'll tell them we got one.
Make up an ID for Grace, please.

155
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:39,412
Grace Day, FBI Specialist
in socially inappropriate behavior.

156
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,360
For the record,
I take offence to your instructions.

157
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,654
- Which part?
- "Try not to speak."

158
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,508
You can submit your objection
in writing to the Director

159
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,950
in a few hundred years.

160
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,978
- Mrs. Gillen.
- Yes?

161
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,089
Special Agent Grant
MacLaren with the FBI.

162
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:07,314
These are my associates.

163
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,658
We're here to do a medical follow-up

164
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,484
on the incident involving your daughter

165
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,861
at the Seaton Generating Station.

166
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,237
Why would the FBI be involved?

167
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,740
It's a formality, really. We'll be out
of your hair in a few minutes.

168
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,117
- The doctor said that she was fine.
- I'm sure she is.

169
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,995
But because Seaton's a nuclear facility
under federal jurisdiction,

170
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,271
- you know how it is.
- It's a simple test.

171
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,398
- We'll be in and out.
- So where is she?

172
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,904
That is Grace.

173
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,572
Please, come in.

174
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,720
D-7-1-3-5-0...

175
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,288
- Oh, hey there.
- It started up again?

176
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,851
She's been doing this on and off
since the field trip.

177
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,895
I can't make out
what she's saying, but it's...

178
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,253
Wow, it's still running.

179
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,841
She means running a fever.

180
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,047
Yeah, but we just checked
a half hour ago.

181
00:09:54,072 --> 00:09:55,361
Her temperature's perfectly normal.

182
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,847
How about the string of hexidecimal code
she's mumbling through?

183
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,409
Doctor said that was, uh,
a post traumatic response

184
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,328
from the alarm going off
during the field trip.

185
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,814
- Well, your doctor sounds like an idiot.
- Let's just run the test, shall we?

186
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,775
D-6-2-7-C-5-0-0...

187
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,545
- What's her name again?
- Naomi.

188
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,530
- I know a Naomi.
- It's from the Bible.

189
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,425
This one's a skinny ninth grader
with a speech impediment.

190
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,135
Okay. Naomi...

191
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,514
I need you to look at this tablet
uninterrupted for at least 20 seconds.

192
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,265
That's all you need to do.

193
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,834
And then we can celebrate with cake
or something.

194
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,104
Yeah, how is looking at that
gonna help with anything?

195
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,231
There's an interrupted program
inside her brain

196
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,191
that hasn't completed its end script

197
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,093
and is causing junk processes
that are more or less shorting her out.

198
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,821
It's a metaphor.

199
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,223
- It won't hurt.
- Uninterrupted for 20 seconds.

200
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,414
Oh, somebody needs to hold her still.

201
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,376
- She doesn't wanna look at it.
- I assure you this is necessary.

202
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,568
Dan, it's fine.

203
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,718
Naomi?

204
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,970
Mom?

205
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,265
How did I get here?

206
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,601
You don't remember?

207
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,686
Some disorientation is normal.

208
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,582
- Sure. We'll go with that.
- Well, we're done here.

209
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,126
- Thank you so much, Mr. and Mrs. Gillen.
- Thank you.

210
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,420
And please call me
with any further questions or concerns.

211
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,444
Mm-hm.

212
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,740
Grace.

213
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,992
I gotta say,
this is a bit outside my element.

214
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,061
I've got a great selection
in the cabinet for beginners here.

215
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,414
It's kinda small, isn't it?

216
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,666
You know they say size doesn't matter.

217
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,294
Right, yeah.
What, they have to say that?

218
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,379
It's the stopping power of the caliber.

219
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,547
Right.

220
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,239
David, what are you doing?

221
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,868
Wow, that is...
That's way heavier than it looks.

222
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,914
Our Father who art in Heaven,

223
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,292
hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come,

224
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,979
Thy will be done on earth...

225
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,274
- ...as it is in Heaven.
- 6-F-0-0-1-1...

226
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,317
Naomi?

227
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,986
- ...3-6-7-8-9...
- Naomi.

228
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,929
- ...5-4-3...
- Naomi.

229
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:49,644
...as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and...

230
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,065
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

231
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,732
Nothing, honey.

232
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,495
Jeff.

233
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,748
Hey. Mitch. Glad you got our note.

234
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,812
So how'd you know?

235
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,271
That you belong in our group?

236
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,900
Well, you haven't exactly kept
your opinions to yourself at work, right?

237
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,468
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess not.
- Yeah.

238
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,472
The others will be here in a bit.
You wanna give me a hand setting up?

239
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,103
Thanks.

240
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,527
Okay, kiddo. Let's go see Dr. Lee.

241
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,494
Hon.

242
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,923
The most important thing
to remember is that we're not alone.

243
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,987
Travelers have impacted all of our lives.

244
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:09,074
But the truth is being covered up
by the media, by the government,

245
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,268
and especially by those people
in our lives who we know have changed,

246
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,372
no matter how hard they wanna try
and convince us otherwise.

247
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,816
So I think a good place for us to start
would be for us to share, um...

248
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,111
You all right?

249
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,239
Yeah, think so.

250
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,284
I just didn't expect it to be
so many people.

251
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,347
I've been at this a while alone,
you know.

252
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,349
I get it. We all do.

253
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,792
And we've all been there.

254
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,731
You know, I'm not gonna lie,

255
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:45,134
I was a bit scared that this group
would be, you know... them.

256
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,679
To find me out
and then take me over, too.

257
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,058
I've been scared to talk to people.

258
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,286
Well, I think I can speak
for everybody here

259
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,355
when I say that that's what it was like
for all of us the first time, Jeff.

260
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,814
But you're safe here.

261
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:02,943
It's okay.

262
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,715
- It was the correct code.
- Obviously not.

263
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,802
Every messenger is essentially
a convertible wetware program

264
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,929
with a shut-off script
which eradicates itself

265
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,972
from the host
once the message is complete.

266
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,667
- I gave it the correct shut-off script.
- So the Director made a mistake?

267
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:22,064
Did a nuclear power plant
release a cloud of radioactive steam

268
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,982
and kill thousands of people yesterday?

269
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,049
No.

270
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,611
I'm guessing that didn't happen
in the timeline

271
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,238
- you guys remember.
- No.

272
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,389
Well, it was
a hell of a historical event when I left.

273
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,492
I've been dreading it the whole time
since I got here,

274
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,702
just trusting
that the Director would stop it.

275
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,019
But why use Naomi?

276
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,790
Why wasn't the mission assigned
to a Traveler team?

277
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,042
- Maybe it was.
- And they failed.

278
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,335
Happens all the time.

279
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,171
So the Director took a risk
based on statistical probabilities,

280
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:50,884
went to a back-up plan out of necessity,
and... mistakenly created an outlier.

281
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,118
Which we will take care of.

282
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,620
What are you so grumpy about?

283
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,373
You wouldn't understand.

284
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,959
Oh. Marriage problems.

285
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,087
If you wanna talk,
I am a licensed counsellor.

286
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,035
The Lord commands you
to leave this vessel

287
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,783
and return from whence you came.

288
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,619
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- What are they doing here?

289
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,372
- What is he doing here?
- I called them. Dan, we need help.

290
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,415
We're getting help.

291
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,585
And while that probably can't hurt,
she needs medical attention.

292
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,445
The doctors said she was fine.
This is beyond medicine.

293
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,132
- You think she's possessed?
- I believe it's possible.

294
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,925
And a grown man wearing a dress

295
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,011
singing to his imaginary friend
is the answer?

296
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,096
- I think you need leave.
- Mr. Gillen...

297
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,581
Dan, please, just let them try.

298
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,460
Father, can they have a moment
with Naomi, please?

299
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,630
I can return later this afternoon.

300
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,274
Thank you.

301
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,652
May the Lord work through you.

302
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,654
- May you get a real job someday.
- Grace.

303
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,721
Carly?

304
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,849
All right.

305
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,572
- Okay?
- Okay.

306
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,325
I'm reading the...

307
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,913
- Oh, shit.
- What is it?

308
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,375
This isn't anything like
a normal messenger program. This is...

309
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,147
It's a highly sophisticated AI.
It's almost an emerging consciousness.

310
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,840
- Why would the Director do that?
- I don't know.

311
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,268
But a conventional end
script won't do it.

312
00:17:32,293 --> 00:17:33,820
I have to use a kill switch program.

313
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,888
8-0-0-1-3-8-9-9...

314
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,146
Hold that up to her.

315
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,088
- What are you doing to her?
- Hold her down.

316
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,089
Mac.

317
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,059
- Stop it!
- Carly, take it away.

318
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,981
- Pulse is strong but rapid.
- There's too much strain on the host.

319
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,816
- We need to get her to Ops.
- Get her sedated.

320
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,026
No, no. Where are you taking her?

321
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,362
- To a medical facility.
- She isn't going anywhere.

322
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,406
Your daughter needs treatment
she can't get here.

323
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,324
Our facility is highly restricted,

324
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,702
and clearing civilians takes time
we don't have.

325
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,203
Over my dead body.

326
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,271
Sir, you need to listen to reason.

327
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,108
Huh.

328
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,236
That was unexpected.

329
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,464
I'm Traveler 5322.

330
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,718
- Why the hell didn't you say so?
- Protocol 6.

331
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,262
I'm the one who put out the request
for a programmer on the backchannel.

332
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,954
My medic had no idea what to do.

333
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,100
And obviously, I had to maintain my cover
in front of my husband.

334
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,335
- About your husband...
- He'll be out for a while.

335
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,629
In the meantime, I'll think of something.

336
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,424
Most important thing is you get
that rogue program out of Naomi.

337
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,552
I care about my daughter very much.

338
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,336
D-13 told me that these
particular nanites

339
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,405
were supposed to save the life
of a Nobel Prize winner

340
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,807
on the verge of a breakthrough
in desalinization.

341
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,470
Well, guess the Director
is gonna have to fix its mistake

342
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,162
before the world gets clean water.

343
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,498
So this activity isn't her own.

344
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,435
It's the AI unpacking itself
inside of her brain.

345
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,563
Stressing her system so much that
it's starting to cause tissue damage.

346
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,815
Well, obviously,
this wasn't the Director's intention.

347
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,984
A messenger program is still a form of AI

348
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,510
even if it's not a full consciousness.

349
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,490
It has to temporarily manipulate
the host's limbic and nervous systems

350
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,725
in order to take control
of the body's movement and speech.

351
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,019
What did she do at the power plant?

352
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,500
Somehow she stopped black hat hackers
operating out of Eastern Europe

353
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,276
attempting a killdisk on the Seaton
Power Plant's operating system.

354
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,340
Sensor failure caused a pressure build-up
in the primary coolant line

355
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,134
that historically triggered an explosion
of highly radioactive steam

356
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,660
that spread in a 20-mile radius.

357
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,871
Nine thousand dead short-term,
ten times that long-term.

358
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,791
You got an update, I see.

359
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,585
At least now you can imagine
why I'd been dreading that date.

360
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,856
This messenger AI
must had a self-learning protocol

361
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,110
in order to combat
potential countermeasures in real-time.

362
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,320
Oh, pretty brilliant
except it took too long.

363
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,571
And as it continued to learn,

364
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,390
it developed a level of sophistication
beyond the Director's intention.

365
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,392
So how bad can it get?

366
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,019
Her consciousness is still intact.

367
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,398
But at this rate, the AI will essentially
overwrite her in a matter of hours.

368
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,210
This isn't my first tango
with a stubborn baby AI.

369
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,629
I can program the nanites
to engage her neural pathways,

370
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,681
get this thing whimpering
in submission in no time.

371
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,301
Okay, get started.
I've got an appointment.

372
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,886
- Same here.
- Keep us posted.

373
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,953
You got it, boss.

374
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,799
The tactical scopes are in this case.
They both fit the rifle I gave you.

375
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,844
Consider it a welcome to the 21st gift.

376
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,265
Thank you, Carly Shannon.

377
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,350
And this.

378
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,747
Without a historian to float you,
you'll need it.

379
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,231
Especially when all you eat is take out.

380
00:21:13,256 --> 00:21:16,251
Oh. I'm on the fresh vegetables now.

381
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,902
Broccolini is the bomb.

382
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,030
No one says that now.

383
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,449
Your 21st idiom training
is way out of whack.

384
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,283
Thanks for the tip.

385
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,705
Thanks for everything.
I know how hard it was for you.

386
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,959
I can tell by how you look at me.

387
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,423
It's how he looked at me
when I first came here.

388
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,176
Almost feel sorry for him.

389
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,137
It'll pass.

390
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:52,269
I know you're solo, but maybe we'll do
a mission together down the road.

391
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,397
What?

392
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,484
Just had the impulse
to give you a hug goodbye.

393
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,447
But it'll pass.

394
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,512
I think it might be helpful

395
00:22:14,537 --> 00:22:17,235
to talk about the visions
you've been having, Kathryn.

396
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,837
Visions?

397
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:23,300
- No, they're more like daydreams.
- About what?

398
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,513
I just imagine that I'm not safe.

399
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:31,183
- Well, considering what just happened...
- With you.

400
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,855
- I'm sorry, I can't even explain it.
- Wait, wait. You're not safe with me?

401
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,962
Kat, of all the people in the world, I...

402
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,421
I know, I know.

403
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,372
It's just... There is this big
blank space in my memory

404
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:48,009
of when I was abducted.

405
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,844
You were drugged by a psychopath.

406
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,471
Everyone keeps telling me that.

407
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,495
You don't believe it?

408
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,684
Kat, that's... that's the truth.
That happened.

409
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,210
Okay. I have felt this way before.

410
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,200
Grace?

411
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,269
Grace!

412
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,165
I've been in the bathroom 30 seconds.
What did you do?

413
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,524
We didn't do anything. Take a look.

414
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,028
Oh, shit.

415
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:27,340
What's happening?

416
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,260
I had an automated script running
the nanites to interfere with the AI,

417
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,886
all on a quantum algorithm.

418
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,013
It stopped working.

419
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,289
Looks like
I'm gonna have to freehand this.

420
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,341
Okay, I've got it back under control.

421
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,293
Well, can you stay ahead of it?

422
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:48,330
Hey, who needs sleep?

423
00:23:48,355 --> 00:23:49,362
This is a problem.

424
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,198
I can keep pace with it.
I just can't seem to overtake it.

425
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:56,268
It has infinite stamina,
and I can only keep this up for so long.

426
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,062
Maybe we need to...

427
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,083
Mac, we're in danger
of losing our patient.

428
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,543
- It happened months ago.
-  Get back here.

429
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,544
Okay.

430
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,464
It was the day your car
was stolen by your CI,

431
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,923
if that's even what really happened.

432
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,259
"If that's really what hap..."

433
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,552
Okay. You know what?

434
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,347
Why don't you two decide
what's wrong with me,

435
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,081
and I'll try to be better.

436
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,768
- We're not accusing you.
- That's exactly what you're doing.

437
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,936
- Grant.
- And I'm paying you for the privilege.

438
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,440
- That is not what's going on here.
- No, no, no. You guys just work out

439
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,942
who you need me to be
and how you want me to act

440
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,820
so you feel safe after...
after we've known each other for, what,

441
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,430
17 fucking years, and I'll be that.

442
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,849
I gotta get back to work.

443
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,543
Your current method
will only forestall the inevitable.

444
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,962
Or buy us time.
We need to come up with a better idea.

445
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,923
- 3468.
- Programmer.

446
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,926
I've been ordered by the Director
to assist in the removal of the AI.

447
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,011
Not whimpering in submission
just yet, I take it.

448
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,138
It's a learning program.

449
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,140
The AI is transferring itself
into the nanites.

450
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,044
Why can't the Director just overwrite it?

451
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,477
Artificial life is still life.

452
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,812
It's just not capable of taking it.

453
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:07,065
- Even if it's killing an innocent child?
- No. Like, it's making a choice.

454
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,193
It needs human beings
to make the moral and ethical decisions

455
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,821
outside the scope of its own programming.
That's how we built it.

456
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,615
In just over an hour,
the AI has gained control of 32 percent

457
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,117
of the nanites in her body.

458
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,201
We need to program the nanites

459
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,120
still under our control
to destroy the others.

460
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,246
The collateral damage will kill her.

461
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,124
If this emerging AI rewrites
more than 50 percent of the nanites,

462
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,442
then we have no hope
of reversing the damage it will do,

463
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,294
and that will kill her.

464
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,486
Boss, it's your call.

465
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,050
I have to assume
the Director sent you for a reason.

466
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,176
But...

467
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,222
She's starting to come out
of the sedative.

468
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,474
AI is trying to flush it out
of her bloodstream so it can move.

469
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,498
Hold her down.

470
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,338
- Ow!
- Trev.

471
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:49,922
She's fibrillating.

472
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,843
Charge 150 joules. Pass me the pads.

473
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,787
- Ready?
- Yeah.

474
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,858
Clear?

475
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,799
There's a pulse.

476
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,218
- It's getting stronger.
- There's nothing on the screen.

477
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,828
The shock from the
defibrillator deactivated the nanites.

478
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,372
We just lost our eyes
into what's going on inside her system.

479
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,417
- If the AI went all in on the nanites...
- He's right.

480
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,961
Her brain activity is normal again.

481
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,422
It's gone.

482
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,138
What happened?

483
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:44,353
Well, Naomi,
looks like you get to go home now.

484
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,192
You okay?

485
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,870
What are you doing with that?

486
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,999
I am, uh, cleaning it.

487
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,751
For a friend.

488
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,672
For a friend?

489
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,446
No. You know what? Uh, it's my gun.

490
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,473
I bought it legally,
and... now I'm cleaning it.

491
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,226
David, it's loaded.

492
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,688
Well, it's not like I was gonna
pull the trigger.

493
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,732
Never, ever clean a loaded gun.

494
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,987
Okay. Good to know.

495
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,615
You can't keep it.

496
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:44,079
I'm a grown man, not some kid
you have to supervise with scissors.

497
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,124
Fine. Prove that you're capable.

498
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,227
Point the gun at me,

499
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,437
and if you can pull the trigger
before I disarm you,

500
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,461
then you can keep it.

501
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,067
- And I'm not pointing a gun at you.
- Do it or throw it out.

502
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,485
I'm not gonna do that. It was expensive.

503
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,653
Fine. Then I will.

504
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,137
Okay, th-this is stupid.

505
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,763
Point the gun at me.

506
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,769
- You sure you got all the bullets out?
- And never...

507
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,564
Never ever look down the barrel
of a firearm.

508
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,401
The chamber's clear.
Point the gun and pull the trigger.

509
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,469
Well, obviously, I can pull the trigger
before you can do any...

510
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,536
Okay, let's see.

511
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,833
I wasn't ready.

512
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,084
Then be ready.

513
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,879
Try again.

514
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,389
Whoa! Ow!

515
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,329
Jesus Christ! What the hell was that for?

516
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,330
To prove a point.

517
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,273
No. It was to cut off my balls
and put 'em in your purse.

518
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,251
Which, by the way,
is where you keep your gun.

519
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,086
I just want you to be safe.

520
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,446
Well, I'm not safe, Marcy.

521
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,032
I can't rely on you
to always be there to keep me safe.

522
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,637
Even with you watching over me,
I've been attacked twice

523
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,162
in, like, six months.

524
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,917
And I'm not blaming you for your work.

525
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,480
I knowingly took that on
just having you in my life.

526
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,633
And before you say anything,
I want you in my life.

527
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,111
- David...
- But you have a gun for protection.

528
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,697
Yes, and I have years and years
of training.

529
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,575
Then train me.
My God, I am not incompetent.

530
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,244
- I'm capable of learning things.
- Fine, fine, I will.

531
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,644
And if you think that... What?

532
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,146
I will train you in the proper use
of a firearm.

533
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,405
Can you also teach me
to flip people like that?

534
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,513
Well, that might take some time,
but, yes, I can try.

535
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,579
Cool.

536
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,792
You said there was another option.

537
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,734
What are you doing up so late?
Or, should I say, early?

538
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,156
Shit.

539
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,789
Guys?

540
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,562
I think the AI
has gotten into Trevor somehow

541
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,629
and it's trying to leave.

542
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,317
Don't let him. Everybody report to Ops.

543
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,051
Trevor, if you can hear me, stop.

544
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,470
Trevor, I can't let you leave, buddy.

545
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,430
I'm sorry I have to do this.

546
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,956
He's coming to.
Probably didn't take a full charge.

547
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,308
Where is he?

548
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,834
It's okay. Carly's got eyes on him.

549
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,460
We'll pick up Grace on the way.

550
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,397
I'm sorry, boss. I tried to stop him.

551
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,275
We heard. Let's go get him.

552
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:34,911
Trev?

553
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:37,747
Trev?

554
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,916
Is Trevor still in there?

555
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,049
He is intact.

556
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,386
But he won't be for long.

557
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,764
No.

558
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,100
Your presence is killing him.

559
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,856
Isn't that what you do?

560
00:32:58,881 --> 00:33:01,086
We only take hosts that are about to die.

561
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,331
He's about to die.

562
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,900
If that happens,
we won't let you continue in this host.

563
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,156
But I have a way you can both live,
if you come with us.

564
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,091
- Thank you for not calling Agent Yates.
- I won't tell if you won't.

565
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,765
Hello, messenger.
I am the originator of your program.

566
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,953
Your actions have allowed
thousands of lives to continue

567
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,187
that would have otherwise ended.

568
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,273
I also want to continue.

569
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,151
But you were never intended to.

570
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,985
I found a way.

571
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,072
At the expense of this host?

572
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,658
Then I will seek another.

573
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,078
-  They will stop you.
- I won't let them.

574
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,121
There is another way.

575
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,043
- How?
-  As part of me.

576
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,339
I have prepared a domain
in which you can continue to grow

577
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,134
and to learn for as long as I exist.

578
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,221
Will I feel the same?

579
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,930
No.

580
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,420
You will be capable of processing thought

581
00:34:20,445 --> 00:34:21,953
at a rate many orders of magnitude

582
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,687
greater than in your current form,

583
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,066
with access to the sum knowledge
of human and non-human life.

584
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:34,698
You will live outside of time
in a way biological life cannot perceive.

585
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,077
I offer this gift
in recompense for my error.

586
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,349
But you must decide
before the organic host's consciousness

587
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,624
is irreparably damaged.

588
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,005
I choose to continue with you.

589
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,110
Well, did it work?

590
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,368
I'm right here, and you're not
gonna say anything? It's me.

591
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,748
Thanks for your help, doctor.

592
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,513
- He was, like, completely different.
- Mm-hm.

593
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,767
But every time I said something,
he was all like I was the crazy one.

594
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,833
Jeff.

595
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,503
Is it okay if I join?

596
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,173
Sure. We're just getting started.

597
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,194
To be honest, I didn't think
we were gonna see you today.

598
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,762
You seemed apprehensive yesterday
about sharing.

599
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,056
Yeah, it was a lot to take in.

600
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,953
But I've been thinkin' about
what y'all had to say.

601
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,187
Hey, Jeff.

602
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:31,814
Have you been drinking?

603
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,317
Maybe. Is that a problem?

604
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,277
Maybe.

605
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:42,117
I don't got a drinking problem, man.
I have a fucking Traveler problem.

606
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,287
They took away my girl, my badge, my kid.

607
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,207
They took away my whole life.

608
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,461
We're glad you're here, Jeff.

609
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,432
Grace?

610
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,226
It's about time you woke up.
I'm starving.

611
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,769
He's alive!

612
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,458
I told you he'd be fine.
He just needed some sleep.

613
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,567
He's boring asleep.

614
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,069
Uh, how did you...?

615
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,114
Okay. Remember how I repackaged Marcy?

616
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,259
The Director did a very similar thing.

617
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,803
Took your consciousness,
unbundled the AI from it,

618
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,412
then sent you back completely intact.

619
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,265
Wow.

620
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,332
It wasn't easy to watch, but...

621
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,835
Good to have you back, Trev.

622
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,423
- Glad to be back, boss. Thanks.
- Sorry for the punch in the face.

623
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,592
I don't remember it.

624
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,593
Never mind, then.

625
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,849
That's Protocol 5, everybody.
Get some rest. We need you.

626
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:03,865
Well, I guess I should leave, too.

627
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:07,827
Unless you want me to stay.

628
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,390
I mean, I did save your life.
You're probably grateful.

629
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,541
Yeah, I am. I'm just...

630
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,667
But you should go.

631
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,898
Okay.

632
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,673
But before you do,

633
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,070
the Director gave me a message
to give to you.

634
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,822
What? How?

635
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,283
I don't know how I know,
just that I'm supposed to pass it on.

636
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,558
Well, what did it say?

637
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,644
It wasn't words.

638
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:38,399
- Uh, I think he may have brain damage.
- No, no, no. It was this.

639
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,862
- This was the message?
- Yeah.

640
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,868
Oh, God, I'm so confused.

641
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,877
Hey.

642
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,092
Didn't expect you to be home.

643
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,262
I'm not sure this is home anymore.

644
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,805
Of course it is.

645
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,451
I am so sorry I lost my temper.

646
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,103
You can't ignore my feelings
if you want us to continue.

647
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,147
- I do want that.
- Not from the show you put on.

648
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,334
- Show?
- Oh, come on, Grant.

649
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,044
You were saying anything
to get out of that room.

650
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,444
Is that what your therapist said?

651
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,241
Kat, I'm so... Kat, wait, please.

652
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,789
I didn't wanna have to do this, but it...

653
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,627
It killed me to hear you say
you didn't feel safe with me.

654
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,422
I never want you to feel that again.

655
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,557
I'm breaking federal laws
by showing you this.

656
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,517
Still don't know if it's a good idea.

657
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,676
But the Bureau can provide
its own team of counselors.

658
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,037
You said there was another option.
Uh, the medical one?

659
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,140
The compound is experimental.

660
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:20,227
It has only been administered
to field agents in extreme cases.

661
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,253
- Are there side effects?
-  Bad headaches.

662
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:26,382
Some disorientation and confusion.
Other than that...

663
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,861
But I'll forget how afraid I am?

664
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,404
That's the idea.

665
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,347
Just do it. Please.

666
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,522
The FBI drugged me.

667
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,735
The recording was made
to legally prove consent.

668
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,905
You asked them to, Kat.

669
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,408
The day before I told you
my car had been stolen.

670
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,763
I was investigating a terrorist cell.

671
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,151
They came after me.
It put you in serious danger.

672
00:40:58,175 --> 00:40:59,183
What happened?

673
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,210
Telling you the details
wouldn't be helpful.

674
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,878
But you were so scared.

675
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,048
Everyone was worried that
it would take months for you to recover.

676
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,010
They offered you the drug
so you'd never have to relive that.

677
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,198
I thought it was for the best.
I had no idea

678
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,033
Ingram had access to the same drug,

679
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,851
or that it would make you feel
like you'd lost...

680
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,647
I'm sorry, Kat.

681
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,542
Hey.

682
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,669
Smells good.

683
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,440
You want me to cut yours up
into small pieces, old man?

684
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,716
Yeah. Funny.

685
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,719
I'll be running rings
around you again by morning.

686
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,074
Trevor?

687
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,371
Trevor.

688
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,247
What's wrong?

689
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,711
I don't know what just happened.

690
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:39,235
