1
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:31,654
Joanne...

2
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,893
Listen to me carefully.

3
00:01:00,676 --> 00:01:02,487
- Who are you?
- Explain who did this.

4
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:04,511
You killed my husband.

5
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:07,531
Hey, slow down a little.

6
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,584
You can scream at the
top of your lungs,

7
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:10,870
they're not gonna wake up for hours.

8
00:01:10,894 --> 00:01:12,455
Yeah, but Carly's baby might.

9
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,279
The kid just settled down.
He's been traumatized enough.

10
00:01:20,237 --> 00:01:21,637
It'll work out, boss.

11
00:01:22,322 --> 00:01:23,372
Sure it will.

12
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:28,424
Maybe we should go over our story
one more time.

13
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,090
Not for my sake, obviously.

14
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:43,074
Vincent?

15
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:47,045
Vincent, where are you?

16
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:51,948
I'm right here, Simon. Can you hear me?

17
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:54,469
- You're in my head.
- In a way.

18
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:56,362
I've given you a comm.

19
00:01:57,107 --> 00:02:00,640
Now close your eyes.
That's the most important rule.

20
00:02:03,488 --> 00:02:05,688
Good. Make sure they stay closed.

21
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:07,885
I've sent people for you.

22
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:11,264
You said you were gonna fix me.

23
00:02:11,288 --> 00:02:13,016
And that's just what we're going to do.

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,851
Then why are you taking me away?

25
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,561
The Director is testing you.

26
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:17,985
The device works now!

27
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:22,069
I did what you said!
Multiple uses, multiple transfers!

28
00:02:22,632 --> 00:02:25,898
And it's going to be put to good use,
I promise.

29
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:27,269
You've done well.

30
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:29,271
I'm cold.

31
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:32,123
I know. This won't take much longer.

32
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,913
I don't like this place.
I wanna go home.

33
00:02:35,937 --> 00:02:38,337
This is the test. Remember the rule.

34
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:39,865
Eyes closed.

35
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:45,734
You've been very helpful to me, Simon,
and I will always be grateful.

36
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,322
- Are you ready?
- No! I wanna go home!

37
00:02:49,993 --> 00:02:53,126
- Be strong, now.
- You said you would fix me!

38
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:54,354
I am fixing you.

39
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:04,698
You promised me!

40
00:03:27,614 --> 00:03:29,100
Your host had been so loyal,

41
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,427
I just couldn't bring
myself to kill him.

42
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:34,889
But I knew the Director
would have no such compunction.

43
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:36,246
Welcome to the 21st.

44
00:04:39,895 --> 00:04:40,945
There he is!

45
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:44,730
Oh, Jesus, keep it down a bit, man.

46
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:50,214
- How did I get here?
- I took your keys.

47
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:51,288
Made you crash.

48
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,273
You were "celebrating."

49
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:59,427
Well, I must've had a good time, Phil,
'cause...

50
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:03,895
I don't remember how I got here
or what we were celebrating.

51
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,852
You were in trouble with a loan shark,
uh, named Varghese.

52
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,640
Oh, right.

53
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:12,924
I got picked up by a couple of his boys.

54
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:15,031
I don't remember what
happened after that.

55
00:05:15,055 --> 00:05:17,283
Well, they gave you 24 hours
to come up with the money.

56
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:19,702
You came to me,
asked me to place some bets,

57
00:05:19,726 --> 00:05:23,039
we came here to watch them come in
and hilarity ensued.

58
00:05:23,063 --> 00:05:25,396
- You really don't remember?
- No.

59
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:28,419
I maybe forgot to tell you
I probably shouldn't drink.

60
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:29,795
Oh, we established that.

61
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:31,419
But, my hungover friend,

62
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:35,547
you're out of the hole
with a little extra.

63
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,969
Oh, I owe Varghese more than this.

64
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,809
Well, he's been paid.
That's... That's the extra.

65
00:05:43,833 --> 00:05:44,883
Fuck off.

66
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,277
Man, I love you. Oh, come here.

67
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:53,339
Ray, that's, uh...
what friends are for.

68
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:29,769
Agent Yates.

69
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:31,296
Please, take a seat.

70
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:41,171
First, let me say
how sorry I am for your loss.

71
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:44,407
- I know from experience.
- Thank you, sir.

72
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:46,153
I'm fine.

73
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:48,249
Good.

74
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:51,502
Then please explain your request
that I issue a cancellation order

75
00:06:51,526 --> 00:06:54,792
of a highly classified,
highly complex operation

76
00:06:55,238 --> 00:06:58,009
of which you should have had
zero knowledge

77
00:06:58,033 --> 00:07:01,833
and which is scheduled to begin
worldwide in 23 minutes?

78
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:05,611
The request isn't mine, sir.
It's from the Director.

79
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,932
- He is the FBI director.
- Last I checked.

80
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,560
I think everyone in this room knows
to which director I'm referring.

81
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:17,570
How was this communicated to you?

82
00:07:17,594 --> 00:07:19,113
It began several days ago.

83
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,803
And you waited until now?

84
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:25,286
Sir, if I can explain my reasoning
for not coming to you sooner.

85
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,443
Go ahead, Agent Yates.
Start at the beginning.

86
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:35,217
Boss, Ray is taken care of.

87
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:37,428
So the memory inhibitor worked.

88
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,863
He was the easy one.

89
00:07:39,032 --> 00:07:40,634
That and the cash.

90
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:42,970
Now you can get back
to cleaning up our mess.

91
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,260
- On it.
- Tanner.

92
00:07:44,454 --> 00:07:45,504
Mac.

93
00:07:46,247 --> 00:07:49,185
Lot of people here,
they can't all be Travelers.

94
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,259
Nowhere near.

95
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:54,260
But Wakefield handpicked them,
they're good agents.

96
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,574
- How's it going up there?
- Same as 20 minutes ago.

97
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,453
David and Jeff are just taking a break
to get some medical attention.

98
00:08:07,477 --> 00:08:09,747
- I thought we'd be on by now.
- These things take time.

99
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:11,771
Maybe you could go for a walk.

100
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:12,850
We just did.

101
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,394
Then go for another walk because
we're having a private conversation.

102
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:19,379
Sorry to interrupt.

103
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,040
Where were we?

104
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,220
- I think we were done.
- No, no, no. Um...

105
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:26,844
We were talking about your... feelings.

106
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,725
- You were talking about my feelings.
- Right.

107
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:31,349
The logic's inescapable.

108
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:34,855
001 kidnapped every significant other
on your team.

109
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,479
Mnh-mnh. Philip and Ray?

110
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:38,442
- Oh, I don't judge.
- Yeah, you do.

111
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:39,693
- Look, Trev.
- Trev?

112
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:42,405
It's obvious I was taken by 001,

113
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,295
held against my will,
and frankly starved.

114
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:46,532
We were only given water

115
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,285
- for what seemed like days.
- Thirty-one hours.

116
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,149
Because of the inevitable impact

117
00:08:50,174 --> 00:08:53,266
it was gonna have on you...
emotionally.

118
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:58,337
I'm important to you
in a way neither one of us foresaw.

119
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,827
And the sooner we both accept that...

120
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:02,998
Grace,

121
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:06,101
I am delighted you
were the one kidnapped

122
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,665
and interrogated, not my parents.

123
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:10,446
There, I said it. So...

124
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:13,686
That is the second nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

125
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,776
So can I go now?

126
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:17,611
Oh, no, no, no. Your team needs you.

127
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:19,973
I'll go.

128
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,228
Oh.

129
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:26,804
It's thrilling, isn't it?

130
00:09:27,724 --> 00:09:32,057
The primal rush of hormones
bursting from your endocrine system.

131
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,750
Remember we're much, much older
than these bodies.

132
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:39,774
And I can't wait to try them out.

133
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,291
You train for years
to be a part of the grand plan.

134
00:09:57,337 --> 00:09:58,470
Studied medicine.

135
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:00,222
Combat.

136
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,820
Finally, you get assigned a team
over hundreds of other volunteers.

137
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:07,977
And all you can think about
is your boyfriend.

138
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,645
I hope I never see Jeff again.

139
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,168
You can still make work.
He won't remember the last 24 hours.

140
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:21,545
Please. They're gonna need to forget
a hell of a lot more than that

141
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:22,838
and you know it, Marcy.

142
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,757
It's what we've got to work with.

143
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,842
They'll definitely remember
being abducted.

144
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:28,093
Meeting each other.

145
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:29,845
Maybe even their first session
with Perrow.

146
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:31,222
How do we even know she'll cooperate?

147
00:10:31,246 --> 00:10:33,012
She's already made a statement,

148
00:10:33,037 --> 00:10:35,059
saying that her actions
were under duress.

149
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,894
Beyond that,
she wants nothing to do with us.

150
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:38,145
Frankly, I don't blame her.

151
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,313
As far as Perrow's concerned,

152
00:10:39,337 --> 00:10:41,899
Vincent Ingram
was a deeply paranoid serial killer

153
00:10:41,923 --> 00:10:44,652
who thought that time travelers
from the future were out to get him.

154
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:45,726
Crazy talk.

155
00:10:46,094 --> 00:10:49,615
Fortunately, no mainstream news outlet's
taking it seriously.

156
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,451
And once the new Traveler in Ingram
confesses he went off his meds...

157
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:54,954
Yeah, but, see, you make it
sound ridiculous.

158
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:58,457
Hey, I'm from the future,
I'm not sure I buy it myself.

159
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:00,481
Jeff sure as hell believed it.

160
00:11:01,025 --> 00:11:02,075
So did David.

161
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:05,756
- No. What is that? What is that?
- Let go of me.

162
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,446
So did your wife.

163
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:13,722
Which is why we have to make sure
our stories are straight.

164
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:15,849
So we can all get back
to our Protocol 5.

165
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,352
- Oh! This is about Protocol 5?
- That is the mission.

166
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:19,979
Oh, now you care about the mission.

167
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:21,522
What is that supposed to mean?

168
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:24,346
You risked the entire
Traveler program...

169
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:26,433
for her.

170
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,243
And you did the same.

171
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:31,365
What do you think,
you can just undo all of this?

172
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,722
- Just put it all back into a box?
- We try! Yes!

173
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:37,997
Shit was about to hit the fan
anyway, Carly.

174
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:39,214
Exposure was imminent,

175
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:41,917
across every major
intelligence agency worldwide:

176
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:45,024
CIA, FSB, Interpol.

177
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:48,090
All we did was speed up the process.

178
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:50,301
- Then we need to move.
- No. The Director sent us here.

179
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:53,304
The Director has been making it up
as it goes along, Marcy.

180
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:54,928
I think it's about time we all admit...

181
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:56,914
Keep your fucking voice down.

182
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:04,315
The point is, what
happened was inevitable

183
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,026
and obviously there's now a plan
in motion to deal with that.

184
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,450
Meantime, we stick to the protocols.

185
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:17,207
You gonna order me to stay with him?

186
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:22,485
You gonna tell me what the bruising
on your knuckles is all about?

187
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,753
Hey, guys! Grace just left.

188
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:27,796
I was about to rustle up some lunch.

189
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,086
I do a mean veggie stir fry, boss.

190
00:12:31,532 --> 00:12:33,665
Does it have to be mean?

191
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:36,221
I just wanna go home!

192
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:37,723
And we're gonna take you home.

193
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:40,851
But you've been kidnapped,
held against your will,

194
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,935
probably brainwashed.

195
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:44,897
Apparently by a man I met
at a charity auction a decade ago,

196
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:46,721
as if that makes any sense.

197
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:50,319
At least tell me some things
I wanna know.

198
00:12:50,343 --> 00:12:53,781
Like, where are we? And how long
have I been in these clothes?

199
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:57,538
An FBI safe house in the country,
and... a couple days.

200
00:12:57,892 --> 00:13:00,704
Kathryn, you were found unconscious
yesterday

201
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:02,706
in a room with four other people:

202
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,501
David Mailer, Jeff Conniker,
Ray Green and...

203
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:07,251
All of them claimed to know my husband.

204
00:13:07,276 --> 00:13:08,921
There. See?

205
00:13:08,945 --> 00:13:10,011
New information.

206
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,883
Exactly why we have to keep
talking this through.

207
00:13:12,907 --> 00:13:14,093
You've been through a traumatic ordeal

208
00:13:14,117 --> 00:13:15,577
and without proper debriefing,

209
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:17,429
you could suffer
long-term consequences.

210
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:18,639
This is what we do

211
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:22,684
if something like this happens
to any one of our agents in the field.

212
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,508
What's the first thing you remember
about the abduction?

213
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,889
His men...

214
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:30,531
They were twins.

215
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:32,534
Also new information.

216
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:36,211
We woke up in a room with five chairs.

217
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:40,364
And then they took us out one by one
to talk a woman.

218
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:42,251
- A doctor.
- Dr. Perrow.

219
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:45,249
- Yes.
- She was there against her will, too.

220
00:13:45,273 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh, God, they have her daughter.

221
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:51,157
- They're fine, we've been in contact.
- Oh, that poor woman.

222
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,256
You know what, that's it,
that's all I remember.

223
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:00,103
Why did they drug me?

224
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:05,310
To move you to another location.
It's lucky MacLaren found you.

225
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:08,355
We can give you something
for the headache.

226
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:11,150
No. I don't like to take pills.
Can I see him now? Is Grant here yet?

227
00:14:11,174 --> 00:14:13,974
He's here and you will
see him very soon.

228
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,393
But first, I need you to go over
one more time

229
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:20,096
what you talked about in that room.

230
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,828
Hey! I need a ride,
who's the lucky driver?

231
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:25,778
The bus is for the 21sters.

232
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,780
Fine, let me take that one.

233
00:14:30,985 --> 00:14:33,985
Parsons, we need a driver, over.

234
00:14:35,364 --> 00:14:37,230
Parsons, what's your status?

235
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:39,784
How's your vision in this eye?

236
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:41,472
Well, can I see out of it? Yes.

237
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,896
Can I feel my pulse in it? Also yes.

238
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,866
Swelling's down, won't be pretty.

239
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,982
When I was a kid, I got a black eye

240
00:14:52,006 --> 00:14:53,609
the day before high school started.

241
00:14:53,633 --> 00:14:57,279
My mom said to tell everybody:
"You should see the other guy!"

242
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:02,367
You're not the other guy, are you?

243
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:04,857
If it was me, you'd look a lot worse.

244
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:08,685
Yeah, okay. Well, maybe you
should look in the mirror.

245
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:11,492
He's at the roadblock
down the road a ways,

246
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:12,606
his radio battery must be dead.

247
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:14,144
Never mind, I'll walk to him,

248
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:15,483
I've been cramped up
for days without...

249
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:16,557
You don't care.

250
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,837
We good to keep going?

251
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:26,631
All yours.

252
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,758
I'm not talking to no one else
until someone shows me my son.

253
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:34,441
I told you, Jeff Jr.
is being well taken care of.

254
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:37,265
And I told you that
that is unacceptable.

255
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:39,822
So is your attitude, Officer Conniker.

256
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:41,726
Okay, why don't you
give the guy a break,

257
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:42,990
we were kidnapped for chrissake.

258
00:15:43,015 --> 00:15:45,348
And I don't need your help neither.

259
00:15:46,394 --> 00:15:48,060
Come with me, Mr. Mailer.

260
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,541
Maybe ask him
why he's sleeping with the girl

261
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:52,631
who's in the care of the state.

262
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:27,859
Simon?

263
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:29,444
Traveler 5069.

264
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:32,405
You knew my host?

265
00:16:33,107 --> 00:16:34,157
Uh...

266
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:35,784
Yeah, I did.

267
00:16:36,652 --> 00:16:38,625
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised,

268
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,632
Simon's death wasn't in
the historical record.

269
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:43,510
My host was supposed to be
a John Doe, attempted suicide,

270
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:45,667
but obviously he was a Traveler.

271
00:16:46,412 --> 00:16:48,678
Have you ever seen a comm do this?

272
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,800
Ouch.

273
00:16:52,293 --> 00:16:53,687
Let me get you something for that.

274
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:56,273
Someone tried to speak to him.
I couldn't hear over the train.

275
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:58,963
It wasn't just any Traveler, he was 004.

276
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:03,030
Didn't know he had a comm, though.

277
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:05,115
There's some things you need to know
about him.

278
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:06,405
First things first.

279
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,702
We need to reactivate
that code you embedded

280
00:17:08,726 --> 00:17:12,392
in those obscene
confession recordings you made, ASAP.

281
00:17:12,897 --> 00:17:15,334
What were you people thinking anyway?

282
00:17:15,358 --> 00:17:17,920
I was thinking that we could locate
and erase the recordings

283
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:19,504
before they got out into the world,

284
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:21,256
but Vincent had countermeasures.

285
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,913
Of course the Director would have
devised a countermeasure for 001.

286
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:26,518
The Director can calculate in seconds,

287
00:17:26,543 --> 00:17:28,722
what would take a
lifetime for you or I.

288
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:31,412
I find... your lack of fealty offensive.

289
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,606
This body is dehydrated,
do you have water?

290
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:46,871
You should know,

291
00:17:47,556 --> 00:17:51,161
your host body suffers from extreme
paranoid schizophrenia.

292
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,551
Severe enough that our medic couldn't

293
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:55,118
synthesize a drug to prevent it.

294
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:58,293
Simon was pretty much incapable
of functioning in 21st society,

295
00:17:58,317 --> 00:17:59,917
let alone as a Traveler.

296
00:18:00,444 --> 00:18:05,110
You'll probably experience a psychotic
episode in the next few hours.

297
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:09,235
That's the body...

298
00:18:10,913 --> 00:18:12,713
the Director chose for you.

299
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:25,070
David, I know it's complicated...

300
00:18:25,094 --> 00:18:27,094
No, no, no. What's not to get?

301
00:18:27,513 --> 00:18:29,741
This Vincent Ingram character
had it in for Agent MacLaren

302
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:33,870
because MacLaren was onto his whole
torturing people in wheelchairs

303
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:35,038
and burying 'em alive fetish,

304
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:39,084
so Ingram kidnaps, drugs and/or
beats the crap out of anyone

305
00:18:39,108 --> 00:18:41,044
who's close to Agent MacLaren,

306
00:18:41,068 --> 00:18:44,548
with the likely intention
of, you know, doing the same to us.

307
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:45,966
- That's pretty much it.
- Right.

308
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,469
Except I'm not even remotely close
to Agent MacLaren.

309
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:51,304
In fact, I don't think he likes me.

310
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:52,931
He hasn't said he doesn't like you.

311
00:18:52,955 --> 00:18:54,099
You know what?

312
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,351
Mac and me,
we are just two different kinds of guys,

313
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,603
just one is no less
manly than the other.

314
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:01,160
Just two different kinds of manly men.

315
00:19:01,714 --> 00:19:03,275
- David.
- On the other hand,

316
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,653
if this is the new normal,
then I better buck up a little bit.

317
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:08,113
- You know what I mean?
- No.

318
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:10,365
Yeah. I better grow a pair of kahunas.

319
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:12,534
I'm pretty sure that's not the word,
but I'm gonna go with it,

320
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,245
because if I'm gonna hang out
with an FBI doctor,

321
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:18,123
I better pack on some muscle,
you know, maybe do some,

322
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:20,417
like, what is it,
is this Taekwondo, Pilates?

323
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:21,574
David, calm down.

324
00:19:24,236 --> 00:19:25,369
Agent Callahan...

325
00:19:25,946 --> 00:19:28,546
I have never been more calm in my life.

326
00:19:34,497 --> 00:19:35,547
Hello?

327
00:19:39,585 --> 00:19:40,635
Hello?

328
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:43,774
Hello?

329
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:45,442
Are you people seriously
gonna make me walk

330
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:47,500
- the rest of...
- Hands on the vehicle now!

331
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:48,820
- What the hell...?
- Turn around

332
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:51,323
and put your hands on the vehicle
or we'll take you down!

333
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:53,366
Don't let her touch the comm!

334
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,056
This is drop leader 31...

335
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:57,871
One of the primaries attempted
to leave containment on foot,

336
00:19:57,895 --> 00:19:59,428
we have her in custody.

337
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,634
This is Deputy Oslin. Yes?

338
00:20:08,155 --> 00:20:10,021
All right. Keep us apprised.

339
00:20:10,324 --> 00:20:13,220
We just captured
the Traveler designated 0027

340
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:15,430
attempting to escape before the assault.

341
00:20:15,454 --> 00:20:16,973
Did she activate her comm device?

342
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:18,558
If she has one, she didn't try.

343
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:19,915
Then we're still on.

344
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,814
You were saying
the Director communicated to you?

345
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:25,171
Yes, it spoke to me.

346
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:26,900
That's not possible.

347
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:29,528
The Director is only
capable of communicating directly

348
00:20:29,552 --> 00:20:31,321
through what they call "messengers."

349
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:32,572
Specifically, children.

350
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:36,326
Because for reasons we don't know,
the process kills an adult.

351
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,550
Apparently, it found another way.

352
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:47,327
Dr. Teslia?

353
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,164
Dr. Teslia?

354
00:20:51,782 --> 00:20:52,832
Yes.

355
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:55,793
Hi.

356
00:20:58,747 --> 00:20:59,797
And you're...?

357
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,060
The person you called
and insisted I come here

358
00:21:02,084 --> 00:21:03,270
as a matter of national security.

359
00:21:03,294 --> 00:21:04,894
I just forgot your name.

360
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:07,774
- Special Agent...
- Yates, yes, I knew that.

361
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:08,848
So...

362
00:21:09,425 --> 00:21:10,475
Come, come.

363
00:21:10,676 --> 00:21:11,726
So...

364
00:21:12,303 --> 00:21:13,353
This is Ilsa.

365
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:15,471
And Ilsa, this is...

366
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:17,367
Uh, what's your first name again?

367
00:21:17,391 --> 00:21:19,057
Good evening, Dr. Teslia.

368
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:21,246
Would you like to play
a nice game of chess?

369
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:25,513
No one ever gets that. Okay.

370
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,307
Ilsa is AI that replaces Boolean logic

371
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:31,506
with quantum law on
an algorithmic level.

372
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,551
There's maybe three others
as powerful in the whole world.

373
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:36,303
It gave you my cell number?

374
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:38,970
No. No, Ilsa is practically a newborn.

375
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:41,217
The Director gave me your number.

376
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:42,548
What Director?

377
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,525
That is the question.

378
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:46,927
All right, we're done.

379
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,938
I am very sorry
for your mother's diagnosis, Joanne.

380
00:21:55,888 --> 00:21:59,242
I just heard the news myself.
How would it know that?

381
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:01,399
That's the Director talking now.

382
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:04,414
It's taking over Ilsa to communicate.

383
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:06,458
You were chosen
among seven potential candidates

384
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:08,148
within this jurisdiction.

385
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,101
Okay, who are you?

386
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:14,382
A sentient multi-zettaflop
quantum frame

387
00:22:14,406 --> 00:22:17,472
speaking to you
from centuries in the future...

388
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:20,766
Matter of national security

389
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,130
...only recently possible

390
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:23,642
- because of...
- Okay, stop!

391
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:25,599
I don't know if this
is some kind of joke

392
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,062
or you're trying to sell me something,

393
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:30,315
but either way, you picked the wrong
person on the wrong goddamn day.

394
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:32,005
Agent Yates...

395
00:22:32,883 --> 00:22:35,149
Call me again and I'll arrest you.

396
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,220
I take it he called you again.

397
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:40,575
Actually, he sent me a text.

398
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:43,799
It just didn't make sense
until the next day...

399
00:22:44,103 --> 00:22:48,769
I was about to head out.
Maybe you should do the same.

400
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:51,075
Oh, I, um...

401
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:55,161
I wanna be here in case she wakes up.

402
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:01,834
Joanne... this last
stroke was extensive.

403
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:05,096
She won't be waking up again.

404
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,884
Well, I spoke to her
the day before yesterday.

405
00:23:18,637 --> 00:23:21,570
Here. Might as well
have something to read.

406
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:34,876
How could you know?

407
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,798
- What?
- You texted me yesterday.

408
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:38,383
- How did you know this would happen?
- I didn't!

409
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:41,344
I just texted
what the Director told me to text.

410
00:23:41,368 --> 00:23:43,892
- Wow.
- Well, I wanna talk to the Director.

411
00:23:43,925 --> 00:23:45,056
Yeah? Well, get in line!

412
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,518
I tried to all last night,
it wouldn't say a word to me.

413
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,520
Good morning, Joanne.

414
00:23:50,544 --> 00:23:52,098
Dude, I'm standing right here.

415
00:23:52,125 --> 00:23:53,245
How did you know?

416
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:55,098
From my time, the bird strike

417
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:57,610
and emergency landing of Flight 0718

418
00:23:57,634 --> 00:23:59,700
is a part of historical record.

419
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:01,828
As was your mother's diagnosis.

420
00:24:02,264 --> 00:24:04,264
- Have I convinced you?
- No.

421
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:06,453
What do you want from me?

422
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:08,413
To deliver a message to your superiors.

423
00:24:08,437 --> 00:24:09,518
Tell them yourself.

424
00:24:09,543 --> 00:24:11,056
I have no means of directly

425
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:14,210
communicating outside of this room.

426
00:24:14,234 --> 00:24:17,714
Ilsa is built inside an AI box,
it's completely cut off.

427
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:19,431
You can't just give a
potentially emerging

428
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,759
super-intelligence the car keys.

429
00:24:20,783 --> 00:24:23,116
You need to control what it learns.

430
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:25,552
What's the message?

431
00:24:25,829 --> 00:24:27,974
Your superiors
must order the cancellation

432
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:30,184
of the coordinated
assault planned tomorrow

433
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:32,062
on Traveler teams worldwide

434
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:36,152
or face an unstoppable series
of civilization ending events.

435
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:40,111
Discovery was inevitable
at this juncture of the grand plan.

436
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:42,655
Cooperation with the
21st century authorities

437
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,939
is now the optimal path.

438
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:48,359
You get that?

439
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:53,500
And you just left?

440
00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,204
Deputy Oslin...

441
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:56,762
did you believe in time travelers

442
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:58,772
the first time you were told?

443
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:00,538
Truthfully, no.

444
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:03,343
I reluctantly told the agent
who brought it to me

445
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:06,471
that he could pursue the matter,
but you're right,

446
00:25:06,495 --> 00:25:07,895
I didn't believe him.

447
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:10,934
- How did he convince you?
- He didn't.

448
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:14,958
The agent was overwritten
along with his entire task force.

449
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,778
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

450
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:23,404
Special Agent Wakefield told us

451
00:25:23,428 --> 00:25:25,573
he was on the verge
of providing the proof he needed...

452
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:28,785
The next day,
he was a different man. Literally.

453
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:30,745
The man I had worked alongside
for ten years

454
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:32,709
had been replaced by an impostor.

455
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,890
How?

456
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,000
A traveler
supplants a host consciousness

457
00:25:36,024 --> 00:25:39,879
with his or her own,
then pretends as if nothing's changed.

458
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:41,631
When Wakefield called us that evening

459
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:45,385
ostensibly to assure me that his task
force had found nothing,

460
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:47,542
we knew he'd become one of them.

461
00:25:48,537 --> 00:25:52,737
I take it the Director didn't share
that information with you.

462
00:25:53,792 --> 00:25:54,842
No.

463
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,226
It's how they come here
from their own time. It's... insidious.

464
00:25:59,756 --> 00:26:00,806
It's murder.

465
00:26:00,924 --> 00:26:04,070
And the reason this operation
must continue on schedule,

466
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:07,227
however much you try
to convince us otherwise.

467
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:12,965
- You don't think that I'm...?
- Never met you before, Agent Yates.

468
00:26:13,896 --> 00:26:15,096
How would we know?

469
00:26:19,443 --> 00:26:22,714
Seasoned with exotic spices
from all around the world.

470
00:26:22,738 --> 00:26:26,004
- Ellis had a whole rack of 'em.
- Thanks, Trev.

471
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,857
Hey, wanted to give you an update on...

472
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:44,614
Oh. Uh, I haven't eaten in hours,
would you mind if...?

473
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,293
Be my guest.

474
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:56,821
Mm.

475
00:26:59,358 --> 00:27:00,691
Mm, this is amazing.

476
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:02,962
What spice is that?

477
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:04,179
All of them.

478
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,121
Mm.

479
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:08,546
- You mentioned an update?
- Right.

480
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:12,347
Okay, so we, uh,
we think we're in the clear

481
00:27:12,371 --> 00:27:15,808
as far as the recordings
are concerned across the board.

482
00:27:15,832 --> 00:27:17,258
Obviously, they're still traumatized,

483
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:19,896
but the inhibitor wiped
the worst of it.

484
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,981
Who knows how David's gonna handle this?

485
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:23,871
David's fine. He's chatty...

486
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:25,933
Uh-oh.

487
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:27,695
He and Kathryn
will be ready for you soon.

488
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:30,119
But, uh, Jeff's a different story...

489
00:27:30,472 --> 00:27:33,993
Your medic is worried that
he's resistant to memory inhibitor.

490
00:27:34,017 --> 00:27:35,217
He's an alcoholic.

491
00:27:35,394 --> 00:27:37,187
I gave him a stronger
dose to compensate,

492
00:27:37,212 --> 00:27:40,250
but his tolerance may be high.

493
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:43,878
Well, whatever, we gotta
release him anyway. Protocol 3.

494
00:27:43,902 --> 00:27:46,130
He, uh, he doesn't wanna talk to you.

495
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:47,204
Fine by me.

496
00:27:47,823 --> 00:27:50,423
- He does wanna speak with you.
- Huh.

497
00:27:52,494 --> 00:27:54,260
Also, I'm, uh, I'm down a couple of

498
00:27:54,285 --> 00:27:55,682
Traveler agents driving
your people home.

499
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:57,809
Can you spare anyone to keep an eye
on the back of the property?

500
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,107
We can spare me.

501
00:27:59,365 --> 00:28:01,232
Yeah, you can spare me, too.

502
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:06,349
Mm.

503
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:08,542
Agent 443.

504
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,330
Keep your comms open.

505
00:28:22,691 --> 00:28:25,833
Jeff, I am so sorry
you got caught up in this.

506
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:27,680
I'd been investigating Vincent Ingram

507
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,090
for some time, and unfortunately...

508
00:28:29,114 --> 00:28:31,647
Yeah, yeah, they told me all about it.

509
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:33,720
It all went down
because I'm close to Carly

510
00:28:33,744 --> 00:28:35,410
and Carly's close to you.

511
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:38,672
So how close?

512
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,166
Okay. You want the truth?

513
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:46,316
Ms. Shannon has been working for me.

514
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,540
- The FBI?
- Yes.

515
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,111
Carly Shannon, FBI.

516
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:53,668
- For several months.
- I don't think so.

517
00:28:54,306 --> 00:28:57,839
'Cause she... she don't got it in her.
Not my Carly.

518
00:28:59,061 --> 00:29:01,194
But then again, my Carly's gone.

519
00:29:01,897 --> 00:29:04,542
Because this girl,
this girl's not Carly.

520
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:06,628
This girl's a completely
different person.

521
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:08,785
And I don't know what you did...

522
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,591
but I don't like her much no more.

523
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:13,441
Judging by the condition of your face,

524
00:29:13,466 --> 00:29:14,761
she doesn't like you much either.

525
00:29:14,785 --> 00:29:16,318
That is funny.

526
00:29:16,787 --> 00:29:19,053
Well, least we can laugh about it.

527
00:29:20,582 --> 00:29:23,519
No, I don't want anything to do
with this girl, you can have her.

528
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:25,146
You sure?
'Cause I think she missed a spot.

529
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:28,636
- Keep it up.
- You're the one that wanted to talk.

530
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:30,841
I wanted you to know

531
00:29:30,884 --> 00:29:35,350
that I remember things that
I didn't tell your boy upstairs about.

532
00:29:35,597 --> 00:29:38,330
It's not all there yet.
Not all at once.

533
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,662
Just itty bitty pieces percolating

534
00:29:40,686 --> 00:29:43,039
like the morning after
a night you been drinking.

535
00:29:43,063 --> 00:29:45,208
Well, you'd know more about that
than I would.

536
00:29:45,232 --> 00:29:46,765
But it'll come to me...

537
00:29:48,235 --> 00:29:49,285
it will.

538
00:29:59,204 --> 00:30:01,350
And the only thing that you need to

539
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:02,684
make it happen from there

540
00:30:02,708 --> 00:30:06,508
is sunlight and water.
Food just rises up from the soil.

541
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:10,595
It's beautiful when you think about it,
you know. How...

542
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,570
Nothing out here.

543
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:16,060
Yeah, let's head back.

544
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:33,840
- We're being surveilled.
- By who?

545
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:37,530
Can't say who or how many,
but we saw some footprints.

546
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:39,459
Footprints, that's it?

547
00:30:39,953 --> 00:30:42,640
We need to get proper reinforcements
and take them out.

548
00:30:42,664 --> 00:30:46,264
Take them out?
What if it's nosy next door neighbors?

549
00:30:47,093 --> 00:30:49,973
Wakefield's got a small
army protecting us, Carly.

550
00:30:50,604 --> 00:30:52,163
Dial it back a little.

551
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,840
One of the secondaries just

552
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:28,406
passed through the checkpoint.

553
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,771
It's the cop.

554
00:31:29,795 --> 00:31:32,523
We'll get the driver
at the same time we get their historian.

555
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:34,484
That's lockdown. Nobody else in or out.

556
00:31:40,972 --> 00:31:43,172
This water is incredible.

557
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:46,084
Not recycled 10,000 times.

558
00:31:47,687 --> 00:31:48,737
Well, I'm done.

559
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,400
The Director's code should allow

560
00:31:51,425 --> 00:31:53,544
traveler teams to identify every copy

561
00:31:53,568 --> 00:31:57,034
of your ill-conceived confessions
that's out there.

562
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:58,132
Thanks.

563
00:31:58,156 --> 00:32:00,802
Although, the effort
hardly seems worth it.

564
00:32:00,826 --> 00:32:04,292
No one from the 21st
would actually believe that...

565
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:07,088
What's wrong?

566
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:10,700
I, uh, thought that I saw...

567
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:17,151
Maybe I'm exhausted.
Was your transition here tiring?

568
00:32:17,175 --> 00:32:20,575
Well, I was going through
heroin withdrawal, so...

569
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:23,616
How could you leave me behind like this?

570
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,306
I was assigned a mission.

571
00:32:26,518 --> 00:32:27,568
You ran away.

572
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:30,206
- No.
- Because things are getting worse here.

573
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,763
I'm trying to save you!

574
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:36,918
It's already too late for me.

575
00:32:38,238 --> 00:32:39,288
Simon?

576
00:32:42,158 --> 00:32:43,758
What are you looking at?

577
00:32:43,994 --> 00:32:46,013
My friend's not really there, is he?

578
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:47,103
No. We're alone.

579
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,926
Why would the Director do this to me?

580
00:32:58,008 --> 00:33:00,074
It makes mistakes just like us.

581
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,940
Come on, you gotta try the food.

582
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:18,796
Carly and Trevor think
we're being surveilled.

583
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,257
- Faction?
- Wouldn't be the first time.

584
00:33:21,281 --> 00:33:23,050
We've got plenty of cameras
set up outside.

585
00:33:23,074 --> 00:33:24,677
The Director will take 'em out
if they get close.

586
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:28,681
- I can get Philip on some back up if...
- Mac, I got it covered.

587
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:30,975
Hell, I'll bring in air assets
if I have to.

588
00:33:30,999 --> 00:33:32,852
Well, now you're just showing off.

589
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:34,186
They're upstairs waiting for you.

590
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,143
Kat's in the room
at the top of the stairs.

591
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:42,768
Hey.

592
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,136
I wanted to see you sooner, but
Wakefield insisted on debriefing you.

593
00:33:49,225 --> 00:33:51,491
I've felt like this before, Grant.

594
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,253
- Like what?
- That I've lost something.

595
00:33:55,565 --> 00:33:56,615
Time.

596
00:33:57,817 --> 00:34:00,750
I woke up once months ago
feeling this way.

597
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:04,842
My head was pounding like it is now

598
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:08,554
and I couldn't remember anything
that happened the day before.

599
00:34:08,578 --> 00:34:12,251
Remember the day your SUV was stolen?

600
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:14,421
You said I had too much to drink.

601
00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:18,076
Well, you went at it pretty hard, Kat.
What do you want to me to say?

602
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,504
That you drugged me.
To make me forget something.

603
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:26,155
What are you trying to make me forget?

604
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,979
Jesus, Kat, why would I...?

605
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:30,983
Shit.

606
00:34:33,353 --> 00:34:35,419
Guess I just have to try again.

607
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:40,586
No!

608
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,660
Hey.

609
00:34:43,363 --> 00:34:44,413
- Hi.
- Hi.

610
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,883
They said I could,
I could talk to you now.

611
00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:54,203
It's about time.
I've been asking for you all morning.

612
00:34:59,421 --> 00:35:02,149
I'm sorry. I'm going too fast.

613
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:04,506
No, it's okay. It's me, I'm just...

614
00:35:10,765 --> 00:35:11,815
Come here.

615
00:35:27,198 --> 00:35:28,248
Kat...

616
00:35:30,452 --> 00:35:33,318
everything is gonna be
like it was before.

617
00:35:33,705 --> 00:35:34,755
I promise you.

618
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:46,533
I'm so sorry.

619
00:35:47,594 --> 00:35:49,260
Let me see. Does it hurt?

620
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:52,833
This? Nah, you should see the other guy.

621
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:53,951
What other guy?

622
00:35:53,975 --> 00:35:55,661
I have no idea,
I'm just assuming there was one.

623
00:35:55,685 --> 00:35:57,246
Hey! Let's get out of here.

624
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:59,415
I'm craving sesame chicken
for some reason.

625
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:01,917
Okay, we can't just pretend
like this didn't happen.

626
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:04,253
You deal with this sort of thing
every day.

627
00:36:04,277 --> 00:36:05,421
What's a minor kidnapping?

628
00:36:05,445 --> 00:36:07,256
There's nothing minor about this.

629
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,924
I was on the other end of the phone

630
00:36:08,948 --> 00:36:10,408
while you were giving CPR to somebody

631
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:11,927
after some explosion, for God's sakes!

632
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:13,916
I refuse to make this
a bigger deal than it is.

633
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:15,043
Okay, David.

634
00:36:15,076 --> 00:36:16,766
You were held by a mass serial killer

635
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,185
who thought time travelers
were out to get him.

636
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:22,063
I know. Isn't that the stupidest thing
you've ever heard?

637
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:23,287
Uh-huh.

638
00:36:35,475 --> 00:36:36,525
Go.

639
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:39,080
One of our assault teams was forced
to move early on a Serbian cell.

640
00:36:39,104 --> 00:36:40,915
They were about to lose containment.

641
00:36:40,939 --> 00:36:41,989
Casualties?

642
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:45,127
All five members of the Traveler team
confirmed dead.

643
00:36:45,151 --> 00:36:47,417
Sir. You can't go ahead with this.

644
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:51,655
You have about 90 seconds
to change my mind.

645
00:37:05,713 --> 00:37:07,979
Shit.

646
00:37:09,968 --> 00:37:12,101
Tell Wakefield and get a weapon.

647
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:19,203
Mac, Wakefield's team
just bugged out of here

648
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:23,093
and there are soldiers taking up
positions all around us.

649
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:27,715
I know you need me
and I'll be there for you.

650
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:31,079
God damn you.

651
00:37:36,161 --> 00:37:37,972
- I'll say it again,
- We've got company.

652
00:37:37,996 --> 00:37:40,262
I'm Senior Special Agent Wakefield

653
00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:43,602
and I need armed air assets
to these coordinates now.

654
00:37:43,626 --> 00:37:44,854
They're not faction.

655
00:37:44,878 --> 00:37:46,605
- I've got 20 armed men out there.
- No, you don't.

656
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:48,562
Most of 'em are already gone.

657
00:37:49,174 --> 00:37:50,640
Then they're on to us.

658
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,146
Here.

659
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:05,583
Mac, we are outmanned and
out-gunned! Get your ass out here!

660
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:07,918
Kat, I'm sorry. I gotta go back outside.

661
00:38:07,942 --> 00:38:10,475
- Wait... What?
- I'll be right back.

662
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:15,134
Okay, I need you to stay here
and stay away from the window.

663
00:38:15,158 --> 00:38:17,291
The window? Okay, get behind me.

664
00:38:19,412 --> 00:38:20,545
How do we know...

665
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:25,039
The last time the Director spoke to me,

666
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:28,314
it was not through an
AI in Teslia's lab.

667
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:30,004
You received a messenger.

668
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:32,173
But it wasn't a child.

669
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:35,571
I was just told my mother
was essentially brain dead,

670
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:37,395
but it was gonna take time.

671
00:38:38,932 --> 00:38:40,532
I wanted to be with her.

672
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:43,133
Last night, she spoke to me.

673
00:38:43,603 --> 00:38:45,269
Listen to me carefully...

674
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:51,415
Tell him the bargain he made
that autumn morning

675
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,796
was not with his God, but with me.

676
00:39:09,545 --> 00:39:10,595
Mom.

677
00:39:14,175 --> 00:39:15,975
Those were her exact words.

678
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:20,029
She died in that moment.

679
00:39:20,306 --> 00:39:23,372
It's not something
I'm ever likely to forget.

680
00:39:29,941 --> 00:39:30,991
Sir?

681
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,160
This is the day.

682
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:43,722
- Get down.
- How many?

683
00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:46,141
More than we can fight.
Where's Wakefield?

684
00:39:46,165 --> 00:39:47,726
He's inside trying to
get Traveler backup.

685
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,812
Maybe we should go back inside
the house, where there's cover...

686
00:39:49,836 --> 00:39:51,438
We're not getting into a fire fight.

687
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:52,690
It won't be up to us.

688
00:39:52,714 --> 00:39:54,316
The Director hasn't waived Protocol 3.

689
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,390
Fuck that.

690
00:40:06,978 --> 00:40:08,578
They're on our six, too.

691
00:40:12,483 --> 00:40:14,683
Sir, we're waiting on your order.

692
00:40:34,172 --> 00:40:35,222
Sir.

693
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:44,356
Sir?

694
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:48,078
All units stand down.
Operation's canceled.

695
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:49,635
No go. I repeat, no go.

696
00:40:49,854 --> 00:40:54,251
All units stand down and pull back
by order of Director Stevenson.

697
00:41:06,412 --> 00:41:07,478
They're leaving.

698
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:09,297
What?

699
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,510
She's right.

700
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,046
Everybody out of here! Move!

701
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,610
Okay, lady.

702
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:33,112
Come on. You're free to go.

703
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:34,865
Go where?

704
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:36,335
I could care less.

705
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:52,173
Are you fucking kidding me?

706
00:42:18,317 --> 00:42:21,783
That autumn morning,
I was also in a hospital room.

707
00:42:22,655 --> 00:42:26,455
My daughter Claire
was dying from a rare form of cancer.

708
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:30,043
There was very little time left.

709
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:33,172
She spoke to you.

710
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,990
I will save her life,

711
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:46,610
but there will come a day of reckoning.

712
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:51,660
I never told a soul.

713
00:42:51,684 --> 00:42:54,217
She began to improve the next morning.

714
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:56,988
I thought it was a miracle.

715
00:43:01,694 --> 00:43:02,744
Daddy!

716
00:43:13,247 --> 00:43:14,380
It was a miracle.

717
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,074
The Director cured her.

718
00:43:18,586 --> 00:43:21,786
I've read reports
of their advanced technology.

719
00:43:24,175 --> 00:43:25,775
Keeps me awake at night.

720
00:43:29,222 --> 00:43:31,241
I wonder what made them stand down.

721
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:33,660
I have to believe the Director
had something to do with...

722
00:43:33,684 --> 00:43:35,150
So... what's going on?

723
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:38,928
David, I told you to stay in the room.

724
00:43:39,649 --> 00:43:41,315
Yeah, but then we didn't.

725
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:47,652
A jumpy junior agent got over-excited.
Honestly, it was nothing.

726
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:51,759
Why don't I believe you?

727
00:43:54,872 --> 00:43:57,072
You made the right decision, sir.

728
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:00,760
We'll see.

729
00:44:02,171 --> 00:44:03,221
So...

730
00:44:05,216 --> 00:44:06,846
What do we do now?

731
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:15,109
