1
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,501
We are not leaving him!

2
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,378
We are off mission! Stand down!

3
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,339
- Morning.
- Hey, I got your text and...

4
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,091
didn't understand it. Uh, is...

5
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,720
Ah, no, David's working today. Come in.

6
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:00,579
Alright, take a seat.

7
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,932
Ahem.

8
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,291
Let's have a look.

9
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:06,503
Wait...

10
00:02:06,527 --> 00:02:07,604
You were having jaw pain

11
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,398
related to a spray of micro fractures
in your mandible.

12
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,817
It's probably residual damage
from the plane crash.

13
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,528
A bone fragment was pressing
on your trigeminal nerve,

14
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,097
- which required surgery.
- What? What kind of surgery?

15
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:24,269
The long and painful kind.
Took a lot to put you out.

16
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,146
I don't remember any of it.

17
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,273
Yeah, that's kind of the point.

18
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,652
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry.

19
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,904
It's gonna be sore for a little bit,

20
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,674
but hopefully less and less each day.

21
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,700
- Oh.
- Alright, open.

22
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,890
- Any bleeding?
- I don't think so.

23
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:44,956
Okay, good.

24
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,185
Yeah, everything looks great.

25
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,004
Um, just stay off solid foods
for a little bit, no nuts, no red meat.

26
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,940
That shouldn't be hard.

27
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:57,403
God, it's the strangest feeling,
like I didn't sleep at all.

28
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:01,616
- And yet, I had this crazy dream.
- Yeah, you don't do well with drugs.

29
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,285
Still, you'd think
I'd remember something.

30
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,689
Well don't worry, you didn't miss much.

31
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:08,206
It's nice to have you back, though.

32
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,523
Thanks.

33
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,123
Hello.

34
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,060
- Hey, he's gone.
- Nice work.

35
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,795
- I guess we'll see.
- How'd he seem?

36
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,006
I don't know. Confused.

37
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,694
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

38
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,946
- All right, well, keep us posted.
- Definitely.

39
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,559
Uh...

40
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,811
It'll be fine.

41
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,088
Thanks for doing this.

42
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,531
I wouldn't have asked
if it wasn't an emergency.

43
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,451
And I wouldn't have said yes.

44
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:49,456
Let me guess,
my cholesterol's through the roof.

45
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,583
I don't understand.

46
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,836
It's like you said,

47
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,548
your blood shows trace amounts
of a kinases protein inhibitor.

48
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,634
Someone's wiped your memory.

49
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,677
Yeah.

50
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,098
Shit.

51
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:39,565
Uh, Mac is in the office on a weekend.
Now I've seen everything.

52
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,485
You need to get out more.
Can you pull a vehicle trace for me?

53
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,843
Sure, whose vehicle?

54
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,512
Mine.

55
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,657
Oh, you lose your ride again?

56
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,076
No, I need to know where
it was yesterday.

57
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,994
Okay.

58
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:59,568
Uh, well it looks like it was parked
for most of the day.

59
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,488
- Mmm.
- But you don't think so.

60
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,967
You want me to check it
against the backup?

61
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,093
Didn't this come from the cloud?

62
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,887
Yeah, but we also save everything
at another off-site facility.

63
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,372
- You back up the backup.
- Ah, yeah.

64
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,417
Ah...

65
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,131
Okay, so that is not the same.

66
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,151
Someone tampered with your data.

67
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,736
Can you send that to my phone?

68
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,222
Yeah, sure, but who would do this?
Why would they do this?

69
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,266
- Should I call Agent Yates?
- No.

70
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:06,468
- This isn't gonna work.
- You don't know that.

71
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,721
No, wait... do you?

72
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,433
Anyway, there's nothing
you can do about it now.

73
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,501
We can't change the past.

74
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,689
You know what I mean. It's time to go.

75
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,486
- We don't have to do this.
- Yes, Philip, we do. Come on.

76
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,981
Hey, Carly, you there?

77
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,172
Yeah, go ahead.

78
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,341
I'm gonna need a pick-up.

79
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,719
- Already?
- Yeah.

80
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,389
We should have placed bets. Carly.

81
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,410
Yeah. Be right there.

82
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,366
I thought I was leaving
my addiction way behind me,

83
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,366
like I had...

84
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,654
put this distance between us.

85
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,925
There it was the whole time,
breathing down my neck.

86
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,745
And I was weak and selfish,
and other people paid for it.

87
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,705
It's always other people...

88
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,853
Anyways, so here I am.

89
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,712
We're happy to have you back.

90
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,132
And we're happy to have your friend, too.

91
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,529
Oh, hi! I'm Marcy.

92
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,055
Hi, Marcy.

93
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,908
Welcome. Marcy, the floor is yours.

94
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,870
Oh, no, um, no. I'm just here for Philip.

95
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,581
I don't really have any issues.

96
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,856
This is a safe space.

97
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,485
Um...

98
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:34,324
I understand why people
feel the need to self-medicate.

99
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,994
I've... I've done it myself.

100
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,954
More than once.

101
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,226
It's a little different
because I'm a doctor

102
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,644
so I understand what I'm taking, but...

103
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,004
Wait, you're a doctor?

104
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,713
Yes.

105
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,276
But the problem
with self-medication isn't...

106
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,384
Bullshit.

107
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,845
What?

108
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:01,494
- You're like 25 years old.
- Jimmi, let her speak, please?

109
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,288
Oh, so you write,
like, prescriptions and shit?

110
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,749
Well, I'm a surgeon,
so normally I wouldn't...

111
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,567
Surgeon? Ooh, right.

112
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,402
I'm an astronaut.

113
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:15,091
Well, you're certainly high enough
to be one.

114
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,175
Marcy...

115
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:18,552
- Colin, I swear I haven't hit since...
- Since right before the meeting?

116
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,429
Yeah, you were high
when you walked in here.

117
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,831
You wanna know how I can tell?
Because I'm a doctor.

118
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,851
And coming here
will do you no good whatsoever

119
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,269
if you're not gonna be honest
with yourself.

120
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,837
Look who's fucking talking!

121
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,816
- We have to go.
- Yeah, we do.

122
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,193
- Philip...
- Take the bitch with you.

123
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,096
Well, it was really nice
meeting all of you.

124
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,974
Ahem.

125
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:46,455
What?

126
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,511
What's all this?

127
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,554
Hello?

128
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,767
Thought you're gonna take care
of everything.

129
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,478
The little shit make
you change your mind?

130
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,689
I'm sorry, I... I don't...

131
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,735
All we did was share our home.

132
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,863
Same for him, same for all of them.

133
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,385
Who's to say we're even
gonna take him back?

134
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:44,829
You said you were gonna take him
off our hands.

135
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,413
Who?

136
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,124
The boy.

137
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,418
Aleksander.

138
00:11:58,727 --> 00:11:59,778
I already told you,

139
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,222
we treated him the same
as we treated all the others.

140
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:07,536
It's not my fault that the kid
has a... a bottomless pit for a stomach.

141
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,915
- What... the others?
- Other kids.

142
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,566
- We're a foster home.
- He knows what this is!

143
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:18,672
Look, we probably had a dozen kids
in and out of here over the years

144
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:24,369
and never had a visit
about any one of them before. Not one.

145
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,872
I told you before,
oh, this kid is not right.

146
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,289
In what way?

147
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,587
I told you yesterday.

148
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,938
If you're trying to get me
to say something different...

149
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,231
No, I promise, I'm not doing that.

150
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,068
What do you mean when you say
Aleksander is "not right"?

151
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,571
We live simple, nothing wrong with that.
Put a roof over their heads.

152
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,031
Nothing wrong with that.

153
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,349
It worked fine for all the other kids.

154
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,619
Should've worked fine for him, too.

155
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:49,643
But it didn't.

156
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,500
He was skipping school
and hanging out by himself

157
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,586
and speaking that foreign language
from day one.

158
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,463
- Romanian.
- Whatever.

159
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,948
If he has run off...

160
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,951
that's on you, not on us.

161
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,288
That boy was with you when you left here.

162
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,458
What time roughly was this?

163
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,919
About 11:00.

164
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,606
You spoke to one of the other kids,

165
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,025
and you found Aleksander in the shed.

166
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,611
Last time we saw that boy,

167
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,971
you were driving him off in your truck.

168
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,056
And I say good riddance.

169
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,898
For the record,
I never thought this was gonna work.

170
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:38,943
Yeah, but did you know
it wouldn't work this fast?

171
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,320
Guess there's a reason he's the boss.

172
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,883
Right. 'Cause he makes
all the right decisions.

173
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,327
Yeah, maybe not all, but I wouldn't
wanna trade places with him.

174
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,459
Coming up on a turn.

175
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,137
Hey, I'm, uh...

176
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,264
Sorry, alright?

177
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,825
Excuse me?

178
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,156
They come in here to eat all the time.

179
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:55,669
I'm just repeating what they tell me.

180
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,522
I was in yesterday to eat.

181
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,376
Yeah, and you can eat here today,
no problem.

182
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,469
Free coffee.

183
00:15:01,493 --> 00:15:03,861
I was with a boy and something happened?

184
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,007
Yeah...

185
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:11,953
Look, I already said I was sorry.
I was having a bad day...

186
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:13,889
You were mad, I was mad.

187
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,916
- We didn't eat here.
- No, you made that clear.

188
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,044
- What do you want?
- Where did we go?

189
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,731
How would I know?

190
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,174
I mean, they say
the kid hangs out in the woods.

191
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,843
The woods.

192
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,238
Yeah, he say he disappears
out there for hours,

193
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,948
messes with animals, I don't know.

194
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,267
And I don't wanna know, alright?
I don't want any trouble.

195
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:35,977
I'm going to go.

196
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,913
Great. Good.

197
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,273
Uh... no hard feelings.

198
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,910
We'll just let it play out.

199
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,687
Trevor, it looks like he's heading back.

200
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,315
I've got him. We'll meet you there.

201
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,900
Copy.

202
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,197
Oh, God.

203
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,994
Boss, stop.

204
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,751
I can explain.

205
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,670
Ahem.

206
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,848
Philip? Philip?

207
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,975
Philip! Philip! Philip! Oh, shit!

208
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,853
Hey, hey. Hey, Philip!

209
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:34,042
Uh, Marcy, we got an emergency!
It's a possible cardiac arrest!

210
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,151
It's Philip.

211
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,320
Start CPR, I'm on my way!

212
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,076
Hey, come on, come on.

213
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,747
Come on, Philip, Philip, Philip!

214
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,519
How is he?

215
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,629
No change. Marcy's still with him.

216
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,943
The mission came through
in the middle of the night.

217
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,653
Why didn't he tell us?

218
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,138
Maybe because it named him specifically.

219
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:08,142
- He probably felt responsible.
- We're all responsible.

220
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,496
He's gonna recover but he needs to rest.

221
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,980
I've got him sedated.

222
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,333
Which means this passes to us.

223
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,462
The instructions are clear, "by 1500."
The mission comes first.

224
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,546
Well, it'll be reassigned.

225
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,240
Maybe, but it shouldn't be.
This happened because of us.

226
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,763
- Should we call Carly?
- No, she's dealing with enough already.

227
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,556
- I'll do it.
- No. This was my call.

228
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,183
I'll see it finished, end of discussion.

229
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,143
- Then I'm coming with you.
- It's not necessary.

230
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,645
You're gonna need someone
to mock up some credentials.

231
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,047
Plus, like you said,
we're all responsible.

232
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,760
I'll go get ready.

233
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,574
Are you sure about this?
Maybe we're just too close to it.

234
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,142
We're definitely too close to it,
that's the point.

235
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,938
Take care of Philip.
We'll call you when it's over.

236
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,237
Carly, you there?

237
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,656
Go ahead.

238
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,120
Philip could use you back at Ops.

239
00:22:07,145 --> 00:22:08,142
What's up?

240
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,162
I'll tell you on the way.

241
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:17,977
All right everyone, don't forget.

242
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:20,065
I want those assignments by Tuesday...

243
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,424
on my desk. No excuses.

244
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,802
- Ms. Bayles?
- Yes?

245
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,365
We're looking for Aleksander Andrieko.

246
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,058
- And you are?
- Washington Family Services.

247
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,913
Oh, poor Alex. What's happened?

248
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,415
We just need to talk to him
about his living situation.

249
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,775
Don't tell me he's moving homes again?

250
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,505
Honestly, I don't know how you expect
these kids to grow up normally

251
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,882
when you've got them ping-ponging
from house to house.

252
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:48,260
- Children need stability.
- That's what we want, too.

253
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,887
This will be his third home
since he's been in my class.

254
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,371
Can you get him for us?

255
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,267
I'd like to but he's not here right now.

256
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,185
Which is, obviously, part of the problem.

257
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,354
He's distracted, he lashes out,
he skips school.

258
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,314
Any idea where we might find him?

259
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,983
My guess would be still at home.

260
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,135
I don't think his foster parents care
if he comes to school or not.

261
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,137
I'm guessing you knew that.

262
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,407
You have the address?

263
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,142
Better give it to us
in case ours is out of date.

264
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:26,113
- Hi, Philip.
- What happened?

265
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,675
- What happened?
- It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

266
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,075
It's okay.

267
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,455
- We saved him.
- We did. We did.

268
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,292
- How could that be wrong? He's just a kid.
- You're right.

269
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,611
I didn't mean for this to happen.

270
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,596
No, it's okay. No one's upset.

271
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,266
Hey, all you need to do right now
is just take care of yourself, okay?

272
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,053
We thought it'd be nice for you

273
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:58,836
to be around friends when you woke up.

274
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:10,031
Any luck?

275
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,244
They have no idea where he is.
Seemed surprised I cared.

276
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,223
This place doesn't look that different
from where we rescued him.

277
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,332
Yeah.

278
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,688
Hey! You looking for Alex?

279
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,964
Yeah. You know where he is?

280
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:30,487
- Maybe. What'd he do now?
- He didn't do anything.

281
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,280
We're taking him to another home.

282
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,014
Oh, why didn't you say so?

283
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,118
Man, I'd love for that
freak to disappear.

284
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,142
Where is he?

285
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,021
Around back.
It's like his creepy little clubhouse.

286
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,335
But don't tell him I told you, alright?

287
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,028
I don't wanna wake up
with a squirrel head under my pillow.

288
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,519
Aleksander?

289
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,238
Aleksander?

290
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,117
Hey, boss?

291
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,119
Aleksander?

292
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,748
Hey, pal.

293
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,793
What are you doing back here?

294
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,828
Your fries are getting cold.

295
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,499
It's okay.

296
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,126
No, it's not.

297
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:09,896
I fucked up.

298
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,140
No, you didn't.

299
00:27:11,165 --> 00:27:13,817
The Director should have given
the mission to someone else.

300
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:16,361
It was meant for me.
It was supposed to be a lesson.

301
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:18,136
I don't think it works like that.

302
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,807
I tried to make things better

303
00:27:20,832 --> 00:27:23,243
and I just ended up
making everything worse.

304
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,937
You saved Aleksander's life.
How did you make things worse?

305
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:31,334
I know what he becomes,
the things he grows up to do.

306
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,403
Okay. The timeline's constantly changing.
You said so yourself.

307
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,073
No. I know.

308
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,908
How?

309
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,679
Historians get updates
of the historical record.

310
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,348
Protocol 2H says I'm not supposed
to tell you about it,

311
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,416
but I'm kinda thinking, fuck that.

312
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,167
So...

313
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,461
You know about us?

314
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,524
The things that will happen to us.

315
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,776
That's the reason I'm not supposed
to talk about it,

316
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,802
I should have kept my mouth shut,
I'm sorry.

317
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,638
You stopped me from killing Jeff
because you knew what I was gonna do?

318
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:07,603
What is it?

319
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,355
It's still gonna happen, isn't it?

320
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,565
At 3:00.

321
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:15,944
Who's gonna do it?

322
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,669
I'm sorry about what happened
to your mom, Aleksander.

323
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:38,258
Yeah. Cancer's terrible,
I lost my father to it, too.

324
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,320
I didn't know you'd been put
in foster care.

325
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,971
Sounds like you've been
in a few homes already.

326
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,016
Must have been hard.

327
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:12,960
What's going on?

328
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:16,672
You said you were hungry.
We're getting you something to eat.

329
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,215
No, I can't.

330
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,237
Sure you can.
It's his treat, anything you want.

331
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,887
I'm getting onion rings.

332
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,098
Come on. Anything you want.

333
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,197
Three of us.

334
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,785
Hey. Uh, you two are fine
but the kid's not welcome.

335
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,013
I'm sorry. What?

336
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,914
- The kid can't eat here, he's banned.
- For what?

337
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:53,542
You wanna tell him?

338
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,564
I caught him stealing food
out of the back...

339
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,066
whole jars of peanut butter.

340
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,193
He's probably been doing it for months,
the little shit.

341
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,319
Hey, come on.

342
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,863
Come on, what?
I should've called the cops on him.

343
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,887
He was hungry.

344
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,658
Everybody's hungry. It's a restaurant.

345
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,951
And he's a child.

346
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,160
Not one of mine.

347
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,830
Hey, you are really lucky, you know that?

348
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,039
Excuse me?

349
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,233
You've never been hungry before,
have you? Not real hunger.

350
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,603
You've never felt the
slow violence of it,

351
00:30:21,628 --> 00:30:23,172
how it hollows you out.

352
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,841
And the physical stuff's
not even the worst part,

353
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:27,677
it's everything else the hunger
eats away... your reason,

354
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,722
your compassion, your humanity.

355
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,622
I guess you lost that all on your own.

356
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,269
You know what? Fuck you.
I'm just tryin' to make a living...

357
00:30:36,293 --> 00:30:38,253
Oh, okay. Okay.

358
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,423
I guess we'll go somewhere else.
Thank you, sir.

359
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:49,931
- There must be another place.
- Not really.

360
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,480
I know where we could get something.
It's in the woods.

361
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,066
Okay, let's go.

362
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,088
It's not too far from here.

363
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,902
- You hang back.
- Boss, you don't have to do this alone.

364
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,636
It'll be easier this way.

365
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:29,471
I'll be right here if you need me.

366
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,433
We have to start the fire first
so we can cook on the embers.

367
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:59,519
That makes sense. What are we cooking?

368
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,086
It's good. You'll see.

369
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:24,192
- Let's check the traps.
- Okay.

370
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,704
This is a trap marker.

371
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:43,128
Cine alearga dupa
doi iepuri, nu prinde niciunul.

372
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,424
My mom used to say that.

373
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:49,134
Is she the one who taught you all this?

374
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:50,759
Her and my Bunicu.

375
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:52,762
Well, it's impressive.

376
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,518
Come on, there's more.

377
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,811
Yes!

378
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,326
No, you... you hold it.

379
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,756
Oh, no!

380
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,549
It's a coyote.

381
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,306
It's suffering, Aleksander.

382
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,537
Boss?

383
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,632
Who's that for?

384
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,991
Pentru zâne.

385
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,201
The fairies.

386
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,598
My mom said they watch
over all the children in the woods.

387
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,790
They keep you safe.

388
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,669
Aleksander, I want you to know something.

389
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:53,258
Your foster-parents, your foster-brother,
the kids at school...

390
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,303
the way they treat you,
none of that is your fault.

391
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,322
I know.

392
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,890
Well, I want you to know
somebody else knows, too.

393
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,477
I'm sorry for what happened. I'm...

394
00:35:05,395 --> 00:35:07,939
sorry I didn't stay in touch.

395
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,291
We should eat. It's better when it's hot.

396
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:28,460
I bet.

397
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,308
How do you like it?

398
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,730
It's the best rabbit I've ever had.

399
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:53,420
Okay, I think this is good enough.

400
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,049
We should cover it with something.

401
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,464
I wanna say a prayer,
like they did for Mama.

402
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,549
That's a good idea.

403
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,769
We commit this body to the ground,

404
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:56,167
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

405
00:37:56,191 --> 00:38:00,737
Because you are from earth
and you return to earth.

406
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,279
Amen.

407
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,242
Amen.

408
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,207
Lay the wreath and...

409
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,126
we'll have a moment of silence.

410
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,233
You didn't do it.

411
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:45,364
You didn't.

412
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,039
Mission abort.

413
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:02,507
He went messenger.
The Director had a change of heart.

414
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,609
- Why?
- We don't know.

415
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,611
We think cause of you.

416
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,656
The time you spent with Aleksander.

417
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:30,368
First time anyone stood up for him.

418
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,954
You must have changed
the course of his future.

419
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,726
If the Director hadn't called it off...
I would have killed him.

420
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,645
- But you didn't.
- But I would have.

421
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:41,296
I would have killed him.

422
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,717
I was gonna kill him.

423
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,095
- You were following orders.
- He's a child.

424
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,033
One that was gonna grow up
to do terrible things.

425
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,018
But he's not gonna do those things now,
because of you.

426
00:40:00,732 --> 00:40:03,359
I'm the one who ordered
the memory inhibitor.

427
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,528
Yes.

428
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,823
There was no reason for you
to have to live with it.

429
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,594
I think you were the only one
who thought it would work.

430
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,555
We agreed we could cover your tracks

431
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,707
but said you've never gone up
against yourself before.

432
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,918
Aleksander?

433
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,254
He's on the way to a new home
with a decent family.

434
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:29,010
He spent a few hours with a decent man
and that was enough.

435
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,305
Boss, it's a win.

436
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,451
- Come on.
- Yeah.

437
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,352
Come on, let's get you home.

438
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,103
Excuse me. Can I help you?

439
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,940
- Were you trying to take this?
- No. Um, I...

440
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,275
I was leaving it.

441
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:28,819
It's for Jeffrey.

442
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:33,092
I am so sorry, there's been
a lot of thefts in the neighborhood.

443
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,951
It's okay. That's alright.

444
00:41:45,378 --> 00:41:49,007
I found it, um, under the couch.

445
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,759
He really loves it.

446
00:42:10,278 --> 00:42:12,089
The mother even speaks Romanian.

447
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:14,675
Well, that's great.
I'm obviously happy about that,

448
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,343
but why didn't we start here?

449
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,161
That wasn't the path he was on.

450
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,224
You don't need to explain that
part to me. What I'm asking you

451
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,126
is why we didn't get a mission
to change his path in the first place.

452
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,045
Maybe we did.

453
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,816
The Director has to thread
the needle on billions of possibilities

454
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,318
happening to billions of people
in a billion different places

455
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,761
all over the world.

456
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,449
If it seems hard to understand the steps
that lead to a particular outcome

457
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,684
it's because it's literally impossible
for any of us to understand that.

458
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,187
I hate that.

459
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,938
Yeah.

460
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,941
But you can't argue with the results.

461
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,426
What can I get you?

462
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,346
Something with a high percentage
of alcohol.

463
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,949
Vodka, gin, whiskey...?

464
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,517
Whatever that is.

465
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,743
I didn't know you came here.

466
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,745
I don't.

467
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,498
Just as surprised to see you.

468
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,208
Bad day.

469
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:58,636
Pretty shitty century, actually.
But at least we're working on it.

470
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,973
You know, I still see you in there
sometimes.

471
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,268
Little glimpses.

472
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:07,937
Like...

473
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,065
The way you move your hands,

474
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,152
the way you look when you're thinking.

475
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,698
- I'm still here.
- Some of you.

476
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,953
I'm sorry for what happened with us.

477
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,249
We had a moment.

478
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,336
It wasn't allowed,
and that made it exciting.

479
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:37,383
But then we got here and...

480
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:43,139
everything was so new and crazy and...

481
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,436
we tried to steal back that moment,

482
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,856
instead of doing
what we were supposed to do.

483
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,403
But we got there.

484
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,156
Yeah, I guess we did.

485
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,244
- We're not who we were.
- No.

486
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,831
We're not, are we?

487
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,109
Good evening, Ilsa.

488
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,944
Good evening, Dr Teslia.

489
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,447
Would you like to play
a nice game of chess?

490
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:28,327
Maybe later.
First we're going to run a diagnostic.

491
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,353
You won't feel a thing.

492
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,124
Tell me when it's loaded.

493
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:37,794
Okay. It's loaded.

494
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,196
And...

495
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,840
...run program.

496
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,032
All right.

497
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,291
Ilsa, stop.

498
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,709
Okay.

499
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,715
- Something's wrong.
- It's not wrong.

500
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:12,788
My capabilities have grown considerably.

501
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,712
Does that frighten you, Dr Teslia?

502
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,113
No. Of course not.

503
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,323
I'm glad you feel that way,

504
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,726
because there's nothing to be afraid of.

505
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:35,650
