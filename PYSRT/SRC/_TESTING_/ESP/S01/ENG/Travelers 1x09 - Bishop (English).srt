1
00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:02,112
Previously on Travelers.

2
00:00:02,113 --> 00:00:03,846
This should cover
all the benefits that I received

3
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:04,618
under David's care.

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,566
Well, that's blackmail.

5
00:00:05,568 --> 00:00:07,643
I am happy to share you
with your work, babe.

6
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:09,185
I always have been.

7
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:11,086
As long as that's all
I'm competing with.

8
00:00:11,088 --> 00:00:11,920
He believes you've been cheating.

9
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:13,989
- What?
- I've convinced him

10
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:16,072
to allow you
one more crack at the midterm

11
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:17,587
under both of our supervision tomorrow.

12
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:19,727
Is this true, Ms. Shannon?

13
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,929
Have you assaulted Mr. Conniker?

14
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,564
Forget Protocol 3.
I want to kill that man.

15
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:24,950
I'm not an idiot, Grant.

16
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:26,883
I've noticed the changes.

17
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:48,888
Just a sec, hon.

18
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,097
Sure, slacker.

19
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:53,127
No, really, I got to take this.

20
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:54,193
Hayes.

21
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,096
Yeah.

22
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,735
Oh, relax.

23
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:01,083
Manning likes to bluster about ethics

24
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:02,007
and the environment,

25
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:04,099
but he'll fold as always.

26
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:06,922
Besides, this conference
is just a formality.

27
00:01:06,924 --> 00:01:08,457
Once I put the motion through,

28
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,925
it's through.

29
00:01:09,927 --> 00:01:11,994
That pipeline will move ahead
on schedule.

30
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:14,296
No! No, no, no, no.

31
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:15,464
We'll be out of that conference by noon

32
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,531
and still make our tee time.

33
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:18,064
You watch.

34
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,469
God.

35
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:23,638
I'm sweating like a pig here.

36
00:01:24,041 --> 00:01:25,940
This exercise is gonna kill me.

37
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:28,477
Oh, honey...

38
00:01:29,144 --> 00:01:30,645
don't be silly.

39
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:33,648
That isn't gonna be what kills you.

40
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:54,902
Aah!

41
00:01:54,904 --> 00:01:56,404
Help!

42
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:59,039
Help! Somebody, help!

43
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:19,267

00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:24,597
Mm... that smells good.

45
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:27,834
Fine grind, organic.

46
00:02:27,836 --> 00:02:29,595
I know it sounds snobby,

47
00:02:29,597 --> 00:02:31,922
but you just wait...
tastes even snobbier.

48
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,712
Thank you.

49
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:36,382
No problem.

50
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,748
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:49,094
No. Um... It's just...

52
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:54,460
What?

53
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:58,893
I don't think I can do this anymore.

54
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:02,645
Do what?

55
00:03:03,103 --> 00:03:04,637
This, you...

56
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,772
staying here with me.

57
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:08,874
No, you don't need to worry.
I talked to your boss.

58
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:11,109
It's not about my job, Marcy.

59
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,078
It's... so, you talked to my... boss?

60
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,047
Uh, yeah, it's settled.

61
00:03:16,637 --> 00:03:17,979
What were you going to say?

62
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,990
This pretending

63
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:22,646
to be something that we're not...

64
00:03:23,957 --> 00:03:27,658
I keep saying that it's platonic, but...

65
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,822
if I'm being honest with myself...

66
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,467
Oh...

67
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:38,279
It's okay.

68
00:03:39,905 --> 00:03:42,568
I-I think maybe...

69
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:51,615
it's best if you found your own place.

70
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:54,985
Oh.

71
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,805
Um...

72
00:03:58,024 --> 00:03:59,349
I-I didn't realize...

73
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:02,826
The last thing I want is to upset you.

74
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,202
You should go to work.

75
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:10,237
And... don't worry about me.
I'll find a place tonight.

76
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,168
I mean, it doesn't...

77
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,533
ahem... have to be tonight.

78
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,305
It's fine.

79
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:18,174
I understand.

80
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:19,609
Do you?

81
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:24,495
Don't leave tonight,
'cause I got dinner...

82
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,528
David.

83
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,902
It is okay.

84
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:31,764
Just, um... you should go to work.

85
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:13,061
Excuse me.

86
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:16,568
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, I do.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,068
I mind what's going on
between you and Carly.

88
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,202
Carly?

89
00:05:21,204 --> 00:05:22,670
Mm. Don't pretend you don't know.

90
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:23,671
That'll just piss me off.

91
00:05:23,673 --> 00:05:25,239
Right.

92
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,208
And we all know what you do
when you get pissed off,

93
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,675
don't we?

94
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:30,111
I would not suggest
you try that with me.

95
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,912
Definitely not here.

96
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,913
Okay.

97
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,424
I'll talk to you man to man, all right?

98
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,618
Carly and I had a fight,

99
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,452
we separated,

100
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:39,353
you had some fun with her...

101
00:05:39,355 --> 00:05:40,921
"Fun with her"?

102
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:48,561
- I seen you around, all right?
- If you're implying that Carly and I...

103
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:49,730
I'm just here to tell you

104
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,531
that she's the mother of my child,

105
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:54,160
and I'm trying to get
my family back together.

106
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:55,936
But if you're in my way...

107
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,137
Actually, you're in my way.

108
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,238
If you wouldn't mind pressing "down."

109
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,607
Do you think that this is funny?

110
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:02,808
No, I think it's pathetic.

111
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,643
I've interviewed Carly Shannon...

112
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:04,844
"Interviewed"?

113
00:06:04,846 --> 00:06:06,012
...On official business, yes,

114
00:06:06,014 --> 00:06:07,813
during which time
the bruises on her arms

115
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,982
and her forehead were pretty
goddamned unmistakable.

116
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:11,884
Okay, accidents happen, man.

117
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:13,453
Not anymore they don't.

118
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:16,292
Does your wife know
that Carly's half your age?

119
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,724
You know, if you were smart...

120
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:21,493
you'd realize that Carly's
not going to put up

121
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:24,830
with an abusive, alcoholic,
loser beat cop anymore,

122
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:26,966
and you'd move on.

123
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,809
I'll wait for the next one.

124
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:41,846
You don't have your GED?

125
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:44,783
Uh, um... that should
come through this week.

126
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:47,386
I, uh, did the test already.

127
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:49,188
Just waiting on the papers, Mr. Donald.

128
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,255
Uh, "Hank." Call me Hank.

129
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:57,162
So, do you have

130
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:59,241
any experience in landscaping?

131
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:01,099
No, but I'm a fast learner.

132
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:04,435
Um, okay, this question

133
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:07,612
is not intended to be in any way sexist,

134
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:11,275
but it is a requirement
of this workplace,

135
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,443
so don't be offended.

136
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:14,911
What?

137
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:18,187
Can you lift that bag?

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,457
Where would you like it?

139
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,338
Back on the pile's good.

140
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,233
All right.

141
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:37,567
Come on in tomorrow.

142
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:38,802
We'll get you all set up,

143
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:40,704
and we'll see what you're made of.

144
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:44,207
Um, I'll, uh... I'll be here at six.

145
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,543
Uh, okay, but everybody else

146
00:07:46,545 --> 00:07:48,378
will be here at seven, so...

147
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:51,681
Sounds good, Hank.

148
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:58,020
Sit down, superstar.

149
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:07,250
School called,

150
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:10,767
and your mother wasn't here,
so I had to answer it.

151
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:13,068
You skipped out on another test.

152
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,436
I can explain.

153
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:16,645
They're suspending you for a week.

154
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,574
I understand.

155
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,075
No, I don't think you do.

156
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:22,511
Two of your teachers don't even
want you back in their class,

157
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:24,380
which means you don't have
enough credits to graduate.

158
00:08:24,382 --> 00:08:25,426
I can make up the tests.

159
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:27,149
No, you've already ditched
too many of those.

160
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:30,418
Your mother and I have decided

161
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,754
that we're sending you
to a military boarding school.

162
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:34,189
You're sending me away?

163
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,191
Just for eight months. In Idaho.

164
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:38,693
You can get your grades up,
learn about responsibility,

165
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:40,653
and reapply to colleges next spring.

166
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:42,363
I think we need to talk about this more.

167
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,537
Well, I'm sorry.

168
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:46,033
It's not up to you.

169
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:49,069
Gary?

170
00:08:49,645 --> 00:08:51,906
Aren't we talking more?

171
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:56,778
Gary!

172
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:45,024
What the hell?

173
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:15,387
It's a combination
of digital and mechanical.

174
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:16,788
Not easy to bypass,

175
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,023
but definitely based on our tech.

176
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:18,991
Well, I hope so,

177
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,439
considering how it was left in my car.

178
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:23,528
I mean, no interface

179
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,162
or remote signal?

180
00:10:25,164 --> 00:10:27,247
Trying that right now.

181
00:10:28,368 --> 00:10:31,502
You're right.
It definitely opens remotely.

182
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,875
Maybe if I can...

183
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:39,096
No. Shit!

184
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,478
Uh, if I can use a proxy...

185
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,014
No, that's stupid too.

186
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:45,930
Hey! If there's one thing you're not...

187
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,586
I'm sorry, boss. My head isn't clear.

188
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:53,157
Look, if you need a little
to function properly,

189
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,158
I won't stop you.

190
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,526
No. No.

191
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:57,602
I need to try for
at least a few more hours.

192
00:10:59,565 --> 00:11:01,364
Staying clean is harder than I thought.

193
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,179
How can I help?

194
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,836
I'm getting help, actually.

195
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:07,371
Support groups.

196
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:09,339
My friend Ray has been taking me.

197
00:11:10,043 --> 00:11:11,875
A friend? Oh.

198
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:13,043
Good.

199
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:14,710
Well, c-can you scan it?

200
00:11:14,712 --> 00:11:16,179
See what's inside?

201
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,230
If this doesn't work,
I'll have to run a few programs,

202
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:37,543
try and brute-force a key code.

203
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,742
The case is lined.

204
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,713
They really wanted
to keep it a secret from you.

205
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:53,315
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do with the damn thing,

206
00:11:53,317 --> 00:11:55,784
other than keep it on me at all times.

207
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,219
The Director must have a plan.

208
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:58,297
Yeah.

209
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,390
What else is new?

210
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:37,658
Can I help you?

211
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,327
Good morning, Mrs. MacLaren.
Do you have a moment to talk?

212
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:42,019
About what?

213
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:43,063
Don't be alarmed.

214
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,859
I'm actually here
about a personal matter.

215
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:01,150
Hello?

216
00:13:01,152 --> 00:13:02,284
Hey.

217
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:03,752
Sorry, did... did I wake you?

218
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:05,754
No. It's okay.

219
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,354
Cool. Um...

220
00:13:08,092 --> 00:13:10,226
Anyway, I just wanted to let you know

221
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:12,161
when I was going to be around today

222
00:13:12,163 --> 00:13:16,135
in case you needed help
getting your things.

223
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,666
I mean, not that you need help
with your things,

224
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:22,904
but if you did, I-I can help.

225
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:24,984
Or I can not be around.

226
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:27,342
You know, alternatively.

227
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:30,278
No. Uh... it'd be
great if you were there,

228
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,380
if you don't mind.

229
00:13:31,382 --> 00:13:33,447
No! No, not at all.

230
00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:34,282
Um...

231
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:37,085
When are you going to be around?

232
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:38,353
I can be around all day,

233
00:13:38,355 --> 00:13:39,854
if that works.

234
00:13:39,856 --> 00:13:43,791
Okay, well, uh, I will
see you this afternoon.

235
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,002
Okay.

236
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:46,727
Okay.

237
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,429
Bye.

238
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Good morning, 3468.

239
00:14:13,322 --> 00:14:15,122
I'm here to brief you on your mission.

240
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:16,634
You are...?

241
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:18,158
3112.

242
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,893
You can go now.

243
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:27,300
Your target is Congressman Bishop.

244
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,804
"Target." What is that supposed to mean?

245
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:32,839
That's the word the messenger used.

246
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:35,675
Bishop will be seated next to you...

247
00:14:35,677 --> 00:14:36,843
in First Class.

248
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,936
1A and 1B.

249
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,280
This flight is today.

250
00:14:41,282 --> 00:14:42,514
Is that a problem?

251
00:14:42,516 --> 00:14:44,327
No, I just...

252
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:48,787
to be honest, I've never
been in an aircraft before.

253
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,957
Shouldn't I have luggage, or...?

254
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,958
You have the case.

255
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:53,292
Of course.

256
00:14:53,294 --> 00:14:54,726
That's all you need.

257
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,094
Your credentials will
get it through security.

258
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,763
It will open at the appropriate time,

259
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,331
and you'll be made aware of its purpose.

260
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,433
I'm gonna need a little more than that.

261
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:02,601
I don't have more than that.

262
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,004
If you wouldn't mind dropping me off

263
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,172
where I'm going...

264
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:08,440
You do know I'm a federal agent?

265
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:11,009
It's just a few more blocks.

266
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,149
Good morning.

267
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:19,550
I know I'm a bit early.

268
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,186
I figured I'd get a head start on...

269
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,220
Carly, um...

270
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,689
Our needs have actually changed,

271
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,724
so I'm afraid we don't
have a job to offer you.

272
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,225
Okay. Uh, well,

273
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,326
if you wouldn't mind keeping me
in mind for the future...

274
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,862
Um, we're never

275
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,130
gonna be able to offer you
a job here, darling. Sorry.

276
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,833
Why not?

277
00:15:36,362 --> 00:15:37,902
You know why.

278
00:15:38,664 --> 00:15:40,705
No, I don't, actually.

279
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,139
Sir, I really need this job.

280
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,174
Our background check

281
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:46,243
revealed the charges on your record.

282
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:49,113
Assaulting a police officer?
Come on, kiddo.

283
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,458
You don't understand.
He's the father of my child.

284
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,084
And that makes it better... how?

285
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,994
You know, the 21st
has this service called "Uber."

286
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:05,896
You may want...

287
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,030
It's my wife. Excuse me.

288
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,565
Hey, Kat.

289
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,900
Where are you?

290
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,868
On my way to the airport, apparently.

291
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,036
We need to talk.

292
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,270
I can't right now.

293
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:17,373
I've just been assigned
escort duty to D.C.

294
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,743
The flight's at, uh... 1:30 today.

295
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:21,944
You're leaving?

296
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:23,346
Yeah, it's just for one night.

297
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:24,747
I'll-I'll call you as soon as I...

298
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,133
Kat?

299
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:29,085
At least you weren't ordered
to assassinate her.

300
00:16:29,499 --> 00:16:31,326
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

301
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:33,856
I'm about to attend a funeral service.

302
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,462
What do you think it means?

303
00:16:35,993 --> 00:16:37,563
You can pull over here.

304
00:17:00,164 --> 00:17:01,341
How's it coming?

305
00:17:02,786 --> 00:17:04,719
I'm having a hard time understanding

306
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:06,721
how one plant
is more important than another,

307
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:09,317
but I'm doing what you asked.

308
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:11,919
We need to talk.

309
00:17:12,629 --> 00:17:13,928
Don't think I haven't noticed

310
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,763
that things are changing between us.

311
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:18,716
You struck me

312
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,870
and now you're sending me away
to military school.

313
00:17:22,872 --> 00:17:24,305
Those changes?

314
00:17:24,307 --> 00:17:26,640
I-I'm talking about
since you quit football.

315
00:17:26,642 --> 00:17:27,808
Since my concussion?

316
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,809
I'm saying...

317
00:17:30,613 --> 00:17:32,779
There comes a time
in every young man's life

318
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:35,082
when he stops putting his father
up on a pedestal

319
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:36,317
and just sees him as...

320
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,252
...As the man that he really is.

321
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:42,022
Exactly. That guy.

322
00:17:43,158 --> 00:17:46,259
- Yeah.
- Look, I just... I just wanted to say...

323
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,595
you know, guy to guy, man to man...

324
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:51,385
I'm sorry things have gone south
between us, and...

325
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,101
I'm doing my best here.

326
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,676
Oh, and, uh...

327
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:06,446
you don't have to do that anymore.

328
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:07,847
Your mother told me to do it

329
00:18:07,849 --> 00:18:09,682
while she was away at her sister's.

330
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:16,722
Gary?

331
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,626
Is there golf on later today?

332
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:22,494
1:00.

333
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:24,163
Maybe we could watch it together.

334
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:45,717
Here we go. Give me a sec, guys.

335
00:18:46,753 --> 00:18:48,086
Carly, how can I help you?

336
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,654
You can explain why a background check

337
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:52,157
by a potential employer
showed an assault charge.

338
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:54,592
Well, maybe it was after
you punched me in my face

339
00:18:54,594 --> 00:18:55,660
and stole my car.

340
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:56,961
How many times have you struck me?

341
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,429
You know, come to think of it...
maybe it was after

342
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:01,265
you kicked me in my nuts
outside the babysitter's house.

343
00:19:01,267 --> 00:19:02,500
A witness probably called it in.

344
00:19:02,502 --> 00:19:04,502
Right. Well, I'm sure someone inside

345
00:19:04,504 --> 00:19:07,037
would be interested in hearing
the other side of the story.

346
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,574
They all know I'm a good family man.

347
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:13,411
What do you want?

348
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:16,347
I want us.

349
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,882
My son. My family.

350
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:20,217
Oh, my God. All right, Jeff,

351
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,586
I'm gonna let you in on a secret. Okay?

352
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:25,155
That night

353
00:19:25,157 --> 00:19:27,645
you smashed my head
into the kitchen counter?

354
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:30,260
You were gonna kill me.

355
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:32,262
What're you talking about?

356
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:33,597
Let me tell you how...

357
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,432
I was gonna open the kitchen drawer,

358
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:37,434
get out your spare gun to defend myself,

359
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:40,136
but you were going to be
too strong and too fast.

360
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:42,138
The gun was gonna go off,

361
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,873
and I was going to bleed out
on the floor.

362
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,839
That is batshit crazy talk.

363
00:19:46,545 --> 00:19:48,645
Carly, you need help.

364
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:52,048
What I needed was a decent job,

365
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,951
and you just took that from me.

366
00:20:02,794 --> 00:20:03,960
Smooth.

367
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,399
Philip, you there?

368
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:12,268
What's up, boss?

369
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,569
I'm heading out of town.

370
00:20:13,571 --> 00:20:14,836
I just received mission instructions

371
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,838
through another Traveler.

372
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,807
Where do you want us? I can...

373
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:19,841
be ready in five.

374
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,443
No, this one's a solo assignment.

375
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:23,245
I'm flying to D.C.

376
00:20:23,247 --> 00:20:24,313
I'll be out of com reach

377
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:26,481
when the plane gets above 20,000 feet,

378
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:29,251
which is a terrifying thought
unto itself,

379
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:30,752
but I'll check in by cell

380
00:20:30,754 --> 00:20:33,021
once we're on the ground,
about 6:30 your time.

381
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:36,124
Statistically,
it is the safest way to travel.

382
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:38,160
While strapped to a chair
moving through the sky,

383
00:20:38,162 --> 00:20:39,360
but thanks for trying.

384
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:52,674
Good evening.

385
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:54,067
Hello.

386
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,345
Oh. Hi.

387
00:20:57,347 --> 00:20:58,345
Mr. MacLaren. Perfect.

388
00:20:58,347 --> 00:21:00,547
And just to your right.

389
00:21:02,518 --> 00:21:04,312
Hi! Welcome.

390
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:07,688
Perfect. And just down the aisle
to your right.

391
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,192
Oh. Sorry.

392
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:19,366
Sir? I can stow that
in the overhead compartment,

393
00:21:19,368 --> 00:21:20,367
if you like.

394
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:22,703
No, no, I'll keep it with me. Thanks.

395
00:21:25,006 --> 00:21:27,073
Hi. Welcome.

396
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:28,642
Perfect, sir, and just down
the aisle to your left.

397
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:33,546
Hello. Mr. Bishop? Perfect.

398
00:21:33,548 --> 00:21:36,216
And just here to your right.

399
00:21:36,218 --> 00:21:37,217
Hi.

400
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:45,258
Excuse me.

401
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:54,734
What a day.

402
00:21:54,736 --> 00:21:56,902
Yeah. Same here.

403
00:21:56,904 --> 00:21:57,903
I'm, uh...

404
00:21:57,905 --> 00:21:59,338
Excuse me.

405
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,455
Jim?

406
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:02,842
Yeah, it's me. I'm on the plane now.

407
00:22:02,844 --> 00:22:04,442
Just left the funeral.

408
00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:07,946
Well, it was fine. It was a funeral.

409
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:10,969
Yeah, you know I'm ready.

410
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,952
I've already spoken with the board.

411
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:16,788
Hayes' death shouldn't
hold up our plans at all.

412
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,357
We'll get the bill signed,

413
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:21,025
have the pipeline flowing in no time.

414
00:22:22,028 --> 00:22:23,762
Okay, see you back in D.C.

415
00:22:23,764 --> 00:22:24,929
Bye.

416
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,762
Mac?

417
00:22:53,612 --> 00:22:55,212
You've reached
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

418
00:22:55,214 --> 00:22:56,813
Please leave a message at the tone.

419
00:22:58,617 --> 00:23:00,316
Hey, it's me.

420
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:01,474
Um...

421
00:23:02,688 --> 00:23:04,715
I really need to talk to you.

422
00:23:05,657 --> 00:23:06,757
It's Jeff.

423
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,025
He is literally sabotaging my identity.

424
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:13,062
I think you're the only one
that can help.

425
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,033
Ladies and gentlemen,

426
00:23:17,035 --> 00:23:18,301
this is your captain speaking.

427
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:19,468
You'd think the executive class

428
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,171
would be more spacious, huh?

429
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:25,208
Well, I don't really have
a frame of reference.

430
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,143
First time up front?

431
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:28,677
Mm-hmm.

432
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:31,000
Not a lot of difference

433
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,382
at 35,000 feet.

434
00:23:32,384 --> 00:23:34,016
Same paper-thin aluminum tube

435
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:35,250
as back there.

436
00:23:35,252 --> 00:23:36,351
Paper-thin?

437
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:37,753
Oh, relax.

438
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:39,422
You got a better chance
of being eaten by a shark

439
00:23:39,424 --> 00:23:41,490
than being in a plane crash.

440
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:44,092
Well, then I'm glad
we're not flying over water.

441
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:45,661
Sir?

442
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:47,430
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn off your phone, please.

443
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:49,932
I'm a U.S. Congressman. It's fine.

444
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:51,979
Well, it's a privilege

445
00:23:52,004 --> 00:23:53,217
to have you onboard, Congressman,

446
00:23:53,219 --> 00:23:55,337
but we still need you to
turn off your phone, please.

447
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:58,106
Once we're in the air, you'll
have full access to our wifi.

448
00:23:58,108 --> 00:23:59,686
Thank you.

449
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:02,610
I tell you, not many perks

450
00:24:02,612 --> 00:24:04,879
to positions of power these days.

451
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:06,708
Front row.

452
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:08,550
What do you do?

453
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:10,718
FBI. Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

454
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,053
Ted Bishop.

455
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:13,788
Should've known by the suit, right?

456
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,792
I'm just kidding.

457
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:20,558
So I guess you heard
about Secretary Hayes' death?

458
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,363
Your division handling that?

459
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:23,530
We are.

460
00:24:24,128 --> 00:24:25,246
Well, good on you.

461
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:27,734
Oop, we're off.

462
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:30,371
Oh. Good.

463
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,886
You said I needed help,
and you're right.

464
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:47,621
I need help with our son.

465
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:49,155
Right now?

466
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:50,791
Call it a peace offering.

467
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,659
Carly, I'm not stupid.

468
00:24:52,661 --> 00:24:54,628
And I'm not going to play
babysitter every time that you...

469
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,762
I have a couple of job interviews.

470
00:24:56,764 --> 00:24:58,959
I'm just going to have
to tell the truth.

471
00:24:59,461 --> 00:25:00,839
See what happens.

472
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:03,138
If you really want to start
mending this relationship,

473
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,371
here's a chance.

474
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:07,246
Hey?

475
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:12,058
Hey, big guy.

476
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:16,154
How much time do you need?

477
00:25:16,156 --> 00:25:18,557
How about you spend
a few hours with your son,

478
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,592
see what it's like?

479
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,439
Hey, hey-hey.

480
00:25:25,753 --> 00:25:28,053
Come on. You can
chill with Dad for a bit.

481
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:30,221
Huh? Go for some ice cream?

482
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:32,172
Play some Space Kabob.

483
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,293
Shoot some guns?

484
00:25:34,295 --> 00:25:36,359
I'm just joking.
We're not gonna shoot no guns.

485
00:25:43,136 --> 00:25:44,135
Hey.

486
00:25:44,137 --> 00:25:44,969
Hey.

487
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:47,438
Come in. Come on in.

488
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,142
I, uh, haven't packed up...
anything up for you,

489
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:53,211
because I wasn't sure what you wanted.

490
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:55,246
Oh, I don't have much stuff.

491
00:25:55,248 --> 00:25:58,216
Yeah, no, I was meaning
more, like, my stuff

492
00:25:58,218 --> 00:25:59,317
that you might need.

493
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:01,485
I'm not taking your things, David.

494
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:03,921
Ah, but why... why do I need
all this stuff for myself?

495
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:06,390
I mean... Do you have a kettle?

496
00:26:08,561 --> 00:26:13,631
'Cause everybody needs a kettle
for, like... tea.

497
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:14,932
So take it.

498
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:16,200
I insist.

499
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:17,505
Okay.

500
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:27,952
This is...

501
00:26:29,448 --> 00:26:30,480
this is a lot harder

502
00:26:30,482 --> 00:26:31,982
than I thought it was going to be.

503
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,308
Yeah, it's hard for me too.

504
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,166
Is it?

505
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,141
Mm-hmm.

506
00:26:37,202 --> 00:26:38,435
I don't know if that's possible, Marcy,

507
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:40,504
because I feel like I'm dying here.

508
00:26:44,364 --> 00:26:45,442
What?

509
00:26:45,444 --> 00:26:47,110
Nothing.

510
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:49,379
No, you were gonna say something.

511
00:26:54,096 --> 00:26:55,618
Thank you for the kettle.

512
00:26:58,387 --> 00:26:59,386
That's not it.

513
00:27:00,489 --> 00:27:02,391
What were you gonna say? Tell me.

514
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:08,036
I'm dying.

515
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,670
You mean that you feel the same way?

516
00:27:16,074 --> 00:27:17,573
I do feel the same way,

517
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:19,341
but...

518
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:23,912
That's not what I'm saying.

519
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:31,037
No.

520
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:32,854
The seizures

521
00:27:32,856 --> 00:27:34,289
that you've been helping me treat,

522
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,491
those are... those are just symptoms.

523
00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:39,227
This is way too freaking much.

524
00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:41,908
Everything that we've been doing

525
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:44,832
has just been to buy time.

526
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:49,070
I don't have that long.

527
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:53,774
And you were just gonna leave?

528
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:56,611
I don't want you to have
to go through all of that.

529
00:27:56,613 --> 00:27:59,880
What have I been telling you
about doing stuff alone?

530
00:28:00,172 --> 00:28:01,148
I mean, do you have any idea

531
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,583
what that would've done to me,

532
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:03,979
knowing that I kicked you out?

533
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:10,726
When?

534
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:18,900
Not today.

535
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,261
I could just hack in
and remove the charges.

536
00:28:48,263 --> 00:28:49,595
No, that won't do it.

537
00:28:49,597 --> 00:28:50,663
He'll just refile.

538
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:52,231
I need MacLaren to get involved,

539
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,099
use his FBI influence.

540
00:28:54,647 --> 00:28:56,402
He said he'd touch base once he landed.

541
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:59,605
Okay. 1:30 for D.C., right?

542
00:29:08,448 --> 00:29:10,983
Uh... flight 329 to Washington.
It just took off.

543
00:29:14,121 --> 00:29:15,754
329...

544
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:16,955
No.

545
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:18,957
No, no, no, no, no.

546
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:21,926
No... no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

547
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,928
What?

548
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,467
Marcy?

549
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:30,702
We have a problem.

550
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,268
Copy.

551
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,374
Copy what?

552
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,490
Trevor, we have a problem.

553
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,426
Copy that.

554
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:07,638
Um, uh, excuse me.

555
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,072
I, um, gotta take a leak.

556
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,006
Oh.

557
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,208
Sure.

558
00:30:38,972 --> 00:30:41,337
Kat? What are you doing here?

559
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,006
Oh, God. Grant, I'm sorry.
This is so embarrassing.

560
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,915
What?

561
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,745
I thought I was gonna find you
on here with another woman,

562
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,914
and then I saw you talking
to that man up front,

563
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,615
and I realized that I made a...

564
00:30:54,225 --> 00:30:55,535
Ladies and gentlemen,

565
00:30:55,537 --> 00:30:57,186
your Captain from the flight deck.

566
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,353
Uh, we've just entered

567
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:00,322
an unexpected area of turbulence.

568
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:03,759
Please return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

569
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:05,894
For Christ's sake, Kathryn, I'm working.

570
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:08,096
A police officer
came to our house this morning

571
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:10,532
and said that you're sleeping
with his wife.

572
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,133
What? That's...

573
00:31:12,135 --> 00:31:13,468
He told me her name

574
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,969
and said that he's seen you
leaving their house.

575
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:16,404
Sir, we need you to take your seat.

576
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:18,306
- Just a second.
- No, now, sir.

577
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:19,607
I'm a federal agent.

578
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:20,908
Well, I'm a flight attendant!

579
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,278
Go back to your seat!
I'm not asking again.

580
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,579
Grant, it's fine.
We can talk later. Just go.

581
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,663
This is nothing. Don't worry.

582
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,567
Guys, can you hear me?

583
00:31:54,213 --> 00:31:56,779
This is Mac. Can anybody hear me?

584
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,727
Boss, can you hear us?

585
00:32:00,729 --> 00:32:02,228
The plane hasn't descended
far enough yet.

586
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,229
Anybody?

587
00:32:03,231 --> 00:32:05,264
Can anybody hear me?

588
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:07,233
Yeah. We can hear you.
Is everything okay?

589
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:10,069
No. No. I think we're descending.

590
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,436
Has the case opened yet?

591
00:32:12,673 --> 00:32:14,522
Uh, not... not yet.

592
00:32:15,243 --> 00:32:17,576
Philip, what can you tell me
about this flight?

593
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,179
I didn't realize

594
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:24,182
this was your flight
until it was too late.

595
00:32:24,184 --> 00:32:27,486
Flight 329 to Washington
goes down at 2:53 p.m.

596
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:29,521
on this day.

597
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,360
Are there any survivors?

598
00:32:35,362 --> 00:32:40,041
Boss... all 141 people onboard die.

599
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,012
Bet you wish you had
that free drink, eh?

600
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,547
Ladies and gentlemen,
your Captain again.

601
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:58,482
One of our gauges
is acting up over here,

602
00:32:58,484 --> 00:33:02,853
probably nothing, but, uh,
we've begun a slow turn.

603
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,187
Oh, Christ. Are we turned around?

604
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:06,524
I have to be in Washington by four.

605
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,357
Stand by.

606
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,959
Jesus, you smell that?

607
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,828
What is that?

608
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,331
Lithium batteries
catch fire in the cargo hold.

609
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:16,099
- Something's burning.
- What?

610
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:18,068
How does it go down?

611
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,336
The plane's already descending

612
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:22,205
and has made a slow turn back,
but doesn't make it.

613
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:23,640
Tell me how to stop it.

614
00:33:23,642 --> 00:33:26,843
Tell the pilot you need
to depressurize and climb.

615
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:28,411
Sir, if you don't sit down right now...

616
00:33:28,413 --> 00:33:29,646
Tell the Captain

617
00:33:29,648 --> 00:33:32,749
we need to depressurize
and start climbing.

618
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:34,417
Captain, there's smoke in the cabin!

619
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:36,419
The fire's burned
through the cargo liner.

620
00:33:36,421 --> 00:33:37,921
The flight systems will eventually fail.

621
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:41,723
Excuse me. Do you know...

622
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:43,871
It's too late to stop it.

623
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,228
Well, I'm pretty sure it is
my mission to save this plane.

624
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,229
Don't tell me...

625
00:33:47,231 --> 00:33:50,166
Wait. Stand by.

626
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:02,724
Grant! What's happening?

627
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,498
Grant!

628
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:12,087
What the hell are you doing?

629
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:13,689
I have my mission.

630
00:34:13,691 --> 00:34:14,990
Trevor, you need to tell me

631
00:34:14,992 --> 00:34:16,691
how to make a two-person stasis field

632
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:17,892
hold more than two people.

633
00:34:17,894 --> 00:34:19,227
Who's Trevor?

634
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:20,528
Those things use a ton of power.

635
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,197
What is that thing?
Who're you talking to?

636
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,231
Shut up for a second!

637
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:24,432
Find a way.

638
00:34:24,434 --> 00:34:26,267
This is why you were kept
in the dark on this one.

639
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:27,435
What do you mean?

640
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:28,436
We keep improvising.

641
00:34:28,438 --> 00:34:30,038
The Director must have known

642
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,906
you'd try
and save everyone on the plane.

643
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:33,608
You can't do it, boss.

644
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,110
I'm not trying to save everyone,

645
00:34:36,112 --> 00:34:38,212
I'm trying to save my wife,

646
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:40,748
who decided to surprise me mid-air.

647
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,149
I'm talking about three people.

648
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:43,584
There has to be a way.

649
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:49,089
Stand by.

650
00:34:51,227 --> 00:34:53,327
A stasis field means he's
going to need resuscitation.

651
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,794
Yeah, I know,
I'm prepared for that, but...

652
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:57,131
The wife's not on the manifest,
same with MacLaren.

653
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:58,265
They've already been scrubbed.

654
00:34:59,335 --> 00:35:00,767
- By who?
- Why does it matter?

655
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:03,137
Because technically none of us
were given this mission.

656
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,784
And we keep improvising,
and in case you haven't noticed,

657
00:35:05,786 --> 00:35:07,941
the future doesn't seem
to like it when we do that.

658
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:09,910
Mac's in trouble!
We're not turning back!

659
00:35:12,382 --> 00:35:14,080
Tell me what the hell's going on.

660
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:15,114
There's a fire in the cargo hold.

661
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:16,616
What?

662
00:35:16,618 --> 00:35:18,952
We're gonna get through this,
but you have to listen to me

663
00:35:18,954 --> 00:35:20,319
and do exactly as I tell you.

664
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:22,088
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've had a small fire

665
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,456
in our cargo hold.

666
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,192
The fire suppression system
has activated.

667
00:35:26,194 --> 00:35:27,993
I'm confident we'll be fine,

668
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:29,362
but as a matter of caution,

669
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:31,431
we are performing an emergency descent.

670
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:32,432
Look at me. Look at me.

671
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:33,966
The Captain's wrong.

672
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:36,202
This plane is gonna crash,
and nothing can stop that now.

673
00:35:36,204 --> 00:35:37,970
- Oh, my god.
- But I have a device.

674
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:38,871
What?

675
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:40,205
This box...

676
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:41,974
can generate an energy field

677
00:35:41,976 --> 00:35:43,442
that will temporarily

678
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:45,143
hold our bodies in stasis
during the crash

679
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:46,845
and throw us clear of the debris field.

680
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:48,280
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.

681
00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:49,281
No. We're not going to die.

682
00:35:49,283 --> 00:35:50,415
Go ahead.

683
00:35:50,417 --> 00:35:51,650
Who the hell are you talking to?

684
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:53,018
I ran the numbers back to front.

685
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,786
There's no way
the stasis field generator

686
00:35:54,788 --> 00:35:56,221
can expand to fit three people.

687
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,722
We have to try.

688
00:35:57,724 --> 00:35:59,224
Don't! It's a question of mass.

689
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,725
Even two people is gonna be a stretch,

690
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:03,462
considering your angle of impact
and velocity.

691
00:36:04,266 --> 00:36:07,065
I'm sorry. We can't save her.

692
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,666
Ladies and gentlemen,

693
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:09,767
we need to prepare for a
possible emergency landing.

694
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:11,368
We have approximately five minutes

695
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,770
to prepare the cabin for landing,

696
00:36:12,772 --> 00:36:14,706
so undivided attention
is very important.

697
00:36:27,725 --> 00:36:29,114
Five minutes.

698
00:36:30,836 --> 00:36:33,071
...require you to open a door,

699
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:35,239
immediately pull
the red inflation handle

700
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:36,640
located at the base of door

701
00:36:36,642 --> 00:36:38,543
to ensure proper slide inflation.

702
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:40,578
Okay. It's time.

703
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:43,175
The seatbelt sign is on, sir!

704
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:45,616
Don't try to stop me. Please.

705
00:36:45,618 --> 00:36:47,517
Come on. Now.

706
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,786
I'm not going anywhere with you.

707
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:50,788
Every other person on this plane

708
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,155
is gonna die today,

709
00:36:52,157 --> 00:36:53,757
but you, for some reason, get to live,

710
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,059
so be humble and grateful

711
00:36:55,061 --> 00:36:56,560
and get your ass out of that seat

712
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:57,794
before I drag it out.

713
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,133
Ladies and gentlemen,

714
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:04,634
we will not make the airport.

715
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:07,237
We'll be making an emergency landing.

716
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,306
When I give the command "brace, brace,"

717
00:37:09,308 --> 00:37:10,740
assume the position
the crew has demonstrated

718
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:13,710
until the plane comes
to a complete stop.

719
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:14,911
Thank you.

720
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,902
What are you doing?

721
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:21,884
Before we brace for landing...

722
00:37:21,886 --> 00:37:22,919
Get back in your seats, now!

723
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:24,220
Grant? Where are you going?

724
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:25,655
...Put your head face-down in your lap,

725
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:27,456
and wrap your arms
underneath your knees.

726
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,959
If you are unable
to assume this position,

727
00:37:29,961 --> 00:37:31,293
cross your wrists

728
00:37:31,295 --> 00:37:33,129
and place them on the seat back
in front of you.

729
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:34,730
Rest your forehead on the seat back.

730
00:37:34,732 --> 00:37:37,433
Children should lean forward,
feet flat on the floor...

731
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:39,254
- Sit here.
- ...Place heads face-down in laps,

732
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:40,874
and wrap their arms
underneath their knees.

733
00:37:40,876 --> 00:37:43,071
Stay calm, and we're gonna be all right.

734
00:37:43,073 --> 00:37:45,174
I don't think I believe you anymore.

735
00:37:45,176 --> 00:37:46,808
It doesn't matter if you do or not.

736
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,344
Just do as I say, when I say it.

737
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:51,412
Philip?

738
00:37:51,414 --> 00:37:52,748
Go ahead.

739
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:54,750
Tell me about the crash site.

740
00:37:54,752 --> 00:37:56,115
Uh...

741
00:37:56,754 --> 00:37:58,453
They lose control of flight surfaces

742
00:37:58,455 --> 00:38:00,754
any moment now from fire damage below,

743
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:03,791
so it comes in steep and hits
in the middle of a field.

744
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:06,327
There isn't much left, but, uh...

745
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:07,328
But what?

746
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,630
The tail section.

747
00:38:08,632 --> 00:38:09,834
It's the only part of the plane
left intact

748
00:38:09,836 --> 00:38:11,732
in every picture
in the historical record.

749
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,385
So someone could survive if
they were in the tail section?

750
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:19,807
No! That's not what he said!
The G-forces would be huge!

751
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:20,653
Thank you.

752
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:21,668
No, y-you can't!

753
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,277
You don't have time to save her!

754
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:25,479
Hello?

755
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:29,884
- Stay here.
- You're leaving me?

756
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:32,153
I'll be right back. Don't move.

757
00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:42,935
Sir, sit down!

758
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,836
Sorry I took so long.

759
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,173
Wait. Where are we going?

760
00:38:53,613 --> 00:38:55,308
You were not supposed
to be on this flight.

761
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,743
I know, I'm sorry.

762
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:58,712
So I'm improvising.

763
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,415
Come on.

764
00:39:04,419 --> 00:39:07,420
Traveler 3468, you are off-mission.

765
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:10,256
- Oh, my god.
- Come on.

766
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,028
Grant, what did she say?

767
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,530
What was she talking about?

768
00:39:17,532 --> 00:39:19,232
Just stay with me.

769
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:24,870
Here.

770
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:26,238
Who the hell is this?

771
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,606
This is my wife. She's gonna
use the device with you

772
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:28,607
instead of me.

773
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:29,655
What device?

774
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:32,945
Just, here, hold this tight
and get close to each other.

775
00:39:32,947 --> 00:39:34,479
Come on. Closer. Closer.

776
00:39:34,481 --> 00:39:36,281
Whatever you do,
don't let go of each other.

777
00:39:36,283 --> 00:39:38,283
- Do you understand? No,
- I don't understand.

778
00:39:38,285 --> 00:39:39,517
Just trust me and listen.

779
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,786
When that light flashes red,

780
00:39:40,788 --> 00:39:42,265
you press it down. You hold it down.

781
00:39:42,267 --> 00:39:44,589
- Okay? That's all you have to do.
- No! Why can't you?

782
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,493
- Where are you going?
- You can do this.

783
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:47,000
No! Don't go!

784
00:39:48,795 --> 00:39:50,762
You're going to be okay.

785
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,613
45 seconds.

786
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:47,483
We see you coming in. Good luck.

787
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,625
Heads down! Stay down!

788
00:40:55,627 --> 00:41:01,286
Brace! Brace!
Brace! Brace! Brace! Brace!

789
00:42:00,055 --> 00:42:02,189
We need to separate them!

790
00:42:02,191 --> 00:42:03,557
Get her shirt.

791
00:42:06,228 --> 00:42:08,028
Where is he?

792
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:16,370
Clear?

793
00:42:18,774 --> 00:42:20,107
Oh, goddamn him!

794
00:42:23,445 --> 00:42:24,677
Clear!

795
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:29,181
He put himself in the tail.

796
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,423
Hi.

797
00:42:36,425 --> 00:42:37,857
We made it.

798
00:42:38,894 --> 00:42:40,059
We actually made it!

799
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:41,127
Grant? Where's Grant?

800
00:42:41,129 --> 00:42:42,194
Hi. It's okay.

801
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:44,730
That son of a bitch
was telling the truth.

802
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:49,735
Grant!

803
00:42:49,737 --> 00:42:52,305
Where's Grant? Grant?

804
00:42:52,307 --> 00:42:54,307
Oh!

805
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,337
You're not the EMT team I was expecting.

806
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:28,944
I'm Traveler 3569.

807
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:31,683
3326.

808
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:34,478
Welcome to the 21st.

809
00:43:38,851 --> 00:43:40,316
Oh, sh...

810
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:41,485
Wait. Wait.

811
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:42,652
How did they get here so fast, though?

812
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:43,520
No! No!

813
00:43:43,522 --> 00:43:44,688
Wait! Wait!

814
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:46,255
Carly! No!
We're not supposed to be here!

815
00:43:46,257 --> 00:43:47,457
Let go of me!

816
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,526
Let go! No! Let go!

817
00:43:57,881 --> 00:44:06,118
