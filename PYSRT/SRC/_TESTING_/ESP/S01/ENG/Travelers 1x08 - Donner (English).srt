1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:01,446
Previously on Travelers...

2
00:00:01,473 --> 00:00:03,827
That new doctor thinks
she's your sister.

3
00:00:03,862 --> 00:00:05,228
Yeah, she told me.

4
00:00:05,263 --> 00:00:06,563
Have you been sent a messenger?

5
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:08,332
Are you authorized
by The Director to talk to me?

6
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:09,299
Then step away.

7
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:10,934
Protocol 6, Agent MacLaren.

8
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,469
There's a reason
we're so compartmentalized,

9
00:00:12,504 --> 00:00:14,204
but there's teams of us
all over the world on missions,

10
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:15,138
and that's why...

11
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:16,206
Which is why there's a Protocol 6,

12
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:18,574
yeah, I get the rules,
but help me out here.

13
00:00:18,609 --> 00:00:19,942
You think I haven't seen
that white dude around?

14
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:20,843
Is that how you got these new wheels?

15
00:00:20,878 --> 00:00:22,778
You got a sugar daddy?

16
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:29,652
This is where any idea
you have of us ends.

17
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:31,887
I'll be right down!

18
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:36,023
Hey.

19
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:37,124
Sorry to keep you waiting.

20
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,626
That's all right.

21
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:42,530
It's the same price
whether I'm waiting or playing.

22
00:00:42,566 --> 00:00:43,965
At least you're cute.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,868
How do you know? You can't even see me.

24
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:49,270
Well... You sound cute.

25
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:53,173
All I'm saying is that trying to achieve

26
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,376
any true level of intimacy
over the Internet

27
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:58,846
is like trying to
save the environment using oil.

28
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:02,015
Mm. I love scented oils.

29
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,450
Are you hard?

30
00:01:06,722 --> 00:01:11,056
So... if you don't want to do that...

31
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:13,393
what do you want to do?

32
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:15,695
I want you tell me about
when you were happiest.

33
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,820
I thought I was never
gonna see her again.

34
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:44,789
And it made me so happy to...

35
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:46,390
to know that she was gonna be okay.

36
00:01:46,426 --> 00:01:47,825
You know?

37
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,159
That's beautiful.

38
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:11,213
What?

39
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:13,082
You really do sound hot.

40
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:14,984
Like, "dad hot."

41
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:17,085
Yeah. Thanks. Uh...

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,088
Look, Candy, you seem
like a lovely girl,

43
00:02:20,123 --> 00:02:22,458
and I'm sorry for
what's about to happen,

44
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:23,492
but this conversation is over.

45
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,126
But we just...

46
00:02:57,993 --> 00:03:00,560
Traveler 4019...

47
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:02,328
welcome to the 21st.

48
00:03:02,364 --> 00:03:03,763
Thank you.

49
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:05,699
Status report! Everyone all right?

50
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,066
All set.

51
00:03:07,102 --> 00:03:08,467
Let's get to work.

52
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:10,202
Someone should check on Donner.

53
00:03:47,426 --> 00:03:56,232
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

54
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:06,989
We've got multiple bodies

55
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:08,891
and remnants of the bomb out back.

56
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:10,125
Uh-huh.

57
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:11,353
Yeah, it looks like

58
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:13,362
some kind of adult industry
web cam operation.

59
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:14,730
Anything on these cameras?

60
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:16,932
Nah, they're all fried.
Even the servers.

61
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:18,232
Survivors?

62
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:19,734
None.

63
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,570
Bomb was placed right
next to the gas line.

64
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:23,004
Where's the bomber's body?

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,372
No idea.

66
00:04:24,407 --> 00:04:26,374
Local PD are canvassing the neighborhood

67
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:28,096
to see if anyone saw
them leaving the scene.

68
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:29,556
He's alive?

69
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:31,391
Well, assuming it's a "he."

70
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:34,360
Forensics should be here
any minute to do a sweep.

71
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,162
Why don't I go back to the office,

72
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:39,232
see what I can dig up about
the victims and this company?

73
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,067
Make me do the dirty work?

74
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:42,580
I called it.

75
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:45,037
Philip, you there?

76
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:46,318
What happened?

77
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,207
None of the girls survived,
and Donner's missing.

78
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:49,408
Missing?

79
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:50,842
He should be dead.

80
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:52,344
If the Traveler arrived,

81
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,079
he would've defused the bomb
like he was supposed to.

82
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:55,113
If he misfired...

83
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:57,115
Donner would have died. I know.

84
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,816
It doesn't make any sense.
What do you want to do?

85
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,352
Search the deep web for an S.O.S.

86
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,354
If the Traveler made it,
hopefully he'll reach out.

87
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,856
In the meantime,
send me the host's address.

88
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:05,957
Copy.

89
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,466
- Hi.
- Hey.

90
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:18,402
- You wanted to see me?
- Trevor, yes.

91
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:20,837
Uh, please have a seat.

92
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:22,572
How're you doing?

93
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:23,973
Everything okay?

94
00:05:25,143 --> 00:05:26,438
Transcendent.

95
00:05:26,463 --> 00:05:29,379
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about your physics midterm last week.

96
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:31,381
Uh... Not bad, right?

97
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,516
Well... also not good.

98
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:36,219
I had a meeting with
Mr. Morrissy yesterday,

99
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,553
and he believes you've been cheating.

100
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,022
What?

101
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:40,223
That's ridiculous.

102
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:41,990
Well, he wants to give you a zero.

103
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,992
No, I-I mean, I put in the work.

104
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:46,077
I got 90%. I told you I would.

105
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:49,331
You believe him?

106
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:51,099
You got every question right

107
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:52,434
except the last three.

108
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:53,668
Yeah, they were...

109
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:54,903
Which were also correct,

110
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:57,806
but you scratched out
to not seem suspicious.

111
00:05:58,313 --> 00:06:01,142
Now, Mr. Morrissy thinks
you had the answer key,

112
00:06:01,177 --> 00:06:02,977
and to be honest, Trevor,
it's hard to dispute that.

113
00:06:03,012 --> 00:06:04,211
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,916
What are the repercussions?

115
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,085
Well, I found a compromise.

116
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,586
I have convinced him

117
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:14,621
to allow you one more
crack at the midterm

118
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:16,722
under both of our supervision tomorrow.

119
00:06:16,758 --> 00:06:18,724
Oh, uh...

120
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,093
Okay.

121
00:06:22,086 --> 00:06:23,563
Why don't you come by
for third period today

122
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:25,298
and I'll help you study?

123
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,654
I'll be there.

124
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,679
Oh no!

125
00:06:41,648 --> 00:06:42,881
Hi!

126
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,084
Gonna be extra good
for Mommy today, okay?

127
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:02,666
Hey.

128
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:05,403
Hey. I just got your message.
Jeffrey will be fine.

129
00:07:05,438 --> 00:07:07,904
The rash is just
a common reaction to a vaccine,

130
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:10,432
but I can come over and check
on him later, if you'd like.

131
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:13,310
Uh, thank you, but no, that's okay.

132
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:14,444
I-I have a meeting.

133
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,658
A meeting?

134
00:07:18,249 --> 00:07:20,283
I have a hearing today.

135
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:22,552
Jeffrey's father wants custody.

136
00:07:22,587 --> 00:07:24,153
Oh. Why don't you just let him have it?

137
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:25,554
I'm the boy's mother.

138
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:27,556
No, actually, you're not.

139
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,758
And it would make it
a lot easier to go on missions.

140
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:32,294
I'm not leaving my son
in the custody of that man,

141
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,862
and that's all there is to it.

142
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:36,365
Well, then you're gonna
have to fight for him.

143
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:37,962
I know.

144
00:07:51,548 --> 00:07:53,281
Oh, my god.

145
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:54,615
Oh, my god!

146
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:57,918
Oh, my god! No!

147
00:07:57,953 --> 00:08:00,220
No!

148
00:08:00,256 --> 00:08:01,522
Oh!

149
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:04,658
This is all my fault!
This is all my fault.

150
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:11,498
- Hey, boss?
- Yeah?

151
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:12,499
I sent you Donner's address.

152
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:13,967
Thanks.

153
00:08:14,002 --> 00:08:16,569
If you were injured in the field
and needed to patch yourself up,

154
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:17,970
where would you go?

155
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:19,853
Pharmacy, veterinary clinic...

156
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,841
- Commercial kitchen...
- Hold on.

157
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,278
I'll get back to you.

158
00:08:32,086 --> 00:08:33,051
FBI.

159
00:08:35,054 --> 00:08:39,436

160
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,502

161
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,549

163
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,299
_

164
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,105
Aaron Donner.

165
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:31,473
He was a regular.

166
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,742
I'd do private shows for him,
twice a day sometimes,

167
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:35,477
until things got weird.

168
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:37,078
He started sending packages,

169
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:39,913
and our policy is not
to encourage that sort of thing,

170
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:42,082
so I didn't respond.

171
00:09:42,118 --> 00:09:44,718
Aaron blamed the company
for coming between us,

172
00:09:44,754 --> 00:09:46,254
and then the threats started.

173
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,955
Threats?

174
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,158
He'd send religious hate mail,

175
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:53,461
saying that God would make
everyone pay for their sins,

176
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:54,962
that a day of reckoning would come.

177
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:56,263
He was crazy!

178
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:57,531
And then this morning...

179
00:09:57,566 --> 00:09:59,032
You're doing good.

180
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:02,302
He left me a voice mail
telling me not to come in,

181
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:05,004
that today was the day
he'd make them all pay.

182
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,507
I tried to warn the girls, but...

183
00:10:07,543 --> 00:10:10,009
It's okay. You're being very helpful.

184
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:12,479
Excuse me.

185
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,489
Beth?

186
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:27,293
Can you do a search
on an Aaron Donner for me?

187
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,742
Aaron Donner?

188
00:11:13,037 --> 00:11:14,637
Aaron Donner!

189
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:20,042
Do you know who I am?

190
00:11:21,612 --> 00:11:23,411
I'm 3468.

191
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:25,079
If you were hurt in the blast,

192
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:26,847
I can take you to our medic.

193
00:11:27,651 --> 00:11:29,817
I'm here to assist you.

194
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,554
Okay?

195
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,592
You can trust me.

196
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,506
These allegations are
fundamentally disgusting, David.

197
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:02,098
Marcy Warton is a client of yours!

198
00:12:02,133 --> 00:12:03,933
She is not who you think she is.

199
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:05,167
Are you in a relationship with her?

200
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:06,502
It's purely platonic.

201
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:08,381
So you don't deny living with her?

202
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:13,307
Because I have a thorough report
from an Officer Jeff Conniker

203
00:12:13,343 --> 00:12:17,095
that clearly implicates you
as her romantic partner.

204
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:20,181
Ken... you know I would never do that.

205
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:21,449
You're suspended until further notice.

206
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:23,151
- What?
- And don't think...

207
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:25,586
...that there won't be a full
investigation, David, because...

208
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:28,122
You know, just meet with her. Please.

209
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:29,790
Come see who we're talking about.

210
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:31,258
That's all I'm asking.

211
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,055
You won't change my mind.

212
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:40,167
Please, be seated.

213
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:45,171
Ms. Shannon, just so we're clear,

214
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:47,206
nobody's on trial today.

215
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:48,574
Okay?

216
00:12:48,609 --> 00:12:49,809
This is just an opportunity

217
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:52,220
for both sides to state their case

218
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:54,346
so we can work to find a resolution

219
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:55,755
that's best for your son.

220
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,422
Have you no representation?

221
00:12:57,447 --> 00:12:59,031
Actually, ma'am,

222
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:02,234
I was hoping you would
consider a postponement.

223
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,169
Sorry I'm late.

224
00:13:04,706 --> 00:13:06,272
I trust anything my client
has said up until this point

225
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:09,342
will be struck from the record.

226
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:12,311
We weren't notified
you'd be joining us, Mister...?

227
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:15,181
Really? Pearson. We've met twice.

228
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:16,449
Right.

229
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:17,649
S-Sorry.

230
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:18,784
If I may be frank, your honor,

231
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:20,385
I believe my client feared

232
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,054
the prospect
of Mr. Conniker's retribution

233
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,691
in response to her
simply defending herself.

234
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:29,260
I'm here to remind her
that she's not alone.

235
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:48,579
Philip, do...

236
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:45,733
_

237
00:14:47,901 --> 00:14:49,234
Hey. Welcome home.

238
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,105
Don't do that.

239
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:55,776
Do what?

240
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,578
That's what couples say,
when someone comes home,

241
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,912
the other one says, "Hey, welcome home,"

242
00:14:59,948 --> 00:15:02,405
but we're not a couple, it's platonic.

243
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:05,217
Okay, what should I say, then?

244
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:07,853
Just say "hello" like a normal person.

245
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:10,155
Hello.

246
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,192
Hi.

247
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,363
What's going on?

248
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,199
Uh, Ken knows you're staying here.

249
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:22,701
Ken?

250
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:25,003
My boss, and I should've known
it was going to come out.

251
00:15:25,038 --> 00:15:26,137
It's completely inappropriate.

252
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:27,672
Okay, then I'll leave.

253
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:28,940
I don't want you getting
in trouble for my actions.

254
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,809
No. No, no, no, no. I need you to stay.

255
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:32,744
We have to prove that you're not

256
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:34,578
who they think you are. That you're...

257
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:35,579
Batgirl?

258
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:39,449
That you're not the same person
that he met.

259
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:41,885
Oh, I've met Ken?

260
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:44,622
Ke... Yeah, like a dozen times. Ken.

261
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,390
Man, that hit on your head
really had an effect on you.

262
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:49,426
Just tell me about him.
I'll make it work.

263
00:15:49,461 --> 00:15:51,227
Well, I'm glad you're so confident,

264
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:53,329
because I could lose my job, Marcy.

265
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:54,964
Hell, I could go to jail.

266
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:56,933
Okay, well, what's the plan?

267
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:59,401
Right, so, it's not so much a plan

268
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:02,038
as it is that he's coming
for dinner tonight.

269
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,343
Okay.

270
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:08,977
I just want what's best for my son.

271
00:16:09,013 --> 00:16:10,478
Then start by paying child support.

272
00:16:10,514 --> 00:16:12,914
Every time I come by to talk
to you about it, you assault me.

273
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,282
I assault you?

274
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:15,751
Is this true, Ms. Shannon?

275
00:16:15,786 --> 00:16:17,218
Have you assaulted Mr. Conniker?

276
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:19,407
Are we really getting into abuse here?

277
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:21,841
You pay for everything in cash,
you're out crazy hours of the night.

278
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:23,091
I'm working.

279
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:25,325
And I think we all know
what your new job is.

280
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,327
Ms. Shannon is providing
for her child as best she can.

281
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:29,997
We're more concerned
about household environment

282
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:31,963
as a result of manner of income.

283
00:16:31,998 --> 00:16:34,131
You know, I'm just
gonna come out and ask.

284
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,839
- Are you a ho now, or what?
- Mr. Conniker!

285
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,908
There's at least one old white
guy coming around all the time.

286
00:16:41,943 --> 00:16:42,976
The money is coming from somewhere.

287
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,210
You watch your mouth!

288
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:45,578
- Carly, not helping.
- Shut up!

289
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:48,447
You have no idea who I am
or what I'm capable of.

290
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:49,883
Here's the rage we've talked about.

291
00:16:49,918 --> 00:16:52,585
You haven't seen rage yet.

292
00:17:56,114 --> 00:17:56,912
Freeze!

293
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:58,480
Whoa! Easy, partner!

294
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,418
Looks like we were just in time.

295
00:18:03,454 --> 00:18:04,419
He was about to make a run for it.

296
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:07,622
Packed bag, money, passport.

297
00:18:07,657 --> 00:18:08,623
You don't say.

298
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,727
Want to tell us where you were going?

299
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:17,932
Well... that went well.

300
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:20,268
Forget Protocol 3!
I want to kill that man!

301
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:23,175
As your lawyer, I advise against that.

302
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:25,505
Philip?

303
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,740
What's up?

304
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:28,242
Philip, can you arrange funds for me?

305
00:18:28,277 --> 00:18:30,477
I've had some unforeseen expenses.

306
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:31,645
Sure. It'll be tomorrow.

307
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
Bets take a day.

308
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:34,514
How much do you need?

309
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,360
Really?

310
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,086
"Field of Reference" states

311
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:40,620
that the speed of an object in motion

312
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:42,955
is dictated in relation
from where you're viewing it.

313
00:18:43,684 --> 00:18:44,747
Good. And how do you prove...

314
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:48,560
V ax = V ay - V XY.

315
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:50,304
When " y" is common in both vectors,

316
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,365
" y " is eliminated,
and leaves for " ax,"

317
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,233
the final answer.

318
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,736
Trevor, how have you learned all this?

319
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:01,173
Were you just not
applying yourself before?

320
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:03,809
Now that football's over,
I can be myself.

321
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:07,345
I don't have to conform
to anyone's expectations.

322
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,112
Right, but your parents,
your teachers, me...

323
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,792
we all want you to succeed,
with or without football.

324
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:14,119
You see that, right?

325
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,721
I feel that with you, yes.

326
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,457
Good.

327
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,793
But I'm tired of being told
who I should be,

328
00:19:23,327 --> 00:19:24,494
what I should do...

329
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,231
I want to define my own future.

330
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:30,334
I have a book I think you'd like.

331
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:40,109
Here.

332
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,495
Now, uh, let's get back to it,
get you ready for the test.

333
00:20:10,006 --> 00:20:11,772
The cameras are off. Talk to me.

334
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,141
I have nothing to say.

335
00:20:14,177 --> 00:20:15,176
I can help you.

336
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:17,078
Just tell me what
happened with the bomb.

337
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:18,812
It blew up.

338
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:21,415
Did you make any attempt to defuse it?

339
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,916
Why would I do that?

340
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,218
A higher power wanted
that bomb to go off.

341
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:26,519
Cut the bullshit.

342
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:29,289
I know you're 4022, you know I'm 3468.

343
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:31,758
There's no other way this makes sense.

344
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:35,061
It was my mission to greet
your team upon arrival,

345
00:20:35,097 --> 00:20:36,897
so you need to talk to me.

346
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:39,432
The longer you stay silent,
the less we can do.

347
00:20:39,467 --> 00:20:40,900
There's nothing you can do.

348
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:43,202
You're in a tough spot, I get it.

349
00:20:43,237 --> 00:20:45,670
I messed up my first mission too.

350
00:20:45,706 --> 00:20:48,802
But you're not alone.
There are other Travelers.

351
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:51,944
If we have some information,
we can help you out of this.

352
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:56,282
What the hell is a Traveler?

353
00:21:12,094 --> 00:21:13,594
Aaron Donner, I have a witness

354
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,331
that claims that you were
a longstanding client of hers.

355
00:21:16,366 --> 00:21:19,400
That is, until the company
slapped a court order on you.

356
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:20,990
I follow the rule of God.

357
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,937
I'm pretty sure "thou shalt not kill"

358
00:21:22,972 --> 00:21:24,339
is in your rulebook.

359
00:21:24,374 --> 00:21:26,207
You were obsessed.
You terrorized the poor girl.

360
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:27,674
I was saving Mindy.

361
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,409
She'll see that in time.

362
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:32,546
You blew up her workplace
in order to save her?

363
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:33,780
It was God's will.

364
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:35,915
You're looking at three counts
of first-degree murder.

365
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:36,991
They were sinful.

366
00:21:37,026 --> 00:21:39,252
They were?

367
00:21:39,287 --> 00:21:41,921
Well, it's gonna take
some kind of divine intervention

368
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:44,222
to save you from lethal injection.

369
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:47,025
Capital punishment?

370
00:21:47,061 --> 00:21:48,761
The state of Washington carries

371
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:51,129
the death sentence
for first-degree murder charges

372
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:53,131
with aggravated reasons.

373
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:54,299
I want a lawyer.

374
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:55,910
Now he wants a lawyer.

375
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:58,771
Yeah, we still got you
for an hour and seven minutes

376
00:21:58,806 --> 00:22:00,905
before the presence of a lawyer
is mandatory.

377
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:02,474
Then I'll wait.

378
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:04,085
But I'm done talking.

379
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,170
Marce, I g...

380
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,463
Hi, David.

381
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:49,504
Leave a message. I'll call you back.

382
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:53,288
I'll let you know
when the forensics come in.

383
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:55,390
Thanks, partner.

384
00:23:08,671 --> 00:23:11,439
Hi. I'm so glad you could join us.

385
00:23:12,374 --> 00:23:13,273
Marcy?

386
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,708
Ken.

387
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:18,211
Uh, we got your text
that you were running late.

388
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:19,547
David is just opening the wine,

389
00:23:19,582 --> 00:23:21,515
and I think dinner is almost ready.

390
00:23:21,551 --> 00:23:22,817
How goes the battle?

391
00:23:22,852 --> 00:23:25,552
Uh... Yeah.

392
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,372
David said your dog was sick.

393
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:28,888
My d...?

394
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:31,090
No, he's fine, it was indigestion.

395
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,224
Oh.

396
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,728
This is Marcy?

397
00:23:35,764 --> 00:23:37,096
This is Marcy.

398
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:39,966
And, uh, now you know
why I wanted you to see her.

399
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,968
I don't want to rush dinner,
but everything's ready, so...

400
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:43,969
Do you want to just get started?

401
00:23:44,004 --> 00:23:45,737
I hope you're hungry.

402
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:48,707
David made his famous pasta dish.

403
00:23:48,742 --> 00:23:49,670
Huh.

404
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:52,718
Well, it's always that or chicken.

405
00:23:52,753 --> 00:23:54,546
Yeah.

406
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:55,881
I'm sorry, Marcy,

407
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,216
you're gonna have to help me here.

408
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:59,351
I'm confused.

409
00:23:59,386 --> 00:24:01,418
I understand you have some concerns

410
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:03,356
about David's conduct regarding me,

411
00:24:03,391 --> 00:24:04,615
but I can assure you

412
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,493
that not only am I
no longer in his care,

413
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:09,326
but that our relationship
is purely platonic.

414
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,903
Platonic?

415
00:24:13,749 --> 00:24:15,057
Marcy?

416
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:18,146
Excuse me. Work.

417
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:23,818
Hey, sorry,
I know I'm breaking protocol,

418
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:25,120
but my com...

419
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:26,187
I'm interrupting.

420
00:24:26,223 --> 00:24:27,689
Agent MacLaren!

421
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:29,291
Don't be ridiculous, uh,
why don't you come and join us?

422
00:24:29,326 --> 00:24:32,294
You know what, David?
This'll just take a second.

423
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:45,038
It's a little late for a home visit.

424
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:47,742
I don't mind. Nice summer evening.

425
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,543
Given what transpired
at the meeting today,

426
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:51,311
I wanted to follow up.

427
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:54,180
And... I have a warrant this time.

428
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,484
Come on in.

429
00:25:07,828 --> 00:25:10,996
It's all pretty much the same
as last time you were here,

430
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:13,131
'cept for the John
in my closet, of course.

431
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,400
Ms. Shannon.

432
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:15,601
Carly.

433
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:18,003
Carly. I didn't agree
with how some aspects

434
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:20,238
of the meeting were handled,

435
00:25:20,274 --> 00:25:22,207
but your behavior was concerning.

436
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:24,509
Yeah, I can tell by how
you're inside my house again.

437
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:27,178
I'm not on anyone's side
but Jeffrey Junior.

438
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:29,681
My job is to make sure
that whatever happens

439
00:25:29,716 --> 00:25:31,182
is for his best welfare.

440
00:25:31,217 --> 00:25:32,684
I get that's your job,

441
00:25:32,719 --> 00:25:34,989
but I'm tired of being grilled.

442
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:37,990
I'm tired in general.

443
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,858
It is so hard doing this with no help.

444
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:46,697
Jeff is not a good man.

445
00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:51,000
And he's a cop, so I can't say anything.

446
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:53,203
I can't go to anyone.

447
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,405
He's doing this
because I won't be with him.

448
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:57,269
He's punishing me.

449
00:25:59,076 --> 00:26:01,410
Seriously, he's FBI,
and she works with him.

450
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:03,974
Though he can neither
confirm nor deny it.

451
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:09,102
It's a lot cooler when he says it.

452
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:14,089
I tried to call.
Is everything all right?

453
00:26:14,124 --> 00:26:16,123
It-It will be, but what do you need?

454
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,392
I need you to replace my com.

455
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:18,393
It got busted.

456
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:19,427
How?

457
00:26:19,463 --> 00:26:20,928
An altercation. I don't know how,

458
00:26:20,964 --> 00:26:22,797
but apparently the new
Traveler's a misfire.

459
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:25,099
I've been dealing with
a psychopath all day.

460
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:26,401
All right, well,

461
00:26:26,436 --> 00:26:27,569
I'll replace it first thing, okay?

462
00:26:27,604 --> 00:26:28,936
Excuse me.

463
00:26:28,972 --> 00:26:30,705
Could you please
show me some identification?

464
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,579
"Special Agent Grant MacLaren."

465
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:39,613
And you are?

466
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:40,877
Ken Palfy.

467
00:26:41,484 --> 00:26:42,383
She works for you?

468
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:45,532
Marcy is my associate, yes.

469
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:46,932
In what capacity?

470
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,522
Well, that's...

471
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:55,094
...none of your goddamn business, Ken.

472
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:58,130
Sorry for interrupting.

473
00:26:58,165 --> 00:26:59,399
Nice to see you again, David.

474
00:27:17,317 --> 00:27:20,084
Uh... Aaron Donner?

475
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,586
Did you say anything to them?

476
00:27:21,622 --> 00:27:24,588
No, but they have everything.

477
00:27:24,624 --> 00:27:25,856
I'm familiar with your case.

478
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:28,692
Right. Um, let's see here.

479
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:31,796
Okay, so they found
your fingerprints on the bomb,

480
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:32,996
and DNA came through

481
00:27:33,032 --> 00:27:34,566
with trace evidence that
places you at the scene.

482
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:37,000
If I have information.
Can I make a deal?

483
00:27:37,427 --> 00:27:39,202
What? Like a plea bargain?

484
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:41,170
No, I want the charges dropped.

485
00:27:41,205 --> 00:27:43,940
I want to go into witness protection,
new identity, everything.

486
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:46,108
That's not likely.

487
00:27:49,572 --> 00:27:51,714
I've gained knowledge
of a secret organization

488
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,183
that's infiltrated our society.

489
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:56,185
What?

490
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,486
There's a huge network of them.

491
00:27:57,521 --> 00:28:00,656
They operate outside the law,
and they're dangerous.

492
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:03,959
They've even infiltrated the FBI.

493
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:06,394
And how do you know all of this?

494
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,897
One of their operatives
gave himself away.

495
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,466
I think the Defense Department

496
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:13,969
would be very interested
to hear what I have to say.

497
00:28:16,606 --> 00:28:18,072
Okay.

498
00:28:18,107 --> 00:28:20,608
What is this organization?

499
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:22,343
They call themselves Travelers.

500
00:28:26,583 --> 00:28:28,248
Agent MacLaren is one of them.

501
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:36,954
You must've been born with
a horseshoe up your ass.

502
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:40,964
Where's the rest of it?

503
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:43,466
You got three races
out of five with those stupid odds.

504
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,365
Consider yourself a lucky man.

505
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:10,258
7-3-2-5.

506
00:29:18,901 --> 00:29:20,634
What?

507
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:40,152
Guys, we need to assemble
back at Ops A.S.A.P.

508
00:29:41,222 --> 00:29:43,055
On my way.

509
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:45,725
Copy.

510
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:46,793
On my way.

511
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:49,429
I just need to
finish up something at school.

512
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:55,971
Trevor? Your test isn't until 3:00.

513
00:29:57,535 --> 00:29:59,169
Actually, Ms. Day,

514
00:29:59,204 --> 00:30:02,772
I wanted to thank you
for lending me that book.

515
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:05,480
I really enjoyed it.

516
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:08,711
You finished it?

517
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:10,345
Uh-huh.

518
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,547
And I wanted to return the favor.

519
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,384
It was something that gave me comfort

520
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,155
during a very... lonely time.

521
00:30:22,164 --> 00:30:23,471
Well, thank you.

522
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:27,428
Enjoy.

523
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:40,842
Hey. You know he's just
gonna hang himself in there.

524
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:43,210
My client wants an audience
with the D.A.'s office,

525
00:30:43,245 --> 00:30:44,677
and they granted him that request.

526
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:46,312
- It's his right.
- He's insane.

527
00:30:46,348 --> 00:30:48,048
Well, it's not for you to decide.

528
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,783
Really? 'Cause I've pretty much
already decided.

529
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:08,634
Hey. You wanted to see me?

530
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:11,070
Your letter of resignation
on my desk in an hour.

531
00:31:11,105 --> 00:31:13,072
Turn in your I.D. and keys.

532
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:14,106
What?

533
00:31:14,142 --> 00:31:16,007
And I think you'll understand

534
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,508
that I can't give you a reference.

535
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,210
This can't still be about Marcy.

536
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,378
What do you think?

537
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:22,847
I think that you met her,

538
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,016
you saw her, you know what she does.

539
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:26,450
Steal from people

540
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:28,253
with actual disabilities
for over a year?

541
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:30,621
Do you know how much
she's drained from the system?

542
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,556
Because I do. Dollar for dollar.

543
00:31:32,592 --> 00:31:35,092
Do you know how many grants
we've been turned down for?

544
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,679
How many programs have been canceled

545
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:38,128
because I can't rely on the government

546
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:39,429
to even keep the lights on?

547
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,764
They won't support us,

548
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,956
but they don't give a shit
if they take from us.

549
00:31:41,991 --> 00:31:43,466
She didn't do any of that.

550
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,768
And what does this have to do with me?

551
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:47,271
You helped that woman
commit social assistance fraud.

552
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,738
I had no idea!

553
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,372
But when you found out,
did you come to me?

554
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,108
Did you? Did you say, "Hey, Ken,

555
00:31:52,143 --> 00:31:53,575
friend, boss...

556
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,078
Why don't you take a look at this?"

557
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,215
No. And now we're out her
base benefits for two years,

558
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,465
not to mention half the cost
of her apartment,

559
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,252
outings, time.

560
00:32:03,775 --> 00:32:06,655
I know you did things for her
out of your own pocket.

561
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,257
How can you not be furious at that?

562
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:11,559
It's important work she's doing.

563
00:32:11,594 --> 00:32:12,560
David...

564
00:32:12,595 --> 00:32:13,995
Wake up, man.

565
00:32:14,438 --> 00:32:15,897
She was playing you.

566
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,433
She was playing you then,
she's playing you now.

567
00:32:24,807 --> 00:32:25,840
You're right.

568
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,987
When I thought Marcy was somebody who...

569
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,099
needed my help,

570
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:33,644
I did do things out of my own pocket.

571
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:36,851
On my own time,

572
00:32:36,886 --> 00:32:38,853
because I care about my clients.

573
00:32:39,236 --> 00:32:42,488
So who are you gonna get to
do my case load now? Malcolm?

574
00:32:42,523 --> 00:32:44,490
'Cause he never does home visits.

575
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:46,392
He never takes his clients
to their appointments

576
00:32:46,427 --> 00:32:47,961
or teaches them how to socialize.

577
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:50,830
Will he know that
when Jason refuses to eat,

578
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:53,532
you got to pretend that
you're at his grandma's house?

579
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:55,768
I have put in more overtime than anyone,

580
00:32:55,803 --> 00:32:57,536
and we don't get paid overtime!

581
00:32:57,572 --> 00:32:58,737
But good luck!

582
00:32:58,772 --> 00:32:59,972
'Cause you're worried about
a few dollars!

583
00:33:00,007 --> 00:33:01,417
Try several thousand!

584
00:33:01,453 --> 00:33:02,941
Okay! Well, that's a lot!

585
00:33:02,977 --> 00:33:04,292
Yes, it is!

586
00:33:12,386 --> 00:33:13,852
Mr. Donner...

587
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:15,686
The Department of Justice
doesn't take kindly

588
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:17,421
to having its time wasted.

589
00:33:17,456 --> 00:33:18,856
In fact, that's why I'm here

590
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:20,992
and not the District Attorney herself.

591
00:33:21,027 --> 00:33:22,026
Assistant D.A. Peckham,

592
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:24,195
my client stands behind his testimony.

593
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,398
Know that we are taking
this very seriously.

594
00:33:27,433 --> 00:33:29,901
State your name
for the camera, then proceed.

595
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:31,568
Is that feed being broadcast in any way?

596
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:33,403
Internal use only.

597
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:35,671
My name is Aaron Donner,

598
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:38,108
and I have information
on a secret organization

599
00:33:38,143 --> 00:33:40,143
that operates worldwide.

600
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:41,844
They call themselves Travelers.

601
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,380
A terrorist organization?

602
00:33:43,415 --> 00:33:44,680
Similar, yes,

603
00:33:44,716 --> 00:33:46,383
and they operate outside the law,

604
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:47,583
infiltrate government agencies.

605
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:49,018
Yes, I was informed

606
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:51,053
you even implicated a federal agent.

607
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:53,322
That's a very serious
allegation, Mr. Donner.

608
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:54,723
I was approached by him.

609
00:33:54,758 --> 00:33:56,725
He revealed himself as a double agent.

610
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,894
Said that he was part
of a large network,

611
00:33:58,930 --> 00:33:59,861
and that if I joined them,

612
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:01,229
he could help me with my charges.

613
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:02,731
Help you how?

614
00:34:02,766 --> 00:34:05,233
He just said that he could
help me if I was one of them.

615
00:34:05,268 --> 00:34:07,367
And how is it
that no governmental department

616
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:08,970
is even aware of these Travelers?

617
00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:10,904
Because they operate in secret.

618
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:14,679
Mr. Donner, I'm gonna need
something more concrete

619
00:34:14,715 --> 00:34:16,043
than your conspiracy theories.

620
00:34:16,078 --> 00:34:17,077
We're done here.

621
00:34:17,113 --> 00:34:18,245
He's right there.

622
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,312
Why don't you ask him?

623
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,614
Why don't you ask? Ask him yourself.

624
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,415
Ask him about Travelers. He knows.

625
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,283
Aaron, you're confused.

626
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:25,652
Special Agent MacLaren,

627
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:27,120
if you could please escort Mr. Donner

628
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:28,387
back into federal custody,

629
00:34:28,422 --> 00:34:30,089
where we can process him accordingly?

630
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,490
No, look. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

631
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:33,592
Wait! Wait! I can prove it.

632
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,665
I am one of them.

633
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:41,700
What are you talking about?

634
00:34:42,114 --> 00:34:44,069
I'm Traveler 4022.

635
00:34:44,104 --> 00:34:46,004
I will tell you everything.

636
00:34:46,524 --> 00:34:49,374
How we communicate,
how we receive our orders,

637
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,465
our-our missions, our protocols,

638
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,537
just, please.

639
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:53,979
To finally live in the world
above ground,

640
00:34:54,014 --> 00:34:55,582
I will not give that up.

641
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:58,683
I'll tell you everything.

642
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:02,787
Continue.

643
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:04,454
We communicate on secure servers

644
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,157
in the deep web.

645
00:35:06,192 --> 00:35:07,958
I can show you.

646
00:35:07,994 --> 00:35:09,860
You'll see messages that correspond

647
00:35:09,896 --> 00:35:11,696
with all the missions that we've done...

648
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:12,963
heists, assassinations.

649
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:14,564
The Van Huizen explosion? That was us.

650
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,000
And how can you determine if someone

651
00:35:17,035 --> 00:35:18,935
is one of these Travelers?

652
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,804
We use a com device that's injected

653
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:22,271
just beneath the ear.

654
00:35:22,307 --> 00:35:23,940
That's how we communicate
within our team.

655
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:25,942
And you have one of these devices?

656
00:35:25,977 --> 00:35:27,443
No. I was supposed to get one,

657
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:29,179
but my team was killed shortly
after their arrival, so...

658
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:30,813
Arrival from where?

659
00:35:30,848 --> 00:35:31,814
The future!

660
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:38,386
Please, I am telling the truth here.

661
00:35:38,422 --> 00:35:40,322
I swear. Just check... Check his com.

662
00:35:40,357 --> 00:35:41,323
Just look for yourself.
Look for yourself.

663
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:42,791
Don't.

664
00:35:42,827 --> 00:35:46,333
Agent MacLaren was sent here
to brief me on my first mission.

665
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:49,831
If I go down, you go down too.

666
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:52,499
I wish you hadn't said that.

667
00:35:52,535 --> 00:35:54,869
Is this true, Special Agent MacLaren?

668
00:35:54,904 --> 00:35:57,972
Are you one of these Travelers?

669
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,631
Yes.

670
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:09,116
I'm Traveler 3468.

671
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:19,292
And I'm not alone.

672
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:28,734
Traveler 4022,
you are accused of treason.

673
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,153
Your trial begins now.

674
00:36:38,302 --> 00:36:39,869
Give him five more minutes.

675
00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:40,870
He's already had 30.

676
00:36:40,905 --> 00:36:42,136
I'm not missing dinner with my kids

677
00:36:42,171 --> 00:36:44,119
because the ex-football star
had better things to do.

678
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:45,760
Goodnight, Grace.

679
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:49,377
Dammit, Trevor.

680
00:36:50,647 --> 00:36:52,747
Traveler 4022

681
00:36:52,783 --> 00:36:54,783
failed to defuse the bomb

682
00:36:54,818 --> 00:36:56,918
that led to the death of his team.

683
00:36:56,953 --> 00:36:59,553
I'm sure it was
a very difficult situation

684
00:36:59,588 --> 00:37:00,888
to face alone.

685
00:37:00,923 --> 00:37:02,689
But he wasn't alone.

686
00:37:02,725 --> 00:37:04,291
No.

687
00:37:04,326 --> 00:37:07,360
You offered 4022 your assistance.

688
00:37:07,396 --> 00:37:09,596
Many times, but he was afraid.

689
00:37:09,632 --> 00:37:12,165
And do you think
this excuses his actions?

690
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:16,107
No, I don't.

691
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:21,541
I practiced defusing that bomb
a thousand times...

692
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:25,355
But when I got here, it didn't work.

693
00:37:26,915 --> 00:37:28,548
I swear, I tried it.

694
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,583
The Director didn't give me enough time.

695
00:37:30,618 --> 00:37:32,327
And what was I supposed to do? Die?

696
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:33,850
Instead, you betrayed all of us.

697
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,759
It is now time to vote.

698
00:37:46,633 --> 00:37:49,167
3569.

699
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,202
0115.

700
00:37:56,175 --> 00:37:57,741
3326.

701
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:01,745
What's going to happen to me?

702
00:38:17,072 --> 00:38:18,695
Traveler 4022,

703
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,797
you have been found guilty of treason,

704
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:23,765
for which the punishment
is death by immediate overwrite.

705
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:27,402
No. No! No! No!

706
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:32,641
No! No!

707
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:33,961
No!

708
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,779
No. No!

709
00:39:24,592 --> 00:39:27,560
Traveler 4024...

710
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:29,828
welcome to the 21st century.

711
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:43,708
Thank you.

712
00:39:50,783 --> 00:39:51,982
Yes?

713
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,350
Carly, I was, uh...

714
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,887
passing through the area
and wanted to drop by.

715
00:39:56,922 --> 00:39:59,089
Just for a moment.
I have another appointment.

716
00:39:59,124 --> 00:40:00,857
What's going on? Is something wrong?

717
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:03,560
I just wanted you to know
you're not alone.

718
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:04,928
I'm going to help you.

719
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:06,228
I've seen this system

720
00:40:06,263 --> 00:40:08,363
fail women like you
too many times before,

721
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:10,967
and I'd like to see this story
have a better ending.

722
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:14,112
Okay. Um... Thank you.

723
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:17,539
The father does have a lot of leverage,

724
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:19,931
so in between now
and the next proceeding,

725
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:22,144
we need to strengthen your case.

726
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:25,580
Red flag number one...
your liquid income.

727
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:27,148
I swear to you,
I didn't make that money by...

728
00:40:27,183 --> 00:40:28,449
It doesn't matter.

729
00:40:28,485 --> 00:40:30,384
As far as I care,
you did what you had to

730
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,721
in order to feed your child.

731
00:40:32,756 --> 00:40:35,189
But... the allegation was made,

732
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,325
and so we have to combat it.

733
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,760
How?

734
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,894
You need to get a job.

735
00:40:42,494 --> 00:40:44,075
I'll help you get set up.

736
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:48,068
Let's meet later this week.

737
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:05,251
What's wrong?

738
00:41:05,613 --> 00:41:07,020
Donner got off.

739
00:41:07,055 --> 00:41:08,320
Of the death penalty.

740
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:10,189
He's still gonna get life in prison.

741
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:11,223
With a chance of parole.

742
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:13,359
Not for a long time.

743
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,628
He's just lucky
he killed the right people.

744
00:41:16,664 --> 00:41:17,796
What does that mean?

745
00:41:17,831 --> 00:41:19,277
Nobody cares about the deaths

746
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:21,433
of a few sex workers.

747
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:23,501
Just sweep it underneath the rug.

748
00:41:24,202 --> 00:41:25,904
It's not right.

749
00:41:37,483 --> 00:41:39,150
For Chrissake.

750
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:40,350
We need to talk.

751
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,486
Didn't bring your FBI friend with you?

752
00:41:42,521 --> 00:41:44,975
No. Wasn't necessary.

753
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:48,058
This should cover
all the benefits that I received

754
00:41:48,093 --> 00:41:49,325
under David's care,

755
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,427
with interest.

756
00:41:53,065 --> 00:41:54,064
Is this legal?

757
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:55,031
Do you care?

758
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:57,701
David needs to maintain
his position here.

759
00:41:57,736 --> 00:41:59,202
He's doing a bit of work for us.

760
00:41:59,237 --> 00:42:00,436
That's blackmail.

761
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,239
I could take the money back,
if you prefer,

762
00:42:03,274 --> 00:42:05,607
give it to your replacement.

763
00:42:06,944 --> 00:42:09,178
But David seems to like you.

764
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,984
Tell him he can
come back to work on Monday.

765
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:20,155
Bye, Ken.

766
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:31,999
Hell of a first assignment.

767
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:34,668
Well, honestly, I think
even going to prison's better

768
00:42:34,704 --> 00:42:36,431
than where I just came from.

769
00:42:36,814 --> 00:42:37,905
It's that bad?

770
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:40,707
I was kind of hoping
the work we've been doing

771
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:42,976
would have some effect,
especially Helios.

772
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:44,410
If anything, it's going the other way.

773
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:46,525
Have we at least found
more fuel for the reactor?

774
00:42:47,499 --> 00:42:49,116
I shouldn't have said anything.

775
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,183
Protocol 2.

776
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,417
You know we're not supposed to...

777
00:42:51,453 --> 00:42:52,963
Yeah, no, I get it. I get it.

778
00:42:55,057 --> 00:42:56,247
Be strong.

779
00:43:26,286 --> 00:43:28,219
Rough jump into the 21st?

780
00:43:31,924 --> 00:43:34,158
I'm Traveler 2587.

781
00:43:35,694 --> 00:43:38,207
So, you're one of The Director's
abandoned orphans too?

782
00:43:38,243 --> 00:43:40,730
I'm on mission,
and you're breaking Protocol 2.

783
00:43:40,766 --> 00:43:43,100
Some mission.

784
00:43:44,336 --> 00:43:46,969
I trust in the grand plan.

785
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:48,475
Give it some time.

786
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:51,310
Then we'll talk.

787
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:06,818
