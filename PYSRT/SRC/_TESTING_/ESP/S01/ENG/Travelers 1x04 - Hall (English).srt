1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:02,000
Previously on Travelers...

2
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:04,069
We're off mission. Stand down!

3
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,269
No plan survives contact with the past.

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:07,872
You must be new.

5
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,908
We just got this security-camera footage

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,176
from outside the library.

7
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,777
Has Marcy been acting
differently lately?

8
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:18,082
No.

9
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:20,383
How are you supposed to throw
a football with a broken hand?

10
00:00:20,385 --> 00:00:21,384
Please stop.

11
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:23,153
What is wrong with him?

12
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:24,955
Whoa, Philip.

13
00:00:24,957 --> 00:00:25,956
And all these people are going to die?

14
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:26,957
Yeah.

15
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:28,726
I know this person.

16
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:39,102
I'm starting to think
whoever they're buying from

17
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:41,337
ain't gonna show.

18
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:43,610
It's all about patience.

19
00:00:44,893 --> 00:00:46,582
That's what you said
with the Jonas Walker case,

20
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:49,533
and he fell off the face of the Earth.

21
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,572
You're going to have to
let that one go, partner.

22
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:54,341
Yeah, I know, I know.

23
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:56,642
I'm like a dog with a bone, I guess.

24
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:59,079
Hello.

25
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:21,467
What are they selling, car parts?

26
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:23,501
Looks good.

27
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:34,379
That's a hell of a lot of money
for car parts.

28
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,188
Multiple shots fired! 65 Heward Drive.

29
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,773
We need back-up right away!

30
00:01:52,464 --> 00:01:54,231
- What about the back-up?
- Can't wait!

31
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:00,036
FBI!

32
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,203
Drop your weapons!

33
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,040
No! Drop your weapons!

34
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,308
All responding units, be advised,

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,977
there's a damaged Mercedes
leaving this location

36
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,579
with three armed men,
two of them badly injured.

37
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:12,981
Intercept and detain if possible!

38
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,553
Traveler...

39
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,755
34... 68.

40
00:02:20,757 --> 00:02:23,058
Support required.

41
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,127
Coordinates 47 degrees, 14 minutes,

42
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,729
35.045 seconds.

43
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,330
Make and model confirmed.

44
00:02:30,332 --> 00:02:31,398
Units are en route.

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,033
...07 seconds.

46
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,069
End of message.

47
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:40,040
You wait for the back-up.

48
00:02:40,042 --> 00:02:41,603
I'm going after them!

49
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,778
It's a damn mess.

51
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,601
Philip, you there?

52
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:10,726
Hey, boss.

53
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:11,736
What are you doing right now?

54
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:13,405
Oh, you know...

55
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:15,607
healing from a gunshot wound,

56
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,542
watching old news with Marcy.

57
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,244
I need you to direct me

58
00:03:19,808 --> 00:03:22,279
to 47 degrees, 14 minutes,

59
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:25,255
35.045 seconds

60
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:26,750
by 122 degrees,

61
00:03:26,752 --> 00:03:30,221
22 minutes, 13.407 seconds.

62
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:31,922
- You got it?
- On it.

63
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:33,724
Why? What... What's happening?

64
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:35,292
I just got the most bizarre messenger.

65
00:03:35,294 --> 00:03:37,361
They're all bizarre to me.

66
00:03:37,363 --> 00:03:39,162
Yeah, well, this message
came from the mouth

67
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:41,131
of a dying man...
a traveler team in need

68
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,632
of assistance at those coordinates.

69
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,100
It's on its way to you now.

70
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,294
We'll meet you there.

71
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:47,237
Uh, nope, Philip's not
going anywhere in his shape,

72
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:48,605
but I will be there in 10.

73
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,673
Pick up Carly on the way. Come armed.

74
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:52,507
Bring your full medical kit.

75
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,721
You're at the coordinates.

76
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,525
Should be an old warehouse on your left.

77
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,693
How far out are Carly and Marcy?

78
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:13,027
Uh, five minutes.

79
00:04:13,528 --> 00:04:15,296
Make sure they wait for my all-clear.

80
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,698
Understood.

81
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,459
Drop your weapon.

82
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:26,162
- I'm here to help.
- Shut up.

83
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:27,523
He's one of the FBI agents.

84
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:28,898
Yeah. Who you shot at.

85
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,066
Thanks very much.

86
00:05:30,068 --> 00:05:31,640
Whatever happened to Protocol 3?

87
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:35,495
I'm Traveler 3468.

88
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:37,540
I received a message
to come to these coordinates

89
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,174
and give support.

90
00:05:39,176 --> 00:05:40,443
Who delivered the message?

91
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:41,810
One of the Russians.

92
00:05:41,812 --> 00:05:43,279
Well, that's bullshit,

93
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:44,459
'cause that would...
that would kill an adult.

94
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:45,459
It did.

95
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,316
The Director must've figured
he was dying anyway.

96
00:05:49,422 --> 00:05:50,686
You want my help or not?

97
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,389
I'm Rick Hall.

98
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:55,823
This is Carter. That's my boy,
Luca, on the table.

99
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:57,425
Grant MacLaren. My medic's on the way.

100
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,910
Well, that's good, 'cause ours is dead.

101
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:01,189
What is this? What happened?

102
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,297
Well, our mission

103
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:04,566
was to acquire a component
from Russian travelers

104
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,401
and deliver it
to another team for testing.

105
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:07,835
The Russians' historian was dead,

106
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:09,337
so they were out of cash.

107
00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:11,538
We were then instructed to finance them

108
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,340
in exchange for the hand-off,

109
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:14,675
but they got greedy.

110
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:16,443
A traveler team turned on you?

111
00:06:16,445 --> 00:06:17,844
He must be new.

112
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:20,681
Yeah. They went rogue.

113
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,215
Tried to take our money
and the component,

114
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:25,352
probably sell it somewhere else,
and busted it in the process.

115
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,303
You saw the rest. Now where's the medic?

116
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,323
Carly, Marcy... you have the all-clear

117
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:32,825
to enter the building upon arrival.

118
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:33,826
One minute out.

119
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:34,894
They're moments away.

120
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,696
So how badly damaged is it?

121
00:06:36,698 --> 00:06:38,931
I don't know. It's not my expertise.

122
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,669
It was a good plan, if the Russians
hadn't gone rogue.

123
00:06:42,671 --> 00:06:44,504
Yeah, then the FBI would've busted you.

124
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:45,837
Doesn't sound like a great plan to me.

125
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,311
Oh, shit.

126
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:57,316
We're coming in.

127
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:00,531
It's all right.

128
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:01,899
What can you tell me?

129
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:04,386
Gunshot wound to the abdomen.
There's no exit wound.

130
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:06,281
This is Luca. That's Carter. I'm Hall.

131
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:07,966
Mr. Hall is their team leader.

132
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:09,422
You can put your weapon away now.

133
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:17,180
He's lost a lot of blood
and still hemorrhaging.

134
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:18,400
I think the only thing I can do

135
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:19,608
is get him stable before
we get him to a hospital.

136
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,516
No. No hospitals.
He's wanted by the police.

137
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:22,403
They both are.

138
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,483
Well, I don't have anywhere
near the proper resources.

139
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,007
Well, obviously,
the Director thinks you do,

140
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:27,421
or you wouldn't be here, would you?

141
00:07:31,192 --> 00:07:33,910
All right. Go ahead and put him out.

142
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,296
Can you get me light, please?

143
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,738
All right, all right.

144
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:49,441
Okay, warm up the laser
and get him on plasma.

145
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:53,751
What happened?

146
00:07:54,611 --> 00:07:55,749
He got shot in the gut.

147
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:56,990
No. I'm talking about you.

148
00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:58,321
Let me see.

149
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:02,720
Ah! Goddammit!

150
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:04,934
I don't think that you understand

151
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:06,490
how serious your injuries are.

152
00:08:06,492 --> 00:08:09,526
Stop worrying about me and help Luca.

153
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:18,807
It's Forbes.

154
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:20,301
Do your thing.

155
00:08:20,748 --> 00:08:21,804
MacLaren.

156
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:23,406
We've got three dead bodies.

157
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:25,241
All of them ghosts in the system.

158
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,276
Really? Any word on the whereabouts

159
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:28,477
of that car that I was pursuing?

160
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,245
That's what I'm calling to ask you.

161
00:08:30,247 --> 00:08:31,747
No, no. They had too big a lead.

162
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:34,383
I was just about to get back
to local enforcement.

163
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:36,315
All right, let me know what you hear.

164
00:08:36,597 --> 00:08:37,753
Will do.

165
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:39,655
I can't locate the bullet.

166
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:41,018
I think the only thing that I can do

167
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,249
is cauterize the torn vessels...

168
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,236
Just get the bullet out of him.

169
00:08:43,238 --> 00:08:44,125
I am telling you

170
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:46,560
that if I operate now, I will kill him.

171
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:56,904
Your friend, Carter,
is coughing up blood

172
00:08:56,906 --> 00:08:59,573
because his internal bleeding
includes his lungs.

173
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,942
I'm telling you that he's dying,
he can't be saved.

174
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:04,627
The man is an ox! He just carried...

175
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,614
Shut up and listen to me! Okay?
This is time-sensitive.

176
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,949
Luca has lost close to 40% of his blood.

177
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:12,885
He won't survive any sort
of surgery without a donor.

178
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,287
So if we act now,

179
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:16,589
we can use Carter's blood
to save Luca's life.

180
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,924
I have a blood-type converter,

181
00:09:19,645 --> 00:09:21,660
I'm telling you I can't save them both.

182
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,297
So we either watch the two of them die,

183
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:28,367
or Carter saves Luca's life...
those are your options.

184
00:09:30,684 --> 00:09:32,504
You need to decide
before Carter goes septic

185
00:09:32,506 --> 00:09:33,905
and his blood's not good to anyone.

186
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:42,380
- Mr. Hall...
- I Hear you! Relax.

187
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:44,882
Just give me a second, please.

188
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:59,396
I have to make sure
the FBI doesn't show up here.

189
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:01,365
Now, look, if I don't do
something to throw Forbes off...

190
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:02,399
Do what you need to do.

191
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,802
I'll be operating into the early hours.

192
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,826
Carly can assist.

193
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:10,391
Mr. Hall can handle
anything that comes up.

194
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:18,692
All right.

195
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,106
Looking good, Trev. How's that feel?

196
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:47,408
Oh, it feels great.

197
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:48,409
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

198
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:50,611
Let's see what you got in the tank!

199
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:56,884
Wow.

200
00:10:56,886 --> 00:10:58,973
Man, you're flying!

201
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,720
You'll be back on the team in no time.

202
00:11:00,722 --> 00:11:01,821
Trevor?

203
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:03,088
Can I talk to you?

204
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,892
Ms. Day? How can I help you?

205
00:11:06,526 --> 00:11:08,494
Actually, I would like to help you.

206
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:10,797
I've been looking over your transcripts

207
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,733
and there are some things
we need to talk about.

208
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,200
What is it?

209
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:17,451
Well, it's kind of a bigger conversation

210
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:19,103
that I'd like to have
with you and your parents.

211
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:20,939
You know, the whole team.

212
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,073
I like to think

213
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:23,708
that I can have these
conversations on my own.

214
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:27,979
Well, you're 17, so.

215
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:29,748
I've set a meeting with them

216
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,844
for fourth period today.

217
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:33,518
I'll expect to see you there.

218
00:11:34,163 --> 00:11:35,586
I'll be there.

219
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:36,720
All right.

220
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:39,089
Hey! A little help?

221
00:11:42,317 --> 00:11:43,677
Let's see if you've still got it!

222
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:10,926
What are you doing here?

223
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:12,888
No "Hey, Jeff." No "Good morning."

224
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,923
I get "What are you doing here?"

225
00:12:15,406 --> 00:12:17,759
Looks like my son spent
another night at the babysitter's

226
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:20,061
while you were out
with your new man, hmm?

227
00:12:20,653 --> 00:12:21,797
You think I haven't seen
that white dude around?

228
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,064
Is that how you got these new wheels?

229
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,065
You got a sugar daddy?

230
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,867
That's none of your business.

231
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:27,677
Carly.

232
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:28,736
We gotta talk about this family.

233
00:12:28,738 --> 00:12:29,904
We're not a family.

234
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:32,607
Mother, father, and son.

235
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:36,492
Mother, son, abusive biological father.

236
00:12:37,305 --> 00:12:39,198
- That's cold.
- It's accurate.

237
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,131
So you're gonna throw away
everything that's good between us

238
00:12:41,156 --> 00:12:43,322
because one night
I had a bit too much to drink?

239
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:45,270
I'm leaving now.

240
00:12:45,272 --> 00:12:46,771
Oh, Carly, come on.

241
00:12:46,773 --> 00:12:48,973
Come on. You know
we got a connection, right?

242
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,533
You gonna tell me you don't miss this?

243
00:12:50,558 --> 00:12:52,158
- Don't, Jeff.
- I do.

244
00:12:54,814 --> 00:12:57,716
Ho, ho, ho... ow!

245
00:12:57,718 --> 00:13:00,851
Oh...

246
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:05,008
This...

247
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,076
is where any idea you have of "us"

248
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,477
ends.

249
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,879
Right now.

250
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,948
You do not touch me.

251
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,580
Are we clear?

252
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:17,253
I still got a right to see my kid.

253
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:19,696
And your kid has
a right to child support.

254
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:21,086
Don't come near us again without it.

255
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,987
You've changed, Carly. You're like...

256
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:26,739
You're like a completely
different person.

257
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:30,498
That's something that should've happened
a long time ago.

258
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:33,835
Bitch.

259
00:13:35,217 --> 00:13:36,216
Bitch!

260
00:13:45,907 --> 00:13:47,607
Hey, kid?

261
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:48,640
Hey.

262
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:50,942
Got your drugs.

263
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:52,849
Why don't you knock next time?

264
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,196
Why don't you lock the door?

265
00:13:55,221 --> 00:13:56,804
You're welcome, by the way.

266
00:13:56,806 --> 00:13:57,716
If you're smart,

267
00:13:57,718 --> 00:13:59,319
there's about three weeks' worth
of Percocet there.

268
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:00,518
Although, you know, uh,

269
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:03,688
trading one addiction
for another never works.

270
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,858
Uh, you look, uh... not so good.

271
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,561
Like somebody beat you up.
Did somebody beat you up?

272
00:14:13,523 --> 00:14:14,709
I'm fine.

273
00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,734
You don't look fine.
You look like a piece of...

274
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:18,274
Holy shit.

275
00:14:20,979 --> 00:14:22,878
What is this?

276
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:24,446
It's nothing.

277
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:27,062
It's insanity.

278
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:31,819
Hey. It's the gambling matrix, right?

279
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:33,421
This is how you do it, isn't it?

280
00:14:33,423 --> 00:14:34,856
It's really nothing.

281
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:38,593
There are dates up here
that are months from now.

282
00:14:38,595 --> 00:14:40,086
How much research do y...?

283
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:42,631
No! Don't...! Don't.

284
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,067
Why don't you give me a tip?

285
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:49,656
Gimme a little tip. Come on.

286
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:52,439
Can you just leave?

287
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:53,644
Please?

288
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,843
Either you give me a tip,

289
00:14:56,845 --> 00:14:58,303
or you tell me what this is all about

290
00:14:58,305 --> 00:14:59,545
on the wall over here,

291
00:14:59,547 --> 00:15:01,014
all right?

292
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:02,581
'Cause you got all of that,

293
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,583
and you're giving me, like, crumbs.

294
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,220
Come on, man.

295
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:09,255
You'd be in jail right now
if it wasn't for me.

296
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:11,190
You know that.

297
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:48,158
Hey, Luca, it's okay!
Hey, I'm right here.

298
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,392
I'm right here.

299
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:50,726
I need you to wake up
and listen to me, Luca.

300
00:15:50,728 --> 00:15:52,228
I need you to wake up,
all right? Wake up, Luca.

301
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,363
- Luca?
- No.

302
00:15:53,365 --> 00:15:54,364
Luca, wake up.

303
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:59,069
Agh!

304
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:00,670
Get it out!

305
00:16:00,672 --> 00:16:02,338
No! No!

306
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,973
Get it off me! Get it out of me!

307
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:05,674
Wake up! Luca! Wake up!

308
00:16:14,258 --> 00:16:15,891
Ms. Warton.

309
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:18,259
I'm Officer Conniker.
I tried to contact you earlier.

310
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:20,308
I'd just like to speak with you

311
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:22,365
about the incident outside the library.

312
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:23,958
What incident?

313
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,660
The boys that assaulted
you and another employee?

314
00:16:28,162 --> 00:16:30,398
Listen, I understand
that you didn't report it,

315
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,932
and that's not unusual
with assault cases,

316
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:35,503
but I... I saw the closed circuit
television footage.

317
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:37,271
Caught both assaults
and you kicking their asses.

318
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:40,240
Not that you'd be in
any trouble for retaliating.

319
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:43,210
What I saw was actually damn impressive.

320
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:45,011
Well, I'd like to move on.

321
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:46,279
Uh-huh. Listen.

322
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:49,043
Have you sought counseling of any kind?

323
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:51,718
Everything's fine.
I don't need counseling.

324
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,653
So then why are you living
with this social worker?

325
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:55,122
Excuse me?

326
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:57,089
Not that you're to blame in any way,

327
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:58,457
but I should inform you

328
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:00,326
that should a state mental health worker

329
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:01,427
be found guilty

330
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:03,229
of inappropriate fraternization
with a client,

331
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,364
especially one with
developmental issues...

332
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:07,500
Do I look like I have
developmental issues, officer?

333
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:09,435
That's not for me to judge.

334
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,438
I'm just saying that'd be
grounds for termination,

335
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,172
if not worse... litigation.

336
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:18,409
Just so you understand the consequences.

337
00:17:20,046 --> 00:17:21,312
You gonna take that, or...?

338
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:23,615
Uh, yeah. If you'll excuse me.

339
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:25,650
This is Marcy.

340
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:34,324
What happened?

341
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,326
He was fine when I left.

342
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:37,461
Night terrors.

343
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:40,764
Sometimes they're too real.

344
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:42,232
Yeah, one minute he's sleeping,

345
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:43,400
and the next, he's screaming.

346
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:44,401
He almost killed me once.

347
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:52,508
All right, well,
let's get you closed up again.

348
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,433
Mac. We got 'em.

349
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:05,086
Got who?

350
00:18:05,088 --> 00:18:06,354
Our friends from last night.

351
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:08,356
Located 'em right here in town.

352
00:18:08,358 --> 00:18:11,059
We had leads
that had them leaving the city.

353
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:13,261
Yeah, I did some digging anyway.

354
00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,706
Ran the plates
on the car that left the scene.

355
00:18:15,731 --> 00:18:17,699
It belongs to a Sergeant Rick Hall.

356
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:19,177
Served in Iraq,

357
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:20,335
lives in Portland.

358
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:22,670
Had some agents go check out
his place this morning.

359
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:25,339
Hall hasn't been there in weeks.

360
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:26,773
Pulled him up on the database.

361
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,175
He owns three other properties.

362
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:31,412
Place in Austin, condo in Vancouver,

363
00:18:31,414 --> 00:18:33,780
and a warehouse right here in town.

364
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:38,085
Checked out the freeway CCTV footage...

365
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:40,306
And...

366
00:18:40,655 --> 00:18:42,255
Nice work.

367
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:45,358
Let's file for a warrant
and get down there, huh?

368
00:18:45,704 --> 00:18:47,126
Already got it.

369
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:49,000
Suit up.

370
00:18:49,484 --> 00:18:51,317
Right! I'll meet you downstairs
in a minute.

371
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:52,632
All right.

372
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:56,368
Marcy, it's MacLaren.

373
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,307
I don't know.

374
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:06,278
I just got word from MacLaren.

375
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,546
The FBI are on their way.

376
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,414
We have maybe 20 minutes.

377
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,116
Isn't MacLaren with the FBI?

378
00:19:11,118 --> 00:19:13,117
Yeah, and he obfuscated
the best he could,

379
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,219
but his partner found your name
on the deed to this building

380
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,487
and tracked your vehicle here.

381
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,656
Okay, well, you... you tell him

382
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,090
he's got to stop them.

383
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,127
There's only so much he can do
without blowing his cover.

384
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,562
We're wasting time!

385
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:25,796
Are you being serious right now?
Are you kidding me?

386
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,231
What about us?

387
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:28,332
Luca shouldn't even be moved!

388
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,733
I will be there!

389
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,435
I'm okay. We should go.

390
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:33,436
They're on their way.

391
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,138
We need to move.

392
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,876
What I'd like to do

393
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,645
is change the conversation

394
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,580
from Trevor's football career

395
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,448
and focus on his grades.

396
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,583
If he has a football career,
he doesn't need grades.

397
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:50,252
Tabling that a moment,

398
00:19:50,254 --> 00:19:51,787
I think it's important
for you to understand

399
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:54,189
that Trevor needs
to start doing much better...

400
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:55,691
- ...if he hopes to graduate.
- Trevor, we need you...

401
00:19:55,693 --> 00:19:56,992
...outside the school and ready to go

402
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:58,193
in three minutes. We've got a mission.

403
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,695
...Are you prepared to do the work?

404
00:19:59,697 --> 00:20:00,696
I can do that.

405
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,030
Good.

406
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:03,498
Carly will be outside to pick you up.

407
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,667
...Time on his homework
and less watching Internet porn.

408
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,669
Understood, no more porn.

409
00:20:07,671 --> 00:20:08,670
What?

410
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:10,070
Don't embarrass the kid.

411
00:20:10,072 --> 00:20:11,472
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree, Gary.

412
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:13,574
Ms. Day? I know you probably have

413
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:15,443
a lot you want to talk about
without me in the room,

414
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:17,478
so I should give you
a chance to do that.

415
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,746
All I have to say

416
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:20,580
is that I fully intend
to raise my grades

417
00:20:20,582 --> 00:20:21,948
and focus on the sciences,

418
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,583
and I have no intention
of playing football again.

419
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:25,352
- What?
- Sorry, Gary.

420
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:26,420
"Gary"?

421
00:20:26,422 --> 00:20:27,754
Thank you for your time and concern.

422
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:29,323
But Trevor, we're not finished here.

423
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:31,880
- Trevor!
- You're playing football!

424
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:35,028
I'm sorry.

425
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,496
He's just been so different
since the concussion.

426
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:41,187
Can I have one of those?

427
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:45,571
Do you think you can sit up for me?

428
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,408
All right. There you go.

429
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,031
Okay.

430
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:54,646
I need you to hold
this bag above your heart, okay?

431
00:20:58,251 --> 00:20:59,741
Is that Carter?

432
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:02,920
He saved your life.

433
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:06,958
Above your heart, okay?

434
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:09,927
Nice and easy!

435
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:11,695
The wound is fragile.

436
00:21:11,697 --> 00:21:14,732
All right. It's time. We gotta go.

437
00:21:15,236 --> 00:21:16,933
Okay.

438
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:29,846
Reminder... these men are dangerous.

439
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:31,981
Approach with extreme caution.

440
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:35,150
Breathe, man.

441
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:36,819
You used to love this shit
in the old days.

442
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:39,789
I wasn't very bright in the old days.

443
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,859
Fall back! Fall back!

444
00:22:20,796 --> 00:22:23,029
You okay?

445
00:22:34,197 --> 00:22:35,652
You should warn us.

446
00:22:35,677 --> 00:22:37,011
Hey, come on. You would've told him.

447
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:38,078
MacLaren had to be as surprised
as the rest of them.

448
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,346
Don't worry about it. They're fine.

449
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:40,047
They could've been hurt.

450
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,315
It had to be done!

451
00:22:41,317 --> 00:22:42,116
We would've left too much back there

452
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:43,227
that might've incriminated...

453
00:22:43,248 --> 00:22:45,321
Jesus, what is that? Is that a baby?

454
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,716
- Whose baby is that?
- Mine.

455
00:22:49,718 --> 00:22:52,294
- You take him on missions?
- Oh, not if I can help it,

456
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:54,136
but somebody needed
to come save your ass.

457
00:22:57,097 --> 00:22:58,897
He has your eyes, Carly.

458
00:22:59,832 --> 00:23:00,866
He really does.

459
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:14,845
I just hope we can fix it.
It's a key component.

460
00:23:14,847 --> 00:23:16,547
Tell me this kid knows what he's doing.

461
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:18,748
This kid is older
than all of us put together.

462
00:23:19,819 --> 00:23:21,218
What the hell was that?

463
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,952
You nearly killed my men!

464
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:24,220
They're not your men.

465
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:26,735
Do you even give a damn
about Protocol 3?

466
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,824
Was anybody killed?

467
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:29,058
You nearly killed me!

468
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,494
Yet here you are, MacLaren!

469
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:31,728
Look, if you'd done your job properly,

470
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,826
the FBI wouldn't have
found us in the first place.

471
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:35,928
I can only throw them off
the scent for so long!

472
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,098
Forbes is a good cop.

473
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,368
Well, maybe I should've waited

474
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,169
for your friend, Forbes,
to open the door

475
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:41,170
before I set it off.

476
00:23:41,172 --> 00:23:42,171
What?

477
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:43,906
It was our base of operations!

478
00:23:43,908 --> 00:23:45,341
I had to get rid of the evidence!

479
00:23:45,343 --> 00:23:47,009
You almost got...

480
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,210
Okay! Okay, okay.

481
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:53,516
It's done.

482
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:55,224
You're alive.

483
00:23:55,407 --> 00:23:56,418
Yeah.

484
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,166
Have you slept? You look exhausted.

485
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:07,503
I am, but I'll live, so will my patient.

486
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:10,719
- It's not an easy fix.
- But we can do it.

487
00:24:10,744 --> 00:24:11,718
Well, you damn well better.

488
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:13,442
Don't talk to my team like that!

489
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:14,743
Or what? What're you gonna do?

490
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:16,177
Okay! All right!

491
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:17,512
All right! Hey!

492
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,187
They just need some time to work.

493
00:24:27,423 --> 00:24:30,125
Let's give them some space.

494
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:38,632
What is it?

495
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:40,634
I'm grounded.

496
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,839
You know,
I was tempted to break his nose

497
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:47,174
on your behalf,

498
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:49,142
but I held it together.

499
00:24:49,144 --> 00:24:50,576
You and me both.

500
00:24:50,578 --> 00:24:51,744
I don't know.

501
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:53,046
The Director obviously thinks

502
00:24:53,048 --> 00:24:55,077
he and his team are worth saving, but...

503
00:24:56,151 --> 00:24:57,684
I gotta get back to work.

504
00:24:57,686 --> 00:25:00,486
This bomb isn't exactly gonna
De-escalate the investigation.

505
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:02,655
I gotta call my babysitter.

506
00:25:17,604 --> 00:25:20,538
Hey. Can I get on our computer?

507
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,472
Uh...

508
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:23,774
Is there something you need?

509
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:24,998
I'll do it, just get me on.

510
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:28,879
I need to set the drop-off coordinates

511
00:25:28,881 --> 00:25:30,733
with the other team,
if that's okay with you.

512
00:25:35,021 --> 00:25:36,286
I guess.

513
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:38,189
Well, thank you so much.

514
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:06,788
How are you feeling, Luca?

515
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:09,662
Better.

516
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:12,420
Thanks.

517
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:17,024
Hey, uh, how long
have you had night terrors?

518
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:20,461
Since I was a kid.

519
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:23,497
I know it's hard for
some people to understand.

520
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,625
No. I do.

521
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:29,203
My brother used to get them
all the time, growing up.

522
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:30,303
Your brother?

523
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:31,404
Mm-hmm.

524
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:36,509
Uh, get some rest, okay?

525
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:39,479
Yeah.

526
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:52,811
Hey.

527
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:55,727
Can I talk to you for a second?

528
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:57,362
About what?

529
00:26:57,364 --> 00:26:58,764
When I was really young,

530
00:26:58,766 --> 00:27:00,299
there was an emergency evacuation

531
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:01,733
in my shelter block.

532
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:03,402
I was separated from my brother...

533
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:04,803
So?

534
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:08,506
So... one of the things
that I remember about him

535
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:10,441
is he used to suffer from night terrors.

536
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:11,475
I just thought,

537
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:12,844
there's only so many of us...

538
00:27:12,846 --> 00:27:14,012
Leave the future in the past, Doctor.

539
00:27:14,014 --> 00:27:15,013
Protocol 2.

540
00:27:15,015 --> 00:27:16,281
I understand that,

541
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:17,481
but if it's at all possible...

542
00:27:17,483 --> 00:27:18,716
I don't think you understand.

543
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:20,418
I don't think you
understand a goddamn thing.

544
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,685
I don't think any of you do!

545
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:24,521
Look.

546
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:26,389
We came here with a team of five,

547
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:27,490
just like you.

548
00:27:27,492 --> 00:27:29,392
You know, we all made it,

549
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,628
which is rarer than you think,
believe it or not,

550
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,463
but we're down to two now.

551
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,466
What does that mean to you?

552
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:38,600
Uh... two more to go?

553
00:27:40,538 --> 00:27:42,972
When you have been doing this
as long as we have,

554
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:44,773
doing whatever the Director
tells you, without question...

555
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:47,476
building devices for missions,
rigging elections,

556
00:27:47,478 --> 00:27:49,312
saving people...

557
00:27:49,314 --> 00:27:51,881
and by the way, killing people, too...

558
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:54,916
don't think the future
doesn't get its hands dirty.

559
00:27:56,553 --> 00:28:00,055
To do this job, to stay alive,

560
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:02,423
you need to be focused.

561
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:03,959
We're very focused, Mr. Hall.

562
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,793
Focused?

563
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:07,729
You're a bunch of tourists!

564
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:09,297
He's a junkie!

565
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,466
Don't think I haven't seen
fresh track marks before.

566
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:13,800
You're worried about
your parents grounding you,

567
00:28:13,802 --> 00:28:15,336
for Christ's sake!

568
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:18,472
Your tactician brings an infant
to the missions, and MacLaren...

569
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,407
Hah! MacLaren doesn't even know
what side he's on!

570
00:28:20,409 --> 00:28:21,948
Well, I thought we were all
supposed to be on the same side.

571
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:24,979
I need you to be
committed to the mission,

572
00:28:24,981 --> 00:28:26,680
whatever the mission!

573
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:28,849
Protocol 1 is the only one that matters,

574
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:30,449
and that's what you guys aren't getting!

575
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:32,172
And the reason you're not getting that

576
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:35,989
because your priorities
are all outta whack!

577
00:28:36,649 --> 00:28:39,359
Now I need this team,
right here, right now,

578
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:40,760
to get on side,

579
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:42,428
or I cannot trust you.

580
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:45,031
Is there a problem?

581
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:46,899
- No!
- Yes!

582
00:28:46,901 --> 00:28:48,000
Mr. Hall here doesn't seem to think

583
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:49,334
that we know what we're doing.

584
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:50,936
I am just trying
to help your people understand

585
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,371
how things are around here.

586
00:28:52,373 --> 00:28:54,472
Oh, we understand how it is, Mr. Hall.

587
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:57,542
We really do.

588
00:28:57,544 --> 00:28:59,378
I hope so.

589
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,312
Knock-knock?

590
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:24,447
Kat.

591
00:29:26,184 --> 00:29:27,783
You really are here.

592
00:29:27,785 --> 00:29:29,685
Yeah, I-I texted you.

593
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,387
Yes, you did.

594
00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:33,255
How romantic.

595
00:29:33,257 --> 00:29:35,291
Since this is usually date night,

596
00:29:35,293 --> 00:29:36,464
I thought I'd bring you some Chinese

597
00:29:36,466 --> 00:29:38,193
and make you take a break.

598
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:39,594
Don't worry, it's vegetarian.

599
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:41,162
Well, that is romantic.

600
00:29:41,164 --> 00:29:42,230
Mm.

601
00:29:42,232 --> 00:29:43,465
I'm sorry about tonight.

602
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:45,500
I-I know it's been crazy busy.

603
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:47,052
I just... we don't have enough manpower.

604
00:29:47,054 --> 00:29:50,105
Oh, come on, I am happy to
share you with your work, babe.

605
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:51,454
I always have been.

606
00:29:52,142 --> 00:29:54,376
As long as that's all
I'm competing with.

607
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:56,895
What does that mean?

608
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:02,149
Well, it has been an awfully long time.

609
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,222
Yeah, I know.

610
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,099
Hey.

611
00:30:20,101 --> 00:30:21,100
Hey.

612
00:30:21,102 --> 00:30:22,535
You still look like shit.

613
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:24,403
Thanks.

614
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,505
Who's that you're with?

615
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:27,372
A friend.

616
00:30:27,374 --> 00:30:28,540
Kinda looks like a cop car.

617
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:30,675
Yeah, it does a little, doesn't it?

618
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:32,277
So which one is it?

619
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,446
Right here.

620
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:39,784
That's great. Thanks for doing this.

621
00:30:39,786 --> 00:30:41,520
Yeah.

622
00:30:41,522 --> 00:30:42,521
Keys?

623
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:43,522
Oh...

624
00:30:43,524 --> 00:30:45,256
Where's my money?

625
00:30:45,258 --> 00:30:46,624
I transferred your money.

626
00:30:46,626 --> 00:30:47,924
Yeah, you transferred me the rent,

627
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,760
now you owe me 8% commission.

628
00:30:49,762 --> 00:30:52,229
8% what?

629
00:30:52,231 --> 00:30:54,698
And, uh, bets for tomorrow.

630
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,334
I gave you bets yesterday.

631
00:30:57,336 --> 00:30:59,703
Yeah, but I got a little ambitious.

632
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:01,538
I can't keep doing this, Ray.

633
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,572
You know what?

634
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:03,839
I can't keep being your errand boy.

635
00:31:03,841 --> 00:31:05,841
Come on, bud. Show me a little respect.

636
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:07,843
Look at everything I do for you
on a daily basis.

637
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:09,912
I bring you drugs.

638
00:31:09,914 --> 00:31:11,281
I show you houses.

639
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:14,284
You don't even tell me your system.

640
00:31:14,286 --> 00:31:16,286
Okay, 10%.

641
00:31:17,722 --> 00:31:19,754
10%. What's that work out to?

642
00:31:19,756 --> 00:31:21,390
Give me the keys.

643
00:31:21,392 --> 00:31:23,392
Who's this house for, anyway?

644
00:31:23,394 --> 00:31:25,694
It's a safe house for time travelers.

645
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,762
Them again, huh?

646
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,932
All right. It's better I don't know.

647
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:33,935
Here you go.

648
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:36,571
Did your host have a family?

649
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:38,806
Sort of. Not really.

650
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:41,642
She had, um... David.

651
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:43,244
His name is David.

652
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:46,280
He took care of my host
before I arrived.

653
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:48,216
What? Like a butler?

654
00:31:48,218 --> 00:31:49,817
Your host rich?

655
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:53,653
No, she just needed
assistance with some things.

656
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:56,489
What about you?

657
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:58,558
Wife? Kids?

658
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:15,674
That should do it.

659
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:16,675
Looks different.

660
00:32:16,677 --> 00:32:17,710
It'll work.

661
00:32:18,912 --> 00:32:21,547
Hall, we found you a safe house.
It's time to go.

662
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:23,549
Don't let the door
hit your ass on the way out?

663
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:24,717
What happened

664
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:25,751
to "we're all on the same side"?

665
00:32:25,753 --> 00:32:27,418
I don't wanna be in the same room.

666
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,753
Listen, we're all gonna get along.

667
00:32:28,755 --> 00:32:29,754
You'll see.

668
00:32:29,756 --> 00:32:30,821
Where's Luca and Marcy?

669
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:31,989
They went for a walk.

670
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,991
Marcy said that he had to keep moving

671
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,293
to prevent clotting.

672
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:37,362
Okay. Soon as they get back.

673
00:32:37,364 --> 00:32:39,631
Are you sure that's
the Director's intention?

674
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:41,499
'Cause I'm just...
I'm just asking a question.

675
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,533
Have you received instructions
from the Director

676
00:32:43,535 --> 00:32:44,534
to relocate my team?

677
00:32:44,536 --> 00:32:46,270
No, I haven't.

678
00:32:46,272 --> 00:32:47,704
Okay, well, the Director
put us together for a reason.

679
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:48,838
You're splitting us up, why?

680
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,839
Protocol 6.

681
00:32:49,841 --> 00:32:51,207
Oh, listen

682
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:52,676
to the boy scout quoting his protocols.

683
00:32:52,678 --> 00:32:54,478
I know the rules, MacLaren.

684
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,280
"Traveler teams should stay apart

685
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:57,648
unless instructed otherwise."

686
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,449
Well, guess what?
You were instructed otherwise.

687
00:33:00,451 --> 00:33:02,918
I think you know
that I have seniority here.

688
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,354
I should be leading this team.

689
00:33:11,896 --> 00:33:13,729
MacLaren.

690
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:15,831
We I.D.'d all the bodies now.

691
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,266
Counting the Russians

692
00:33:17,268 --> 00:33:18,466
and the guy we found scorched
in the warehouse,

693
00:33:18,468 --> 00:33:19,701
that's four.

694
00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:21,436
That leaves two still out there.

695
00:33:21,438 --> 00:33:22,937
Well, one of them's
this "Rick Hall" character.

696
00:33:22,939 --> 00:33:24,572
Who's the other one?

697
00:33:24,574 --> 00:33:25,973
Ah, the system just pulled him up

698
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:27,442
on an ABM camera in the East End.

699
00:33:27,444 --> 00:33:29,511
I'll send a picture to your phone.

700
00:33:29,513 --> 00:33:31,713
Guy's name is Luca Shun.

701
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:35,716
We got him working 15 years
as a sous chef in Portland,

702
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:37,685
then all of a sudden,
he's wanted upstate

703
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:39,753
for petty theft and assault charges.

704
00:33:39,755 --> 00:33:41,555
I'm following a lead on Hall.

705
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:42,656
I'll let you know what I find.

706
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:43,691
All right.

707
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:45,693
Agent Forbes?

708
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:47,828
I told you he was a good cop.

709
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,996
Marcy, I need you and Luca inside now.

710
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,498
Marcy?

711
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,033
She may have turned off her com.

712
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:55,034
- I'll try and find them.
- Yeah, I'll look around...

713
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:56,402
- ...The neighborhood.
- You stay put.

714
00:33:56,404 --> 00:33:57,737
- You're just as wanted as Luca.
- Hey. We're right here.

715
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,038
Hey.

716
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,340
What's wrong?

717
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:02,342
The FBI caught you on CCTV,

718
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:03,909
knows who you are,
and are searching the area.

719
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,812
Yeah, if only we had
somebody on the inside.

720
00:34:05,814 --> 00:34:08,480
There is no way I'm risking

721
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:09,981
my team getting discovered.
I want you out of here.

722
00:34:09,983 --> 00:34:12,050
The mission comes first.

723
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:13,084
You said it was a simple hand-off

724
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:14,085
of a component,

725
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:15,086
so hand it off,

726
00:34:15,088 --> 00:34:16,621
and get out of state.

727
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:18,423
You know, there's a simple
answer to this problem.

728
00:34:21,462 --> 00:34:22,861
He needs to go.

729
00:34:22,863 --> 00:34:24,929
- Who needs to go?
- Go where?

730
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:27,030
Forbes! He knows too much.
He's too close.

731
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,766
We remove him,
we don't got to go anywhere.

732
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:30,468
We are not killing Forbes.

733
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,502
Well, if you can't to do it,

734
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:32,603
I know people who can,

735
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:33,771
but it's obvious to me

736
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:35,439
the Director's
put us together for a reason...

737
00:34:35,441 --> 00:34:37,107
so I can teach you a lesson.

738
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,978
Now, if it's too much for you to handle,

739
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,145
I can help you, but I think
it would be better for all of us

740
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:44,981
to see if you have it in you.

741
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,453
So...

742
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:52,989
Do we... Do we have a problem?

743
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:54,991
No.

744
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:57,427
Do you deny my seniority?

745
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,628
I don't deny it.

746
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,996
Of course not.

747
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:03,665
You're the kind of man
who follows the rules.

748
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:04,666
This is great, right?

749
00:35:04,668 --> 00:35:06,034
Luca and I can handle

750
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:07,469
our drop-off tonight
while you deal with Forbes.

751
00:35:07,471 --> 00:35:09,170
I'm gonna take your vehicle.

752
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:11,039
- I'll rent you a car.
- Whatever.

753
00:35:11,041 --> 00:35:12,474
As long as you remember

754
00:35:12,476 --> 00:35:13,942
to bring it back
with a full tank of gas.

755
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:15,878
Cracks me up. I love this guy.
Here's the thing.

756
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,044
When we're both done,

757
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:18,646
we are gonna have a conversation

758
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:21,682
about how this new team
will work together.

759
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,352
Forbes.

760
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,321
Hey, it's Mac.

761
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:49,554
You got something?

762
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:50,822
Yeah, maybe.

763
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:51,904
We should meet.

764
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:54,159
I'll text you the location
and the broad strokes,

765
00:35:54,161 --> 00:35:55,960
but we should go over
the details in person.

766
00:35:55,962 --> 00:35:57,095
Say an hour?

767
00:35:57,675 --> 00:36:00,032
Yeah, I can do that. You all right?

768
00:36:01,101 --> 00:36:02,536
Never better.

769
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:04,869
See you in an hour.

770
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,169
We're all set.

771
00:36:47,244 --> 00:36:50,345
Nobody said this was gonna be easy.

772
00:36:50,347 --> 00:36:52,013
I know,

773
00:36:52,015 --> 00:36:55,417
but I never thought we'd have to
do something like this.

774
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:59,287
Just think of how MacLaren feels.

775
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:01,122
He's the one who has to do it.

776
00:37:01,124 --> 00:37:03,491
He doesn't have to do anything.

777
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:06,927
The Director didn't order it.

778
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:36,622
How confident are you in the Intel?

779
00:37:36,624 --> 00:37:38,991
This is the place.

780
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,910
Your new doctor
thinks she's your sister.

781
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,649
Yeah. She told me.

782
00:38:33,029 --> 00:38:34,618
I hope she's right.

783
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,085
Well you should get that thought

784
00:38:36,087 --> 00:38:37,454
out of your head right now.

785
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:39,655
Your loyalty needs to be with me.

786
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:41,479
You know you have it.

787
00:38:44,538 --> 00:38:45,537
I'm not so sure of MacLaren.

788
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,472
Oh, don't worry about MacLaren.

789
00:38:47,474 --> 00:38:50,074
I know what kind of guy he is.
He'll fall in line.

790
00:38:51,211 --> 00:38:52,377
And if he doesn't?

791
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:54,912
Then he'll have to go.

792
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:28,278
FBI!

793
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,179
Hands! Show me your hands!

794
00:39:31,582 --> 00:39:34,149
Son of a bitch.

795
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:37,653
Get out.

796
00:39:39,056 --> 00:39:40,989
Sergeant Richard Hall,

797
00:39:40,991 --> 00:39:42,123
you have the right to remain silent.

798
00:39:42,125 --> 00:39:43,458
Anything you say

799
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,260
can and will be used against you
in the court of law.

800
00:39:45,262 --> 00:39:46,995
You have the right to an attorney.

801
00:39:46,997 --> 00:39:49,129
If you cannot afford one...

802
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,070
Search the car.

803
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,973
The aisles are clear.

804
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,102
Sorry for the change in location.

805
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:08,034
What happened to the other team?

806
00:41:08,036 --> 00:41:09,341
They apparently had complications.

807
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,065
We were instructed to take over.

808
00:41:12,477 --> 00:41:13,643
Here it is.

809
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,144
It was damaged,

810
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:17,094
but we did our best to repair it.

811
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:18,414
As long as it works.

812
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:20,215
Helios isn't far away.

813
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:30,091
Wasn't anything in the car.

814
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:31,159
No?

815
00:41:31,161 --> 00:41:32,160
That's cool.

816
00:41:32,162 --> 00:41:33,528
We got plenty on 'em to put them away.

817
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,191
Just makes me wonder...

818
00:41:36,846 --> 00:41:38,132
What were they doing out here?

819
00:41:38,134 --> 00:41:40,802
How about I ask them in the morning?

820
00:41:40,804 --> 00:41:43,104
That works for me. Great work, partner.

821
00:41:43,106 --> 00:41:44,539
You too.

822
00:42:25,245 --> 00:42:26,678
Hey, guys.

823
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,946
I know it's late,

824
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:32,128
I just wanted to touch base
about what we did tonight.

825
00:42:37,157 --> 00:42:38,756
The last thing I ever thought I'd do

826
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:41,299
is turn on a fellow traveler...

827
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:45,162
but I really don't think
we had any other choice.

828
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:51,902
I guess we'll find out soon enough

829
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:54,537
if the Director agrees.

830
00:42:57,776 --> 00:42:59,542
Anyway...

831
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:02,459
I just wanted to say
thanks for sticking by me.

832
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:05,147
Get some rest.

833
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,220
Can you stay?

834
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,771
I shouldn't.

835
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:21,923
Okay.

836
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,633
Tell me we did the right thing.

837
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:27,936
I believe we did.

838
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:31,217
But I guess we'll see.

839
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,741
Yeah.

840
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:35,777
We'll see.

841
00:43:58,534 --> 00:44:06,706
