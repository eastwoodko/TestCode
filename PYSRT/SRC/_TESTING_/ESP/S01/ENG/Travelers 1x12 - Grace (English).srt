1
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:14,890
Agent MacLaren never did
explain before they left how my...

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,768
teapot got smashed.
I don't suppose you...

3
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,771
Yeah. Doesn't matter.

4
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,731
I just dipped the bags in the cups.

5
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:23,982
Careful, that's hot.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,151
What is this?

7
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,445
Really?

8
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,699
Wow. It's, uh... It's tea.

9
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:34,743
He said you wouldn't remember the events
of the last few months, but I...

10
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:36,369
didn't expect that.

11
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,376
It's good. I like it.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,462
Yeah, I know you do.

13
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,923
Blow on it, though, so you don't...

14
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,216
burn your tongue.

15
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,929
So this experimental procedure
that they gave you...

16
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,014
uh, what was that all about?

17
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,392
-Did it hurt?
-I... I can't tell you that.

18
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,604
Because you don't remember.

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,981
I don't, actually,

20
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,066
but that's not why I can't tell you.

21
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,276
Because it's a secret.

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,486
That part you remember.

23
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,406
All right, you know, it doesn't matter.
It worked.

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,201
And to be honest, Marcy, I'm just...

25
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,996
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

26
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:21,331
Why can't you tell me?

27
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,960
Oh...

28
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,461
Well, I can.

29
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,215
What did MacLaren tell you about me?

30
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,093
Uh, everything.

31
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,930
That you knew me on a professional level
while I was undercover,

32
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,433
but that we were friends now.
I've been staying here temporarily.

33
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,019
And that's it?

34
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:46,439
There wasn't really that much time
to brief me before you came home.

35
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,025
Yeah. No. I just...

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,779
Yeah.

37
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,241
He said the most important thing
was that we were close.

38
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,994
And that I can trust you.

39
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,333
When I was in college,

40
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:08,586
I learned all about amnesia
in one of my courses.

41
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,051
I don't remember which course,
ironically...

42
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,263
but I do remember learning
that in a lot of cases,

43
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:19,765
memories come back.

44
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,604
That's what I'm hoping for.

45
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,319
Charlotte, what's wrong?
Did you have a bad dream?

46
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,078
It's all right. Your mom's here.

47
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,165
Charlotte?

48
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,968
Charlotte?
Is everything all right in there?

49
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,344
No.

50
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:42,765
You should come in.

51
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,999
What are you doing here?

52
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,293
Hi. Thought we could, uh...

53
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,673
work out together, and then...
go somewhere for breakfast.

54
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,717
No, Grant. I mean,
what are you doing here?

55
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,263
What do you mean? I wanted to see you.
What's wrong with that?

56
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:28,435
I'm not doing this here.

57
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,062
Doing what?

58
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,355
Step off that thing for a second.
Come on, let's... let's talk.

59
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,441
Oh, now you want to talk?

60
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,276
What happened?
Did she break it off?

61
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,653
-What? Who?
-Don't insult me.

62
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,989
What's her name?

63
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,826
You want to do this here? Fine.

64
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,203
What's her name, Grant?

65
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,413
You want to talk,
let's start the conversation with that.

66
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,542
How did you know?

67
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:03,511
I didn't, really, not for sure,
but I guess I do now.

68
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,138
Kat, I...

69
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:08,308
If you want to know when,
it was the last time we had sex,

70
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,143
after your surprise party.

71
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,896
At the time, all I could think of was,

72
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,816
"Wow, where the hell
did he learn how to do that?"

73
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:19,486
Then afterwards, I realized
there was obviously only one explanation.

74
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,365
It was like you were making love
to a different person.

75
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,950
You were a different person.

76
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,702
-How do you think that made me feel?
-In a way, I was.

77
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,414
All I can tell you is that I'm here now.

78
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,917
And I wanna stay.

79
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,213
I'm not sure I want you to.

80
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,522
David?

81
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,648
Yes?

82
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,027
-Oh... hey.
-What are these from?

83
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,780
Uh... what am I looking at?

84
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,823
These scars on my chest and my neck.

85
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,117
These wounds are fresh,

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,701
and it looks like
it was done by a scalpel.

87
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,245
Right. Yeah.

88
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,247
You, uh...

89
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,749
You performed minor surgery on yourself,

90
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:18,921
installed something called
a vagus nerve stimulator,

91
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,672
supposed to help
with the seizures you were having.

92
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,549
Uh, by myself?

93
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,967
Why would I do that?

94
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,843
Yeah. That's what I said.

95
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:31,516
VNS therapy would have never worked
in the case of pre-existing damage.

96
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,519
Yeah, that's what you said.
Right after.

97
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,354
I was apoplectic.

98
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,565
There was blood everywhere.

99
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,567
Obviously, I took it out.

100
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,069
The only thing that seemed to help,

101
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,988
or at least bought you time,
was the, uh...

102
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,323
lumbar punctures.

103
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,286
You made some sort of serum
out of the fluid.

104
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,788
I couldn't have done that by myself.

105
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,082
You didn't.

106
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,875
I helped.

107
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,046
Do you mind if I have some coffee
before we continue this conversation?

108
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,923
Do you have any medical training?

109
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,259
Nope. You taught me.

110
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,636
Do you remember coffee? Do you...

111
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,180
Do you want some coffee?

112
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,435
If those treatments
really did buy me time, then...

113
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,147
I owe you my life.

114
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,316
No. You don't owe me anything.

115
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,987
You could do me a favor, though.
You could... You could...

116
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,616
You could do up one or...
two of those buttons

117
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,701
on that shirt that I laid out
for today, which, that...

118
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,869
I mean, that's fine.

119
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,871
Is it bothering you?

120
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,457
Bother's the wrong word.

121
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,542
Better?

122
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,754
I don't know.

123
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,095
David... were we intimate?

124
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,058
See, the thing about that is...

125
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,019
you'd only have my word to go by,

126
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,479
which forces my inner boy scout
to not take advantage.

127
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,160
If that was a test, that wasn't fair,
'cause I wasn't ready.

128
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,079
That was to thank you for helping me.

129
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,375
I thought maybe you remembered something.

130
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,754
Oh, there... there is one thing.

131
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,464
What? What is it?

132
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,841
That you're a reporter.

133
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,099
A social worker.

134
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,312
- But that's okay.
- We'll work on it.

135
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,778
I'm here.

136
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,030
Hey, it's me.

137
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,656
- I need your help.
- What is it?

138
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,949
It's Jeff. He's...

139
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,368
I've left you messages about this.

140
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,412
He's got me backed into a corner.

141
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,913
He wants custody of my son.

142
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,208
-Your son?
-Yes.

143
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,335
What do you want me
to do about it?

144
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,627
Talk to him. With...

145
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,422
with your position at the FBI,
you can... You can help--

146
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,175
I spoke to Jeff, Carly.
Or rather, he spoke to me.

147
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,926
-At work.
-He did?

148
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,011
God, I want to bury that man.

149
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:16,181
You need to get this situation
under control.

150
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,390
That's why I need your help.

151
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,976
Does Trevor call me every time
he's got trouble with his parents?

152
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,145
No, but you don't sleep with Trevor,
do you?

153
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:29,277
Fight your own battles, Carly,
just like the rest of us.

154
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,242
And then Rene said that all my pictures

155
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,286
should have
hashtag, boob job won't fix this on them.

156
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,497
So... you didn't retaliate?

157
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,290
What?

158
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,043
This is your problem exactly.
You let people walk all over you.

159
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,962
You need to establish dominance.

160
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,882
Next time Rene says something to you,
disparage her home life.

161
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,717
Her mother's had a DUI.

162
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,470
Alternatively,
you can just accept the fact

163
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,264
that you're less attractive
and uninteresting.

164
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,849
That option may even be more realistic.

165
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,108
Uh... I'm gonna go...

166
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,401
Good talk.

167
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,660
Um, Ms. Day, can I talk to you
for a minute?

168
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,995
Let's not pretend I have a choice.
What is it?

169
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:24,081
Um, I have some forms for a field trip
I need your signature on.

170
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,375
Shouldn't your parents fill those out?

171
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,544
They're dead.

172
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,753
What?

173
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,798
Jesus.

174
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,111
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

175
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,657
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!
Hey! What are you doing?

176
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,913
- She tried to kill me!
- I can tell!

177
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,917
Let me go!
I'm on a mission!

178
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,260
- Go after her!
- And do what? She's a kid!

179
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,804
-A kid who tried to stab me to death!
-Why? What'd you do?

180
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,889
What did I do?
There's something more going on here.

181
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,934
-What?
-I can't stay here. She'll be back.

182
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,644
-I have to get to Ellis.
-No, no!

183
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,271
You're not going anywhere just yet.

184
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,398
Guys, it's Trevor.
We have to meet up at ops.

185
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,359
A traveler just tried to kill Grace.

186
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,033
Sorry.
I had a hard time finding the place.

187
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,410
I should have picked you up.

188
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,662
It's fine. I'm here now.

189
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,831
Not a single SOS that I can see.

190
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,251
Maybe she was just targeting you.

191
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,460
Of course she was targeting me.

192
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,045
Are you sure it wasn't just a student
with a bone to pick?

193
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,506
No, I was there.

194
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,467
You remember the family
who had their historian misfire?

195
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,010
I'm pretty sure it was the daughter.

196
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,721
The girl I took to her grandma's house?

197
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:03,723
Don't look at me.

198
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:04,891
Charlotte.

199
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,184
She said she was on a mission.

200
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,396
She was taken as a host anyway.

201
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,148
Why would the director want you dead?

202
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,941
The director didn't send her.

203
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,985
I've already told you,
there's a faction in the future--

204
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,071
No one but the director
has the capability to send travelers.

205
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,240
Tell them what you did.

206
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,076
Tell them! Or I will.

207
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,249
I reset the director.

208
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,334
What?

209
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:34,462
Rebooted its OS through a virus

210
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,507
in order to protect it
from corruption by the faction.

211
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,635
What would they say in the 21st? Uh...

212
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,346
"Control, alt, delete."

213
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,264
That's impossible.

214
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,601
Well, the director is a highly advanced
quantum AI program

215
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:51,938
and I'm the lead programmer,
so, no, not impossible.

216
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,650
You reset an AI that's been running
every facet of our lives

217
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,111
since long before I was born,
and not to mention every mission--

218
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,613
Before you were born, maybe.

219
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,240
But not me.
I helped create it.

220
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,284
-No one else could've done it.
-How?

221
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,372
She uploaded a command
while pretending to save Marcy's life.

222
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,291
How?

223
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,129
When she saw my code,
it was sent back as visual information

224
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,550
through the quantum bridge created
during transfer of consciousness.

225
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,344
You mean you used me?

226
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,555
I saved you,
and I'm saving the director.

227
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,641
Where is the gratitude?
What is wrong with you people?

228
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,352
What's happening in the future
while it's offline?

229
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,269
Chaos, probably.

230
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,939
A temporary power struggle.

231
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,361
The faction doesn't believe
in the grand plan.

232
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:42,739
Even before Helios had basically
no effect on the future,

233
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,116
they had already started a mission
to abandon ship.

234
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,202
Your team knows firsthand
the brutality they're capable of.

235
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:51,414
You mean they're the ones
who put us in those cages?

236
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,375
Tortured us?

237
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,668
To test your loyalty...
and to make sure

238
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,587
you couldn't complete a mission
they disagreed with.

239
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,298
That was the first real proof I had

240
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,135
that they'd managed to implement
some of their agenda.

241
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,347
So I came back here
into the 21st to stop them.

242
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,809
What do we do now?

243
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,604
The director will come back online
more secure than ever,

244
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,981
and soon,
everything will go back to normal.

245
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,734
"Thank you for saving us, Grace."

246
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,411
Please take me to Ellis...

247
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,163
before one of you gets overwritten
and tries to kill me.

248
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,081
What makes you think you'll be safe there?

249
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,083
He's taken precautions.

250
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,211
Boss?

251
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,633
Yeah, get her outta here.

252
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,053
But don't let her out of your sight.

253
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,439
"Thank you for saving us, Grace!"

254
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,915
Is this yours?

255
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,753
Uh...

256
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,421
Yeah.

257
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,216
I inherited it from my host.

258
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,511
Historical record was wrong.

259
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,472
You know, we should spend
some more time debriefing you.

260
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:13,973
-There are a lot of--
-What?

261
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,476
You just kept taking it?

262
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,979
You were helping me wean off it,
but I had a little bit of a setback.

263
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,815
Well, we're starting again.
No more than eight units.

264
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,151
If you take more than that,
it's because you want it.

265
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,360
And I won't stand for that.

266
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,195
And from now on...

267
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,322
I'm keeping track of how much you dose.

268
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:32,950
You're the doctor.

269
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,244
And you're the historian.

270
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,996
We need your mind clear.

271
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,971
Ellis!

272
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,516
Ellis!

273
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,355
Ellis!

274
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,692
Ellis!

275
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,278
- Where is he?
- Not here.

276
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:24,251
So you are gonna be hanging
with the babysitter today.

277
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,377
Huh?

278
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,472
Just gonna hang tight, little man,

279
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,726
and I'll come back and get you
after work, okay?

280
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,935
Hmm?

281
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,689
You wanna fly?
You wanna fly?

282
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,398
Hey, it's okay.

283
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,442
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

284
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,111
Hey, guys.

285
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,484
You okay?

286
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,487
Are you...

287
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,407
- okay?
- I'm fine.

288
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,870
I had no choice.
She was gonna shoot you.

289
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,040
-Yeah, she was.
-You saw that, right?

290
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,752
Carly, what the fuck are you doin'?

291
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,921
Carly! You need to stay put!

292
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,255
Carly!

293
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,548
Carly!

294
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,286
Where the hell were you?
It's dangerous out there!

295
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,664
I had to run out for a few supplies.

296
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,341
What do you want now?

297
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,635
The faction sent
an assassin after me.

298
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,179
Not a very good one, apparently.

299
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,765
Oh, fortunately,
I was there to stop her.

300
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,101
-Where?
-At the school.

301
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,853
Any of 'em follow you?

302
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,230
We're alone.
You can stop worrying about yourself.

303
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,319
Were you a part of the reset, too?

304
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,238
-Reset?
-Of the director?

305
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,574
-That is too far.
-It was the only way.

306
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,159
Not by a long shot!

307
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,411
My God, the ego of this woman.

308
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,623
When?

309
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,584
When I sat Marcy down at your computer.

310
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:12,669
Right in front of me.

311
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,966
-Give me a hand with this.
-What is all this?

312
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,723
Are these SQUID transistors?

313
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,601
You think you're the only one
who figured out what the faction is up to?

314
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,061
Look, have a little faith.

315
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,522
The director had its own contingency,

316
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,690
although you've probably screwed
that all up.

317
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:34,984
Wait, what contingency?

318
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,821
Me... and this.

319
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,087
I was sent back to assemble this.

320
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,769
The director's had teams working
on core elements for months.

321
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,147
First components arrived
the day I came back to the 21st.

322
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,858
-This is a quantum frame.
-Yes, it is.

323
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,778
If things get bad enough
that the director has no choice

324
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,531
but to escape the faction,
it can send itself here to the 21st.

325
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,922
Agent MacLaren.

326
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,507
Officer Boyd.
How can I help...

327
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,927
Jesus, what are you doing?

328
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,678
-What'd you do?
-What?

329
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,389
What did you do that would make
the director give an order to kill you?

330
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,433
How did you receive the order?

331
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,560
By messenger.
Don't change the subject.

332
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,728
What did you do?

333
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,647
I think you already know
I didn't do anything wrong,

334
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,608
or we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

335
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,693
Your orders didn't come from the director.

336
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,238
-What does that mean?
-What was the message exactly?

337
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,407
"Kill 3468," so not a lot of room
for interpretation.

338
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,953
Another traveler I know had an attempt
made on her life earlier today.

339
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,412
By who, if not the director?

340
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,207
According to her,
another faction from the future.

341
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,876
I don't know about any faction.

342
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,293
Well, neither do I...

343
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,545
but apparently,
things have changed since we left,

344
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,839
and not for the better.

345
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,049
That's not good enough.

346
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,550
It's all I got.

347
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,677
I only know what she told me.

348
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:26,803
That's a problem.

349
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,185
It doesn't have to be.

350
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,438
-Does it?
-Yeah.

351
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:38,232
It does.

352
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,028
Take a step back.

353
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,864
Take a step back, MacLaren!

354
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,576
- Hello?
- Hey, Marce.

355
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,493
David?

356
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,163
I'm glad you recognize my voice.

357
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,290
So here's something awkward...

358
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,750
There's a man in my apartment
who's looking for you,

359
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,336
and he has a gun.

360
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,421
Has he hurt you?

361
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,173
Uh... little bit.

362
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:48,052
A little bit,
but he said he'd do a lot more

363
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,096
if I didn't phone you right away.

364
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:51,930
He did point the gun nozzle...

365
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,478
You know, I know it's not "nozzle,"
but I can't think of the word right now.

366
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,063
I wanna say barrel?

367
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,274
You know, it's not coming to me,

368
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,942
but he's got it pointed
at the back of my head

369
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,611
right now, so if you can imagine that...

370
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,406
that's what's happening,
and that's why I'm calling you.

371
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,741
Against my will.

372
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,128
Kat.

373
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,337
Grant? What are you doing here?

374
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,381
Sorry to just show up like this,
but it's important.

375
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,384
-How did you find me?
-I'm FBI.

376
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,012
And I need you to go home right now,
pack a bag,

377
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,929
go to your mother's for a few days,
maybe a week.

378
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,265
What? What's going on?

379
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,475
-I'm dealing with a situation at work.
-Work?

380
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,935
-It's not safe.
-Tell me what's happening.

381
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,687
-I can't.
-Are you safe?

382
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:43,399
Look, I know it's not
the ideal time for me

383
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,236
to make demands of you,
but I need you to do as I ask.

384
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,321
If something happened to you
because of me...

385
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,782
I don't know what I'd do.

386
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,535
-You're serious.
-Yes.

387
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,538
All right, don't worry about me.
I'll go right now.

388
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,665
Just tell me that
you're gonna be all right.

389
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,252
I'll walk you to your car.

390
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,587
Come on.

391
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,092
Carly, where the hell are you?

392
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,593
I am in some serious shit.

393
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,012
I need you to meet me down at the station
and help me.

394
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,973
You were the only witness

395
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:20,018
that saw that I killed that girl
to save you!

396
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,897
You just can't run off
to leave me to deal with this!

397
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,400
Call me back.

398
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,312
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

399
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,147
-I'm here about your east wall.
-What?

400
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:06,815
The building manager notified you, yes?

401
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,610
I just need your cooperation
for a couple minutes, okay?

402
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,528
-Building manager?
-Yeah. He should have contacted you.

403
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,863
I just need you to step aside
for a moment,

404
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,407
and I will be
out of your way soon, okay?

405
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,719
Hello?

406
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:47,231
Answer it.

407
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,862
-Hey, Marce?
-Duck.

408
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,989
-What?
-Duck down now.

409
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,375
Oh, God.

410
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,963
Oh, God.

411
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,052
Marce?

412
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:20,055
Marcy? You shot him.

413
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,350
What did you expect me to do?
He was gonna kill you right after me.

414
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,478
I need you to go somewhere else
for a couple nights, until it's safe.

415
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,021
Okay?

416
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,065
Go somewhere?

417
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,610
Marcy, there's a dead guy
on my living room floor!

418
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,572
I gotta call the police.

419
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,325
If you insist on bringing them
into this...

420
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:42,035
I need you to tell them that
you don't know where the shot came from.

421
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,331
-You want me to lie?
-No, David.

422
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,998
I want you to go somewhere safe,

423
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,793
but if you're gonna bring the police
into this then, yes, lie.

424
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,755
We'll have to cover this up later.

425
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,216
I need to go.

426
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:57,593
Marcy?

427
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,767
Hello. You've reached
the confidential voicemail

428
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:07,228
of Special Agent Forbes.

429
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:09,938
Please leave a detailed message,
and I'll get back to you.

430
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:14,235
Hey, Walt, it's Kat again.

431
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,363
I'm sorry to keep calling,
but I really need to talk to you.

432
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,823
What's going on?
I'm worried.

433
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,325
Please call me back.

434
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,288
It'll be a tight fit, all right.

435
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,999
Do you even have a plan
for when this is all ready?

436
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,418
I figured I'd flip the switch
and see what happens.

437
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,295
- You would.
- No, this one here.

438
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,505
Plan for what?

439
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,841
For when the director is ready
to send itself here.

440
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,637
As of right now,

441
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,641
this entire farm is protected by
a space-time attenuator field.

442
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,851
Covers the whole farm
in a 100-yard radius.

443
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,311
Nothing will penetrate it.

444
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:52,147
No electronics, no GPS,
no telemetry of any kind

445
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,649
in the 21st or the future.

446
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:56,277
So we're invisible
to the faction right now.

447
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,403
And to the director.

448
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,281
It won't be able to send a messenger
or consciousness here,

449
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,573
let alone itself.

450
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:04,075
As soon as we know the director's
back online, we'll be safe

451
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,202
and we can turn off the defenses.

452
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,914
Then it can either come back to the 21st

453
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,582
or stay where it is.

454
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,334
Either way...

455
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,545
I'll have to feed the pigs
and milk the cow in the morning.

456
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,384
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would the director want

457
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,510
other teams to take each other out?

458
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,136
Maybe Grace was right.
Maybe it's the faction.

459
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,972
Or maybe we're being punished
for helping her.

460
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,601
Sorry, boss, nothing.

461
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,645
No other teams reporting
that they've encountered this.

462
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,730
Everything looks normal on the deep web.

463
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:36,483
Well, there's nothing to report
if you don't survive.

464
00:29:37,526 --> 00:29:39,820
Trevor, come in.

465
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,029
Trevor?

466
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,157
He could be in danger.
We have to warn him.

467
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,498
Get down!

468
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,797
Go, go, go!

469
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,866
Why are you looking at me like that?

470
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,035
Nothing. No, I'm not.

471
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,914
Don't tell me you had a thing for her.

472
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,166
- Who?
- Who do you think?

473
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,170
Ew, don't tell me that's why
you took her out into the woods.

474
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,340
Grace Day was a lovely human being.

475
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,468
She didn't deserve to die,
that's all it was.

476
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,220
I'd prefer if you'd refer to me
in the present tense.

477
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,141
You know, if you're gonna
go on pretending to be her,

478
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,559
you've got a lot of work to do.

479
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,852
Look who's talking.

480
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,061
What's that supposed to mean?

481
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,980
Your school record says your previous self

482
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,816
was a recalcitrant bully
whose only redeeming quality

483
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,152
was a gift
for something called... football.

484
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,488
Trevor Holden wouldn't have
given Grace the time of day--

485
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:05,864
She didn't deserve to die.

486
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,074
Oh, but Trevor Holden did?
Is that what you're saying?

487
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,951
Existence should be based on merit?

488
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,621
You're a hypocrite.

489
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:18,251
How's our progress?

490
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,337
I need to check in with my team.

491
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,350
Just get to the farm.
We'll be right behind you.

492
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,978
-Oh, no.
-What is it?

493
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,814
I left Poppy behind.

494
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,566
-Who's Poppy?
-My turtle.

495
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:42,943
You mean it belonged to your host?

496
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,236
No, I just bought it as a pet.

497
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:47,489
You know, for company.

498
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,825
A turtle.

499
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,285
Yeah. That was a lot of gunfire.

500
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,120
What if she got shot?
You think she's gonna be okay?

501
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,414
I do.

502
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,253
You're a little different.

503
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,130
It's weird.

504
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,632
Than what?

505
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,134
The Marcy I know.

506
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,011
Knew.

507
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,347
I don't even know if that's possible.

508
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:18,311
I'm not saying
that you're not you.

509
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,646
Obviously, you're you.

510
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,607
How... how am I different?

511
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:26,945
If I had to sum it up into one word,
I would say that Marcy 1.0...

512
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,614
was more fragile.

513
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:35,411
Maybe because you knew
you were gonna die.

514
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,247
You don't have the same burden.

515
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,917
You don't think it's a burden
coming into a team who already knows you,

516
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,377
but you don't know them?

517
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,463
I mean, other than the time
that you trained together.

518
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:47,048
-I'm sure it is.
-It's me, Philip.

519
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,343
Just give me some time to catch up.

520
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,770
Mr. Mailer,

521
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,147
I've got someone coming
to escort you to the station

522
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,774
so we can talk further
while the investigation--

523
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,817
I told you,
the shot came outta nowhere.

524
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,945
Well, not nowhere.
It came from your neighbor's apartment.

525
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,655
We're gonna take a statement
from your neighbor.

526
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,448
Maybe she saw someone.

527
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:15,160
-I don't have anything more to add that--
-You've been under duress.

528
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,913
We're gonna give you
some time to think.

529
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,498
Seriously, I'm fine.

530
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:22,125
Sir, a man was shot in the head
in your apartment,

531
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,835
and you're obviously
holding back information,

532
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,212
including the nature
of your two cell phone calls

533
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,173
prior to your calling 911.

534
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,553
Head on downstairs, please.

535
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:46,107
Something wrong?

536
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,319
Stop the car.
I need to do something.

537
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,119
What?

538
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,130
We gotta stop doing this.

539
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:16,221
-Doing what?
-All of it. Any of it. I can't...

540
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,812
We're fooling ourselves thinking
that we could bring to the 21st

541
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,105
what should have been left behind.

542
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,273
I mean, Protocol 2--

543
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,151
"Leave the future in the past."
But we both decided--

544
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,528
We can't make exceptions

545
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:35,365
because it's convenient, or personal.

546
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,078
I mean, this relationship...

547
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,831
we've been holding on to all this time,

548
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:46,334
it's jeopardizing our team,
our covers, our mission.

549
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,711
And the mission comes first, right?

550
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,005
You know it does.

551
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,341
Look, I just... I think we're better off--

552
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,467
I get it.

553
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,138
-You've got your life you gotta make work.
-I said I get it.

554
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,890
You don't have to say any more.

555
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,063
Drive.

556
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,033
Stop! Stop what you're doing!

557
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,868
- Stop what?
- Look at this.

558
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,161
Look at this.

559
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,039
Mission abort?

560
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,041
The director must be back online.

561
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,502
That message could've come
from your girlfriend for all we know.

562
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,129
She doesn't call me 0115.

563
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,757
Well, then it must be the faction.
They're on to what we're doing.

564
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,718
Or the director knows what you did

565
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,635
and communicated to me
the only way it could.

566
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,304
You jumped into the 21st illegally.

567
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,514
You took a host that wasn't meant for you.
You uploaded a virus--

568
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,184
-All for the greater good.
-According to who? You?

569
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,394
Listen, I told you that I had evidence

570
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:30,230
that an attack on the director
was imminent.

571
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,522
I had no choice but to act.

572
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,566
Well, all I can tell you is...

573
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,152
my mission didn't come to me as a text.

574
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,113
It came from the director, personally.

575
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,742
-Before the reset.
-What?

576
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,744
You received that mission
from the director

577
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,746
before I was able to send the reset.

578
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:46,830
Obviously.

579
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,915
I got here before you did.
What difference does it make?

580
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:52,753
It was still vulnerable to corruption
by the faction at that time.

581
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,545
You two can argue all you want.

582
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,923
I got my mission,
and I'm seeing it through.

583
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,843
Then I'm just gonna have to stop you.

584
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:02,678
Trevor...

585
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,890
Trevor, just...

586
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,183
- Hey!
- Whoa, guys!

587
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,019
Good luck with that.

588
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,157
They're not in the house.

589
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,908
Okay. Well, let's have a look around.

590
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,452
Trevor!

591
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:27,078
In the barn, guys!

592
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,261
What's going on, Trev?

593
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,180
Oh, we were just having a conversation.

594
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,431
At gunpoint?

595
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,892
You're not going to shoot anyone, Ellis.
Put the gun down.

596
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,770
I've got a mission to get done,
and this young man objects.

597
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:53,814
Were you given a mission
to assassinate Trevor?

598
00:37:54,815 --> 00:37:57,067
What? Where the hell did that come from?

599
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,443
His mission was to build this.

600
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,070
What is this?

601
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,697
Has to be a quantum frame.

602
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,783
The director wanted a fail-safe

603
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,868
in the event it had to come back
to the 21st.

604
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,830
And I just received a mission
from the director to destroy it.

605
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,664
-By messenger?
-Text.

606
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,584
I went out of the range
of the attenuation field

607
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,211
to report in,
and this message showed up.

608
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,546
Bah! That could be sent by anybody.

609
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,048
It is pretty unorthodox.

610
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,092
Or it was the only way
the director could communicate.

611
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,384
There's no kids within miles.

612
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:26,930
That message could have just as easily
come from the faction.

613
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,474
Or the faction gave you
the order to build the quantum frame

614
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,851
for their own purposes.

615
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:31,977
Well, both can't be true.

616
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,644
Let's figure it out, 'cause so far today,

617
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,564
every member of my team
has been targeted by assassins.

618
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,399
More proof that the faction
is behind this.

619
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,985
That's not how the director does things.

620
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,153
Unless the director sent the assassins
because we helped you.

621
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,865
How can the faction possibly
send messages to the 21st

622
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:46,282
without the director knowing about it?

623
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:50,078
The director was offline for a short time
after I sent the reset command.

624
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,163
Or the faction
has its own transfer system.

625
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:55,291
There were rumors they were trying
to build one of their own in Shelter 41.

626
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,668
Shelter 41 collapsed when I was a kid.

627
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,130
This is something you remember?

628
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,132
We all remember.

629
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,634
It was a structural flaw.
The weight of the ice was too much.

630
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,719
So we're setting aside Protocol 2 now?

631
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:10,306
It collapsed at exactly 0600
as the reveille bell rang.

632
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,267
Thousands of people died.

633
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,894
It was horrible.

634
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:18,064
Well, now, the people
of Shelter 41 are very much alive

635
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,109
and the founders of an underground
movement against the director,

636
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,905
which eventually became known
as the faction.

637
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,782
-This is news to you?
-To all of us.

638
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,242
Well, apparently
your work in the 21st

639
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,870
has been a greater agent of change
in the future than we thought.

640
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,621
I'm just tryin' to get my head
around this.

641
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,705
Yeah, you too?

642
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:38,751
So you're telling me the future you left
wasn't divided into two camps?

643
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:40,879
One loyal to the director
and the other believing

644
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,965
that decisions should be made by people,
not a machine?

645
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:47,552
No, and that kind of division is what
got us into trouble in the first place.

646
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,763
The world we left was loyal
to the director and the grand plan.

647
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,598
Looks like all the grand plan
has done so far

648
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:55,018
is screw things up worse than before.

649
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,812
- How do we know they're not right?
- What?

650
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,480
Don't be ridiculous.

651
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:03,610
Humans make decisions based
on greed and desire... hate.

652
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,195
- It's been proven.
- She's right.

653
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,989
The director saved us
from the brink of extinction

654
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,908
and created the grand plan,
we have to trust that.

655
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,160
-Is that what you believe?
-Of course.

656
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,661
All of you?

657
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,665
I wish I could.
But then again,

658
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,042
the director didn't send any of you

659
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,169
back into the body
of a young man addicted to heroin.

660
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,380
Listen, we cannot second-guess
what we came here to do.

661
00:40:24,464 --> 00:40:25,881
There is too much at stake.

662
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:29,760
We have to have faith that the director
is working toward the greater good.

663
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,932
So we should follow the director,

664
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,351
no matter what mission we're given.

665
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,603
-Is that right?
-What are you doing?

666
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,564
Carly?

667
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,109
Even if it's the hardest thing
you've ever had to do?

668
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:55,370
"Kill 3468."

669
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,038
That's what it says.

670
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:59,749
That is the mission
I was given by the director.

671
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,752
What do you think I should do?

672
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,880
Well, if you're asking...

673
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,591
I prefer that you didn't.

674
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,096
But it's not up to me.

675
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,017
What the hell is that?

676
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,394
Someone's on the property.
Perimeter breach.

677
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,562
-Assassins?
-The faction probably followed you here.

678
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:25,691
Marcy, Philip, since you're not occupied
with gun pointing at the moment,

679
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,568
would you go have a look outside, please?

680
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,070
Go over there.

681
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,451
I don't see anyone.

682
00:41:36,244 --> 00:41:37,912
I saw movement over by the house.

683
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,415
We have to destroy the quantum frame
before they get here.

684
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,000
-Don't do it, son.
-Boss?

685
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,168
You know what you have to do.

686
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,003
We don't have a choice!
They're gonna be here soon!

687
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,129
- Don't.
- There's another way.

688
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,235
It went right through her.

689
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,200
-Marcy! Help Trevor!
-Put the fucking gun down and help me!

690
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,580
Philip, what's going on out there?

691
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,748
- Philip!
- You'll be okay.

692
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:24,084
Keep applying pressure.

693
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,919
She's a doctor.
You'll be okay.

694
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,838
Turn off the defenses...

695
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,465
Drop the attenuation field.

696
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,383
The director could still help us.

697
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,009
Okay.

698
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:35,428
Okay.

699
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,560
They're getting closer.

700
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,903
The director's coming!

701
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,327
Traveler 3468.

702
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,828
Mission abort.

703
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,664
Destroy quantum frame immediately!

704
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:09,795
They're surrounding the building.

705
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,882
We need to get them
out of here!

706
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,301
They're coming in!

707
00:43:15,385 --> 00:43:17,678
Freeze! FBI!
Drop your weapons!
