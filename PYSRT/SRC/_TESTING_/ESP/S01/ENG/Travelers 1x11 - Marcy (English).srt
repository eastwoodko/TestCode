1
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,511
Hi.

2
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,723
Oh, hello.

3
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,060
Are you just watching me sleep?

4
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,519
Oh, well, you know, just...

5
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,733
patiently waiting for you to wake up.

6
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,195
So, uh...

7
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,490
we could do this?

8
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,392
What's wrong?

9
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,102
I'm fine. It'll pass.

10
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,695
Marcy, you're bleeding.

11
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:21,946
_

12
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,108
Oh, hi. It's Grace Day, calling
to confirm my appointment for 11:45.

13
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,378
Great. I'll see you then. Thanks.

14
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:39,627
_

15
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,680
Trevor!

16
00:03:50,467 --> 00:03:51,968
David...

17
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,152
I'm scared.

18
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,904
It's okay. I've got you.

19
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,364
You're gonna be fine.

20
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,880
_

21
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,372
No, no. Marce...

22
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,874
No. Come on, hon.

23
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,751
Marce!

24

00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,158
Coffee?

26
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,994
Well, it's the least I could do.

27
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,622
The least you can do is nothing,

28
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,416
and then leave without telling me,
which is what you usually do.

29
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,460
I'm... gonna get better.

30
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,545
Are you?

31
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,506
Mmm-hmm. Here.

32
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,677
Try it.

33
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,849
Is it good?

34
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,019
It's coffee.

35
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,438
Sorry. Just, uh...

36
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,649
- Don't let me stop you.
- MacLaren.

37
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,154
David? Yeah, of course I remember you.

38
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,864
What?

39
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,575
Okay, I'll be right there.

40
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:10,620
I'm sorry.

41
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,539
You have your priorities.

42
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,332
And you are one of them.

43
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,117
No! No!

44
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,119
Stay calm. Ms. Day, I can explain.

45
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,829
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

46
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,497
I'm trying to help you.
Please, just relax.

47
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:55,958
- Help me!
- Stop!

48
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,293
- Please, stop yelling. Stop!
- Help!

49
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,003
There's nobody for miles.

50
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,714
This is all happening for a reason.

51
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,842
You drugged and dragged
me into the woods?

52
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,677
I sedated you, yes,

53
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,097
but only because
I had to get you out here.

54
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,764
Off the grid. Away from all technology.

55
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,102
- This was the only way I could be sure.
- Sure of what?

56
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,728
What are you gonna do to me?

57
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,856
In the historical record,
Grace Day dies at 11:27 a.m.

58
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,067
on the corner
of Westlake and Harmon Avenue.

59
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,070
That's by my dentist.
How... how would...

60
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,031
I scouted the location. It was impossible
to determine what would kill you,

61
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,866
and if I had intervened...

62
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,410
Well, the traffic cams would've allowed
the director to take you.

63
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,498
The director?

64
00:07:36,937 --> 00:07:39,064
Look, I know how it sounds,
but I'm not a crazy person.

65
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,586
Well, do you know this director?

66
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,964
- The director sent me here.
- To do what?

67
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,298
Perform missions.

68
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,425
Like this?

69
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,344
No.

70
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,764
No, I'm breaking protocol by doing this.

71
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,980
Our mission...

72
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,981
is to save the world, Ms. Day.

73
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,527
I'm from the future.

74
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,449
- Agent MacLaren. Hey.
- David. Thanks for calling.

75
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,035
- Yeah.
- You mind giving us a moment?

76
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,288
Yeah. No, of course.
I'll... I'll just, uh...

77
00:08:17,642 --> 00:08:18,894
Thanks.

78
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,127
What happened?

79
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,545
I'm sorry.

80
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,713
I told him a thousand times not to...

81
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,841
Not to take me to the hospital.

82
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,678
No, that's okay. It's fine.
This is exactly where you should be.

83
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,929
Have they told you what's wrong?

84
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,347
I mean, do you...
Do you want to check your charts?

85
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,141
I know what's wrong.

86
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,851
There's too much pre-existing damage.

87
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,603
I don't understand.

88
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,232
My host's brain
was congenitally underdeveloped.

89
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,903
I came up with a treatment
that I thought was working.

90
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,489
I'm sorry that I didn't...

91
00:08:51,514 --> 00:08:52,932
It's all right.

92
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,279
We're gonna fix this.

93
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,828
I don't think that it's...

94
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,081
possible.

95
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,418
You just helped to practically
bring me back from the dead.

96
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,129
Anything's possible.

97
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,975
- Hello?
- Carly, hi.

98
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,643
I wasn't sure I'd be able to reach you.

99
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,272
Oh, I've been off the grid
for a day or so. I'm sorry.

100
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,191
Are you in any danger?

101
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,276
It's okay, you can tell me.

102
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,820
Uh, no, I'm fine. Why? What is it?

103
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,407
Well, to be honest, I was...

104
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,618
hoping you might have reasons
beyond your control

105
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,204
for why you abandoned your son
at his father's.

106
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,373
Abandoned? He's the father.

107
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,708
I'm well aware, but as he tells it,

108
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,836
you asked him to watch Jeffrey
for a couple of hours,

109
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,046
and haven't returned since.

110
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,373
That was two days ago.

111
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,884
I'm... I'm heading there right now.

112
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,844
Your actions indicate

113
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:57,430
that you trust him as a caregiver,

114
00:09:57,514 --> 00:10:00,683
so I have acted accordingly
and filed a recommendation

115
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,770
for his father to take custody
until the hearing is settled.

116
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,147
Jacqueline, please!

117
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,731
Have a good day, Ms. Shannon.

118
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,108
Wait!

119
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,118
Traveler 3468,

120
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,871
please greet arriving
Traveler 0014 today.

121
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,793
Where's my mom?

122
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,255
Uh, excuse me.
This... this boy's looking for his mom.

123
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,301
It's a calculation, really.

124
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,013
The director studies
the historical record

125
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:37,911
and then assesses which actions to take,

126
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,556
some big, some not so big,

127
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,933
that will best mitigate the conditions
we left behind.

128
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,727
- And how's it going?
- That's hard to say.

129
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,439
See, a while ago,
we deflected an asteroid

130
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:50,275
that would've caused
a huge disaster 18 months from now.

131
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,505
- Yeah, well, that's very big.
- That's what we thought!

132
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:56,614
We expected that it was gonna
impact the future so much so

133
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,492
that we might even cease to exist,
but nothing's changed!

134
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,829
So if... if something doesn't
work out the way you want it to,

135
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,914
why don't you just go back and try again?

136
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,083
That's an excellent question.

137
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,544
We tried that, of course.

138
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,964
But for some pretty complicated reasons
having to do with ripples in space time,

139
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,632
we can only go as far back

140
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,926
as the arrival point
of the most recent traveler.

141
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,648
There's no do-overs.

142
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,433
Anyway, now you know
why I've missed so much school.

143
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,814
I appreciate your honesty, Trevor.

144
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,526
I know you don't believe me.

145
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,571
That's okay. Neither would I.

146
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,907
I still wanted to tell you
I was doing this to preserve your life,

147
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,868
because you're a good person,

148
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,803
and the director will just
have to find another candidate.

149
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,003
- Philip?
- Over here.

150
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:56,009
- Anything show up?
- No. Nothing yet.

151
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,885
We've only got two potential hosts
for today.

152
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,887
First one gets hit by a truck
here in about an hour,

153
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,140
and the second one dies
streetside just before that.

154
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,156
- These are the locations.
- Okay.

155
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,924
You take that one, I'll take the other.

156
00:12:08,007 --> 00:12:09,687
Sorry, but what is our mission exactly?

157
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,148
To greet Traveler 0014.

158
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,110
- 0014? That's a low number.
- No kidding.

159
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,446
Why is the director sending back
someone so important?

160
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,781
I'm hoping it's to help Marcy!

161
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,455
Hey.

162
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,457
Here you go.

163
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,929
We gotta make sure we keep fluids in you.

164
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,756
Yeah, that apple juice is really gonna
make all the difference.

165
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,430
Sorry, I just...
I know you're trying to help.

166
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,641
- That's okay. Nobody likes hospitals.
- Hey!

167
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,518
That's not a very nice thing to say.

168
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,645
How are you feeling?

169
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,690
Uh, I'm... I'm okay. I'm just tired.

170
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,693
Can I... Can I...

171
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,779
- Can I go yet?
- Mmm. Afraid not.

172
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,823
We still have a number of tests
we'd like to run,

173
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,534
and unfortunately,
your MRI didn't turn out.

174
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,160
What do you mean?

175
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,496
Well, it's just that
if the scan was accurate,

176
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,373
you'd barely even be able to communicate
with me right now,

177
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,417
but it's no big deal,
we just need to do it again,

178
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,667
and I'll put a rush on this one for you.
Don't worry.

179
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,546
Everything else appears stable.

180
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,799
So I will let you know as soon
as we get you slotted in, okay?

181
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,635
Thank you, Doctor.

182
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,011
All right.

183
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:41,999
_

184
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,787
Look out!

185
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,502
Damn it, Morrison, you were on that!

186
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,712
This is the list
of potential host candidates?

187
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,881
Not all of them, obviously, but yeah.

188
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,632
Then all these people are gonna die?

189
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,427
Yeah. Why? What's wrong?

190
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:05,928
I know this person.

191
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,263
Shit.

192
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,308
It wasn't my fault!

193
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:12,810
Trevor?

194
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,413
Trevor, where are you?

195
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,900
Trevor, what the hell have you done?

196
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,488
There.

197
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,367
That should do it.
We passed your time of death.

198
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,576
You feel fine?

199
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:31,579
Other than the obvious discomfort.

200
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,081
Good.

201
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,208
Then it wasn't anything medical.

202
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,920
Okay...

203
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:41,923
Uh, what is that?

204
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,759
I'm gonna take you back now.
You can claim a sick day and stay home.

205
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,177
That doesn't answer my question.

206
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,888
See, this is gonna erase the last
24 hours from your memory.

207
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,140
To you, it'll be like you overslept
and none of this happened.

208
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,600
And if I refuse?

209
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,186
I'm afraid this is part of the deal
for saving your life.

210
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,689
Not to mention, I told you a whole lot
of things no one can ever know.

211
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,106
Okay, but so what happens next?

212
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,943
You knock me out and you drag me
back out through the woods?

213
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,987
You've been favoring
your side like it hurts.

214
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,534
Stitches.

215
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,329
I had some surgery the other day.

216
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,414
Organ donor.

217
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,834
Well, ow!

218
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,544
Why don't I just walk back out with you?

219
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,087
You know,
you don't want to tear those stitches,

220
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,842
and it couldn't have been easy
carrying me all the way out here.

221
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,136
Okay.
But I have to keep your hands tied.

222
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,763
I understand.

223
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,862
Boss, you there?

224
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,822
Yeah.
Nothing's happened at my T.E.L.L. yet.

225
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,949
- Any luck with yours?
- No, nothing.

226
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,869
I guess that's one less candidate.

227
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,871
No, I mean nothing happened.

228
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,623
A crane dropped its load on the sidewalk.

229
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,958
No one died. No traveler arrived.

230
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,127
You sure you had the time right?

231
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,212
It's possible
the historical record was off.

232
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,797
Some of my bets didn't turn out,

233
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,640
a few race results I'd memorized
changed.

234
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:08,968
What? Why didn't you tell me?

235
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,803
It was just a few races.

236
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,016
Boss, to be honest,
I don't think that's it.

237
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,102
I think Trevor might have intervened.

238
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,980
What makes you think that?

239
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,698
Back when I wrote all those T.E.L.Ls
on the front door of ops,

240
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,778
he said he knew one of them.

241
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,821
Grace Day.

242
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,575
No. No, Trevor wouldn't break protocol.

243
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,203
Oh, shit.

244
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,414
Okay.

245
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,458
You look for Trevor.
I'll work on a backup plan for Marcy.

246
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,047
- We need to talk.
- Carly!

247
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,883
- What a... a pleasant surprise.
- Don't.

248
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,511
Don't? Don't what?

249
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,262
Don't do what you're doing.

250
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,306
- Playing these games. They won't work.
- Okay.

251
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,891
You're not gonna get Jeffrey from me.

252
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,811
I don't have to take him from you
when you straight up hand him over.

253
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,021
Look, you are manipulating
the wrong person!

254
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,899
Jeffrey is my blood! My son!

255
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,943
And I could not be more serious
when I tell you...

256
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,360
You're trash.

257
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:10,905
What the fuck you just say to me?

258
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,281
I said you're trash.

259
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,617
And it's only a matter of time
before your son sees it, too.

260
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,036
- You watch your mouth.
- Or what?

261
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,833
You know you don't deserve
to be a father. You're a mess.

262
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:24,295
And yet I'm the one taking care of him
while you bail for days at a time?

263
00:17:24,378 --> 00:17:27,046
Yeah, well, someone had to
make me feel like a woman.

264
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,465
God knows you never could.

265
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,180
You know,
when you're close to me like this,

266
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,891
I can really smell
what a failure you are.

267
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:48,234
I see what you're doing.

268
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,907
When will you learn
that I am not an idiot?

269
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,998
You come to my work like this again,
and I'll file a restraining order.

270
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,726
David?

271
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,937
Can you get me some more juice?

272
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,480
Yeah, no problem.

273
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:28,900
Thanks.

274
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,737
Just push that
if anything happens while I'm gone.

275
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,915
Guys, get me out of here.

276
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,667
They want...

277
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,669
to run more tests,

278
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,087
and if my MRI comes back
with the same results,

279
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,173
they'll be doing experiments on me
till I die.

280
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,134
Philip, hack their database
and get my file, okay?

281
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,529
You got it.

282
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,851
Sit tight, Marcy.

283
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,187
Hi. I was called in
to speak with an Agent Forbes.

284
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,439
Uh, Forbes is my partner.

285
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,232
I'll take it from here. Thanks, man.

286
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,860
- Uh, come on in, Officer...
- Boyd.

287
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,070
Boyd.

288
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,115
You really need to stop making
a habit of this.

289
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,826
Protocol 6. This is an emergency.

290
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,452
Our medic's in the hospital,

291
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,330
and her condition might be
beyond 21st-century medicine.

292
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,623
The director will send help
if the intention is to save her.

293
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,335
Well, help hasn't arrived,
and she's getting worse.

294
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,993
And you're coming to me why?

295
00:19:31,018 --> 00:19:33,297
I just want access to your team's medic.

296
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,882
No.

297
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,593
Could you at least ask your medic,
let them decide for themselves?

298
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,804
I just did. I'm the medic.

299
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:41,430
And team leader?

300
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,557
Yeah.

301
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,893
We lost ours along the way.
Someone had to step up.

302
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,020
Well, then you, of all people,
should understand.

303
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,690
We're just trying to do
everything in our power

304
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,316
not to lose one of our own.

305
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,028
Just have a look at her.
That's all I ask.

306
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,914
- Hello?
- David, I need your help.

307
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,708
We gotta get Marcy out of the hospital.

308
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,501
Is that a good idea?

309
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,254
I wouldn't be asking, okay,
if this wasn't serious.

310
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:17,091
Well, she's... she's got doctors
and nurses coming in every five minutes.

311
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,927
- I have a way around that.
- Okay, look, I wanna help,

312
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:23,180
but you said so yourself,
this is exactly where she needs to be.

313
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,224
Well, the situation has changed.

314
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,644
If the doctors continue to test Marcy,
her cover will be blown.

315
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,687
I don't care about her cover.

316
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,564
This is important work, David.

317
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,441
She told me she was dying.

318
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,403
And I have no intention
of letting that happen.

319
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,697
I have a plan. But the only way
I can pull it off is with your help.

320
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,538
What do you need me to do?

321
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,833
I need you to be in her room
at exactly 1:07 sharp.

322
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,419
- Can you manage that?
- Yeah, of course, then what?

323
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,837
Stand by.

324
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,768
So why haven't you gone back
and stopped Hitler and Stalin?

325
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,436
I love the way your mind works,

326
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,398
but actually, we're only able to come
back to the modern age of computers

327
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,234
because we need the precise time
and location of the host's death.

328
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,444
Close doesn't work.

329
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,948
- Then you're not really Trevor?
- No.

330
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:23,991
You remember my concussion?

331
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,035
When my consciousness arrived,
it supplanted his

332
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,162
just before the last punch would have
killed him.

333
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,372
Instead, I conceded the fight,
and here we are.

334
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,791
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

335
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,501
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Grace, are you okay?

336
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,838
Grace?

337
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,802
Grace!

338
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,430
Grace!

339
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,157
Okay. Oh, God. All right. Okay.

340
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,287
Grace! Grace!

341
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,788
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

342
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,582
Grace! Grace! Grace! Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

343
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,761
Stop! Grace!

344
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,445
- Grace!
- 0115, are you out of your mind?

345
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:46,282
You do not get to change history
on your own!

346
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,783
But I saved her.
How could you possibly...

347
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,953
She made a phone call.
GPS, voice recognition.

348
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,207
Oh, great, I'm bleeding.

349
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:59,003
Been here less than a minute,
and already my body's damaged.

350
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,838
Well?

351
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,776
Knock, knock, Marcy. It's time
for you to head into your MRI...

352
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,447
I am so sorry.

353
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,618
- You murdered her.
- Oh, get over yourself.

354
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,537
Historically, Grace Day died today.

355
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,914
Don't get mad at me because
you got caught trying to play God.

356
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:38,459
Well, candidates shouldn't be taken
after their T.E.L.L. has passed.

357
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,712
It happened. It's forever.
So get over it.

358
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,299
Are you here to deliver
the repercussions?

359
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,431
No, I didn't jump here to spank you.
I have a mission to complete.

360
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:50,721
If I can get this goddamn car started.

361
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,016
Huh.

362
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,768
Now what?

363
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,730
Home lumbar puncture
is pretty unorthodox,

364
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,936
but looks like it helped relieve
some intracranial pressure.

365
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,069
What the hell did you do with the CSF?

366
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,322
She made a serum to help stabilize
the neurotransmitter levels.

367
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,782
Smart. Kept you alive for this long.

368
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,994
But you know it could only
buy you so much time.

369
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,954
I know.

370
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,790
Of course you do.

371
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,792
You've known the whole time.
It must have been brutal.

372
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:24,921
Okay, I can give you

373
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,758
a neurotransmitter stimulant
I developed for a mission

374
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,470
- that should help you short-term, but...
- Thank you for the second opinion.

375
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,097
I wish it was a better one.

376
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,059
What? That's it?

377
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,728
That's all you can do?

378
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,313
What about nanites?

379
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,233
There are a number of medical traveler
teams capable of amazing things.

380
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,944
Yeah, we know.
But that takes orders from the director.

381
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,940
That should start working right away.
You okay?

382
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:53,992
Thank you.

383
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,420
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

384
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,248
The shot I gave her should help her feel
more or less normal for a little while,

385
00:25:07,324 --> 00:25:10,426
but... her neurons are still going
like fireworks.

386
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,263
But, hey,
if the director wants her saved...

387
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,807
- Yeah. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

388
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,232
Check in with your team.

389
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,525
Why?

390
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,737
Because I'm also on a mission
to locate 0014,

391
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,406
and by now,
they should have his coordinates.

392
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,208
They were sent a messenger this morning.
So check in and use this

393
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,827
so I can hear both of you.

394
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,833
Trevor, where the hell have you been?

395
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,835
I'm sorry, I felt like I had to do it.

396
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,378
You broke protocol!

397
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,090
But the new traveler showed up anyway.

398
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:52,634
Yeah, we'll talk about that later.

399
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,220
Is she 0014?

400
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:56,388
Oh, for God's sake!
They haven't located him yet?

401
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:59,433
If he didn't arrive after the messenger,
check the T.E.L.Ls from before.

402
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:02,686
Why would the director order us
to greet someone who had already arrived?

403
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,355
Who am I talking to now?

404
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,150
Call me Grace.

405
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,612
We share the same mission,
Agent MacLaren, and it involves Marcy.

406
00:26:12,577 --> 00:26:15,330
There's one potential T.E.L.L.
from earlier today.

407
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,826
Uh...

408
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,496
- A farm outside of town.
- Is that it?

409
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,622
Obviously.

410
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,040
Send us the coordinates
and meet us there with your whole team.

411
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:29,004
Here.

412
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,050
Philip, follow when you can.

413
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:35,636
Carly?

414
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,012
You're with me.

415
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,335
Come on, 014.
Open the damn door. It's safe!

416
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,086
My name's Ellis! Get off my property!

417
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,256
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
- What about the kid?

418
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,758
He's nobody! Come on.
We don't have much time.

419
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,014
Why should I trust you?

420
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:24,726
'Cause without me, you'd still be writing
shitty script prompts in a leaky dome

421
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,605
like the grumpy, no imagination,
old bastard you are.

422
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,779
027.

423
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,781
I'd recognize that tone in any century.

424
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,326
- Call me Grace.
- You here to hide, too?

425
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,369
Partly. Your defenses are up?

426
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,246
With you? Always.

427
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,458
Got 'em up just after feeding the pigs.

428
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:51,127
- I got pigs!
- Okay. I want your code.

429
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,547
What makes you think
I'm gonna give it to ya?

430
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,260
And you are?

431
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,511
Trevor.

432
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:03,682
You look like somebody
shot your puppy, Trevor.

433
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,559
Do I?

434
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,311
She's not a real people person,

435
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,480
but her heart's in the right place.
You'll see.

436
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:12,138
Come on in.

437
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,993
All right. Come on. Get in here.

438
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,631
So, how'd you find me?

439
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,758
My team did. They'll be here soon.

440
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,175
Your reinforcements.

441
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,844
014 needs protection.

442
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,929
He wrote a backdoor hack
that a faction in the future

443
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:45,015
is desperate to get their hands on.

444
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,517
What faction?

445
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,895
A group is trying to topple the director,
and they wanna use my code to do it.

446
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,658
I came here to hide it, so it's useless.

447
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:52,838
Not useless.

448
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,401
How's it gonna help you in the 21st?

449
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,193
I'm trying to save somebody's life.

450
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,403
Hmm.

451
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,696
Is that so hard to believe?

452
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,740
- Yes.
- Definitely!

453
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,453
I made a mistake
that needs to be corrected.

454
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,789
Hacker with a heart of gold.

455
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,969
You're programmers.

456
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:14,836
- This one's the director's favorite.
- Only when you're not around.

457
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,340
- So how's my code gonna save a life?
- You'll see.

458
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,802
And don't worry.
I'll destroy it as soon as I'm done.

459
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,637
Wait. You need it now?

460
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,474
I was just gonna start on supper.

461
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:30,561
Oh, he can do that.
Do you know how to prepare food?

462
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:31,812
Yeah, sure.

463
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:34,440
Well, hurry up.
I haven't eaten in centuries.

464
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:49,955
You've reached
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

465
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,748
Please leave a message.

466
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,340
Agent MacLaren, it's, uh, David Mailer.

467
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:57,463
I really stuck my neck out
back at the hospital,

468
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,965
and I'll probably run into
some of these people again,

469
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,343
and now I'm just waiting
on a Marcy update,

470
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:03,802
so I'm not gonna lie to you...

471
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,347
Feel a little pissed off.

472
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,226
Which isn't to say that I'm unwilling
to help, obviously I am,

473
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,021
but there's a difference between helping
someone and being used by someone.

474
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:17,733
So, call me back.

475
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,532
Trevor?

476
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,659
Trevor?

477
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,644
Who is it?

478
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,061
3468.

479
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,231
I received a message
to greet Traveler 0014.

480
00:30:59,402 --> 00:31:01,154
Well, then...

481
00:31:01,472 --> 00:31:02,473
greetings!

482
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:05,572
- Uh...
- And you! Greetings!

483
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,993
So what's the mission?

484
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,578
You tell me.

485
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,124
We just told you.
Our mission was to greet you.

486
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,126
Then mission accomplished.

487
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,335
You folks hungry?

488
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,463
Your friend's cooking supper,
though I think

489
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,549
he was expecting a couple more.

490
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,640
Yeah, they're on the way.

491
00:31:25,665 --> 00:31:27,209
Finally. Where is she?

492
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,764
You must be Grace.

493
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,198
What's going on?

494
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,366
There's a plan you need to be aware of.

495
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:51,827
These two are programmers.

496
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,413
They want to try
an experimental procedure on you.

497
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,832
What sort of procedure?

498
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,375
Well, they say it
could correct your condition.

499
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,003
Table isn't gonna set itself, folks.

500
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,630
Grace wants to talk to you.

501
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,512
Over here, Marcy.

502
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,519
Uh, my team said you think
you can help me?

503
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,605
Well, Marcy, nice to meet you.

504
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,733
Just give me one second here.
I'm almost done.

505
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,069
There we go.

506
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,153
Sit.

507
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:37,623
How conversant are you
with the theory of quantum entanglement?

508
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:41,793
Um, I know it's the basis
of how we transfer consciousness.

509
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:45,881
And in order for that to happen,
an alignment has to occur.

510
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,424
Unforgiving precision.

511
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:52,303
A misfire will kill
the incoming consciousness.

512
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,891
We need to be 100% locked in.

513
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,206
That's great, Marcy. Thanks.

514
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,332
What was that?

515
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:24,085
Oh, just a calibration test of sorts.

516
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,546
Now, let's eat!

517
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,726
Not only was I part
of the programming group,

518
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,521
I was the team lead
on the social media research.

519
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,065
You found the host candidates?

520
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,191
Yes.

521
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:49,110
The early successes made us
overconfident in our analysis,

522
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,530
so when we came to Marcy's host...

523
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:53,990
What's this one again?

524
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,700
Carrot.

525
00:33:55,725 --> 00:33:57,869
- Carrot.
- Mmm-hmm.

526
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,080
This is spaghetti squash.

527
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:04,626
My host has a refrigerator full
of something called bacon.

528
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,504
When I realized what it was,
I cried for a good five minutes.

529
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:10,006
You would.

530
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,642
Where was I?

531
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:13,669
You were saying
how you got Marcy's life wrong.

532
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:17,777
Oh, right. Well, I can't tell you
how much I regret that, Marcy.

533
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,559
Uh, people make mistakes. I understand.

534
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,436
But you don't understand
how I intend to fix it.

535
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,105
No. I don't.

536
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,192
By repackaging your original upload

537
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,863
in order to bypass the damaged
areas in your host brain.

538
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,615
It really is brilliant.

539
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,825
How does this process
not lose information?

540
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,494
Oh, it does. Of course it does.

541
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:40,954
I had to prioritize.

542
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,874
A few memories,
some life experiences will be lost,

543
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,876
but the human mind is full
of useless things.

544
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:47,919
You won't even be able
to tell the difference.

545
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,255
What about all my memories of the 21st?

546
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,091
Well, obviously none of that.

547
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,260
I didn't have access to it, did I?

548
00:34:57,137 --> 00:35:00,974
Just think about this
as a reboot of the original.

549
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,810
A reboot? What will happen
to her current consciousness?

550
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:06,396
- Same thing that always happens.
- It'll get overwritten.

551
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,858
- You mean she'll die.
- It will be her.

552
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,694
By any reasonable definition,
she will be Marcy.

553
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,988
Just not... this one.

554
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,696
I should have told you.

555
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:58,907
Would it have made a difference?

556
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,747
No.

557
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,662
Was it ever a threat to the mission?

558
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,288
I don't think so.

559
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,293
Privacy might not exist
where we come from,

560
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,628
but it does in the 21st, so...

561
00:36:14,304 --> 00:36:15,548
Thank you.

562
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,301
And really,
what kind of an asshole would I be

563
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,011
if I started yelling at you now?

564
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,829
We'll brief you after the transition,
in detail.

565
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,523
Philip will remember everything.

566
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,024
No. Not everything.

567
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,612
I'm not the same person today
as when I arrived.

568
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,115
Doesn't matter how long ago it was.

569
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,200
It might as well have been centuries.

570
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,745
In a way, it was.

571
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:50,250
You can tell her events and missions,

572
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,295
and everything you can think of
in the most minute detail, but...

573
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:59,217
you can't tell her...

574
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,553
What?

575
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,183
- Doesn't matter.
- Why do you say "her"?

576
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,487
Because she won't be me.

577
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:11,856
She won't remember...

578
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,775
the most important part of who I am now.

579
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:23,241
I'm not gonna sit here and pretend
to know what makes us who we are.

580
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,413
But I gotta figure it's more
than just the sum of what we remember.

581
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,792
Yeah, you're right.

582
00:37:33,614 --> 00:37:35,407
And I won't lie to you.

583
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,714
You're important to us,
and I don't wanna lose you.

584
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:40,716
I'm really just...

585
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:43,261
one person on one team.

586
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,721
That happens to be here
to save the world.

587
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,683
So there's that.

588
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,361
I'm not gonna tell you what to do.

589
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,554
Oh, there she is.

590
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:30,475
- What if I don't go through with it?
- What?

591
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,854
What if I refuse the procedure?

592
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,565
Why wouldn't you go through with it?
You'll die horribly.

593
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,651
Don't I have the right to die
on my own terms?

594
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:41,820
No.

595
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:44,447
Do you have any idea
the trouble I've gone through?

596
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,283
And I'm grateful for that, I'm humbled
by it, but I'm asking the question,

597
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,869
- is it an option?
- No.

598
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,536
I think it is.

599
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,002
You have a responsibility
to the grand plan.

600
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,711
You've taken an oath.

601
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,592
Can I just...

602
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,054
have the time to go home
and think about it?

603
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:09,973
Home.

604
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,978
It's important to me that I see someone
before I make this decision.

605
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:20,733
Fine.

606
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,195
Thank you.

607
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,072
Come on. We'll take you.

608
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,012
Well, that didn't go as planned.

609
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,140
Are you sure we're safe here?

610
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,101
- Uh, I've taken measures.
- Well, will they be enough?

611
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:56,978
I also got a shotgun.

612
00:40:14,624 --> 00:40:16,624
_

613
00:40:20,018 --> 00:40:22,018
_

614
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,886
Thanks for coming in.

615
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,763
I just didn't really want to be
alone right now.

616
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,182
Of course.

617
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,061
David will be home soon,

618
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,730
so I'll just go make some tea
while we wait.

619
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,984
I'll give you a hand.

620
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,492
I'm gonna give her a hand, too.

621
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,754
What the hell did she say to you
to make you consider

622
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:07,048
not having a medic on our team?

623
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,717
She didn't have to.
I know what she's going through.

624
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,047
Do you?

625
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:14,139
What happened
to "the mission comes first"?

626
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,142
She just needs a little time.
I'm sure she'll make the right decision.

627
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,174
You shouldn't have given her the choice.

628
00:41:19,257 --> 00:41:21,521
It's a little more complicated
than that, Carly.

629
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,938
Look around.

630
00:41:23,239 --> 00:41:25,191
She has a life in the 21st.

631
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,195
We all do.

632
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,367
Some of us have made sacrifices

633
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,157
in order to do what we came here to do.

634
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,082
This isn't about
any one person's happiness.

635
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,250
Tell me.

636
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:44,669
What is it about?

637
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,641
I have a unique perspective on this.

638
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,019
In the early days
of testing the technology,

639
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:02,344
my much younger consciousness

640
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,754
was transferred out of my body
and back again.

641
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,567
That's not really the same thing.

642
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,360
You still had your memories.

643
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,279
It was ages ago. Who can remember?

644
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,115
My point is,
I was still me when I returned.

645
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,825
I didn't feel any different.

646
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,953
Neither will she.

647
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,831
"She"?

648
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,583
You'll be the same person, Marcy.

649
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:28,754
So everyone keeps saying.

650
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:31,257
My perspective is entirely selfish.

651
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,801
I just don't want to lose you.

652
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,262
All I know is...

653
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,640
I just need to talk to David first.

654
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,185
I didn't realize you had someone
that important to you in your life.

655
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,686
Neither did I.

656
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,151
I mean, obviously I can't tell him
what I have to choose, but I think...

657
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,972
just...

658
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,155
sitting down and...

659
00:42:54,249 --> 00:42:57,629
_

660
00:42:57,654 --> 00:42:59,322
Marcy?

661
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:08,586
Marcy!

662
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:29,690
No!

663
00:43:35,265 --> 00:43:38,073
- Marcy! Stand down.
- We're your team.

664
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:40,410
This isn't where I'm supposed to be.

665
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,077
We know. You're safe.

666
00:43:42,162 --> 00:43:43,454
What's going on?

667
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,873
This isn't your original T.E.L.L.

668
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,335
Traveler 3569.

669
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,756
Welcome to the 21st.

670
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,774
Marcy?

671
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,738
- Agent MacLaren?
- Hey, David.

672
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,033
What's happening?

673
00:44:25,455 --> 00:44:26,456
Thank God.

674
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,916
I thought something terrible
had happened to you.

675
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,712
You must be David.

676
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:35,756
I'm told we're close.

677
00:44:41,919 --> 00:44:50,116
