1
00:00:00,447 --> 00:00:02,447
Previously on Travelers.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,971
FBI!

3
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:06,433
Our mission was to acquire a
component from Russian Travelers

4
00:00:06,435 --> 00:00:08,130
and deliver it
to another team for testing,

5
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:09,464
but they got greedy.

6
00:00:09,466 --> 00:00:10,666
A Traveler team turned on you?

7
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:11,970
He must be new.

8
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,335
We gotta talk about this family.

9
00:00:13,337 --> 00:00:14,570
We're not a family.

10
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:16,576
Mother, father, and son.

11
00:00:16,578 --> 00:00:17,880
Did your host have a family?

12
00:00:17,905 --> 00:00:19,396
David. His name is David.

13
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:21,596
Your priorities
are all outta whack!

14
00:00:21,598 --> 00:00:23,311
We came here with a team of five.

15
00:00:25,674 --> 00:00:27,073
Well, we're down to two now.

16
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:29,343
Don't think the future
doesn't get its hands dirty.

17
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:34,980
Dad?

18
00:00:34,982 --> 00:00:36,815
Dad!

19
00:00:36,817 --> 00:00:38,451
Please, stop!

20
00:00:38,453 --> 00:00:39,918
Daddy! Stop!

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,787
Dad! Stop the car!

22
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:42,921
You're scaring me!

23
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:45,958
Dad! Stop! Please!

24
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,794
Dad!

25
00:00:48,796 --> 00:00:50,429
Daddy, stop! Stop!

26
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:54,766
Dad, stop!

27
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:56,768
Dad, stop!

28
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:03,508
Dad, stop, please!

29
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:16,887
Welcome to the 21st.

30
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:18,055
I'm Traveler 3468.

31
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,056
3117.

32
00:01:19,058 --> 00:01:20,257
3890.

33
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:21,592
3892.

34
00:01:21,594 --> 00:01:24,228
What's happening?

35
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:26,329
Misfire.

36
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:32,202
Shit.

37
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:33,203
Uh...

38
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:34,870
Hi. I'm Grant.

39
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:36,239
What's your name?

40
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,373
Charlotte.

41
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,242
Charlotte, it's okay.

42
00:01:39,244 --> 00:01:40,843
I'm a policeman.

43
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:42,796
No, really. I... I am.

44
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:44,009
See?

45
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:45,644
It says "FBI".

46
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:48,412
Well, it's like a policeman.
It's better, even!

47
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:49,814
Look, my friends and I

48
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:51,349
need to have a... a talk with your...

49
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:52,751
your mom and your dad and your brother

50
00:01:52,753 --> 00:01:53,820
about what just happened.

51
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,319
Why was he doing that?

52
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:57,088
Why did you do that?

53
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,957
Look, I know
you're upset. I would be, too.

54
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,858
Just... just let us... let us talk

55
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,192
with your family, and everything
will be all right.

56
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:03,593
I promise.

57
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,204
Sweetie, do you have any other
family that live around here?

58
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:07,504
10 clicks back down the road.

59
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:08,724
Grandmother, mother's side.

60
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:10,034
Your side.

61
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:12,836
How about if I take you there?

62
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:14,138
I want to go with my mom.

63
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,401
You go with the nice man, Charlotte.

64
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:18,954
We'll be back in a few days
and we'll be a family again.

65
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,784
Okay, that's my car over there.
The black one.

66
00:02:22,786 --> 00:02:24,359
Can you wait there for me?

67
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:30,519
Car was going pretty fast.

68
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:32,021
Maybe she was moving inside of it?

69
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:33,889
It's a tough T.E.L.L.
for the Director to calculate.

70
00:02:33,891 --> 00:02:35,075
Well, it doesn't matter, it happened.

71
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:36,725
I'll deal with her now.

72
00:02:36,727 --> 00:02:38,026
Who is your historian?

73
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:39,895
She was going to be.

74
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,200
This isn't nearly enough to set you up,

75
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:46,301
so put it on

76
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:48,036
"Non-Event Horizon" in the fourth.

77
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:50,532
It's a horse race.

78
00:02:50,557 --> 00:02:52,056
Tomorrow. Look it up.

79
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,711
This is the device.

80
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:57,912
Keep it upright.

81
00:02:58,497 --> 00:02:59,580
What are you gonna do with her?

82
00:03:00,141 --> 00:03:01,548
I guess I'll just take her to Grandma's

83
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,884
and explain that Mom and Dad
will be back after the mission...

84
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:06,721
obviously without
mentioning the mission,

85
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:09,155
which is in just over 48 hours,

86
00:03:09,157 --> 00:03:10,590
and you're down a team member.

87
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,491
- Can you make the adjustment?
- We'll be ready.

88
00:03:12,956 --> 00:03:14,594
Go. We can brief them.

89
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:15,695
Good.

90
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,330
Protocol 5 till then.

91
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,390
Okay, boss. It's done.

92
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,502
Tip went out as of this morning.

93
00:03:26,504 --> 00:03:28,073
I wonder how many
misfires there have been

94
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,274
since we started this.

95
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,744
First wave was upwards of 30%.

96
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,345
Wow! Nobody told me that.

97
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:35,114
Yeah. Me neither.

98
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:37,349
Would you have still volunteered?

99
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:40,271
Probably.

100
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:42,787
I mean, if you think about it,

101
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,288
what other choice did we...

102

103
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:47,515
Carly...

104
00:04:50,686 --> 00:04:51,916
Carly?

105
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:57,590
Trevor?

106
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:01,094
I'm over here.

107
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,083
You all right?

108
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:09,435
My head.

109
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:11,308
Concussion.

110
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:14,673
Can you tell if Marcy's breathing?

111
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:16,243
I can't see her face.

112
00:05:18,313 --> 00:05:19,445
Slow and shallow.

113
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:23,949
Philip?

114
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:27,139
Philip!

115
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:34,125
What do we know?

116
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:39,581
Not where we are,

117
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:41,979
not for how long,

118
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:43,734
or who abducted us,

119
00:05:43,736 --> 00:05:45,899
but it's been a couple
of hours, at least.

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,591
My mouth is dry.

121
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:51,876
No eyes or ears on us that I can see.

122
00:05:51,878 --> 00:05:54,144
We shouldn't count on it.

123
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,747
Ah! They cut out my com.
I can't feel it.

124
00:05:56,749 --> 00:05:57,748
Yeah, same.

125
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,749
I gotta stop getting

126
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,194
whacked on the head.

127
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:02,301
I'm a blank here.

128
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:05,889
Where's the boss?

129
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:07,886
MacLaren was on his way
to Grandma's house.

130
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,941
So he wasn't with us when we were taken.

131
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,132
That's good. There's a chance
he'll find us before the mission.

132
00:06:14,134 --> 00:06:15,842
Well, he'd better hurry up.

133
00:06:17,201 --> 00:06:19,101
Wheelchairs?

134
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:21,904
Whoever they are,
they plan on moving us.

135
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:24,373
Don't know about that.

136
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,608
They're giving us fluids intravenously.

137
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,911
I think we're gonna be
in these chairs a while.

138
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:31,780
And it's been a Lotta years
since I felt this sensation,

139
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:35,116
but... it's pretty unmistakable.

140
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,552
Catheter.

141
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:41,555
Oh, God.

142
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:44,458
- Is that what that is?
- Yes, ma'am.

143
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,927
Do me a favor.

144
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:47,660
Don't say anything remotely suggestive.

145
00:06:47,662 --> 00:06:49,229
It could get very painful over here.

146
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:50,797
Don't make me laugh.

147
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:52,319
I'm serious!

148
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:55,135
It's like a 17-year-old
male's default setting.

149
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:03,072
Look who showed up to work.

150
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:05,245
Hey.

151
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:06,848
Thought you were driving to Olympia?

152
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:09,279
I was delayed.

153
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,584
Where were you this morning?

154
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:15,287
Oh, Kathryn, uh,

155
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:17,622
she needed me to pick up
an antique chair for a client

156
00:07:17,624 --> 00:07:18,958
because it wouldn't fit in her car.

157
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,392
Why? What'd I miss?

158
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:22,194
You know, the funny thing
about court dates is,

159
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:23,461
when you miss one,

160
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:24,528
you don't get another one next week.

161
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,064
You get it next month or next year.

162
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,432
That was this morning.

163
00:07:27,434 --> 00:07:28,933
It's cool, I covered for you again,

164
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:30,501
but you're the lead on this one, Mac.

165
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:33,071
- I'm sorry, man.
- Don't apologize to me.

166
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:36,474
You got one angry prosecutor
on your hands.

167
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:05,534
Well, hello, sir.

168
00:08:06,284 --> 00:08:08,637
Didn't catch your name on the way in.

169
00:08:10,108 --> 00:08:11,540
I was unconscious.

170
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:14,675
I'm Trevor.

171
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,140
So here's a thing...

172
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:19,514
I got this geography test tomorrow

173
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:20,948
that I really gotta study for.

174
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,732
Capital cities, countries...

175
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:26,521
Am I gonna be able to do that?

176
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:28,123
'Cause it's pretty likely

177
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,557
that my parents are gonna
ground me again if I fail.

178
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:31,269
Know what that means?

179
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:34,703
Having to watch hours of golf
on television with Gary!

180
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:37,231
Don't do it to me, man.

181
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,366
Where are you taking him?

182
00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:40,950
Hey, asshole!

183
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:43,594
I said, where are you taking him?

184
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:45,438
Bye!

185
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,011
I know it goes against your instincts...

186
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:51,710
but don't waste any more energy

187
00:08:51,712 --> 00:08:53,312
trying to get free from your restraints.

188
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:54,547
It's not gonna happen.

189
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:06,049
Hello?

190
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:11,493
Marce?

191
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:23,129
Hey. It's me.

192
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:25,886
Um, I thought you said you were
gonna be coming home early

193
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:27,126
for... for dinner tonight,

194
00:09:27,128 --> 00:09:30,548
and, uh, I couldn't decide
what we were gonna have,

195
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,083
so I brought the ingredients

196
00:09:32,085 --> 00:09:35,408
for basically two different...
...dinners,

197
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,632
and I was just curious to see

198
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:40,823
what you'd... you'd like
to have tonight, so...

199
00:09:42,294 --> 00:09:44,394
Yeah, one of them would be, like, uh,

200
00:09:44,396 --> 00:09:46,796
roast chicken with vegetables,

201
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:48,565
and the other one,

202
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,634
it's more of a...
it's like a pasta thing I do,

203
00:09:51,636 --> 00:09:53,570
and, um...

204
00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:55,805
well, now... now I'm talking to you

205
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:58,057
as if you're actually on the phone.

206
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:00,383
I don't know why I do that.
That's, uh...

207
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,012
Well, that's weird. So
anyway, give me a call,

208
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:06,281
or I will see you
when you get back here.

209
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:07,056
Hopefully soon.

210
00:10:07,058 --> 00:10:10,551
Okay. I'm gonna
start on the roast chicken...

211
00:10:11,522 --> 00:10:12,939
unless you really want the pasta,

212
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:14,032
in which case call me back.

213
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,267
It's David.

214
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:16,989
And I'm doing it again. Bye.

215
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,541
Ow...

216
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,977
We're here, Marcy.

217
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:44,098
How bad is it?

218
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:45,513
My head and my neck.

219
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,053
Probably...

220
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:53,056
just whiplash from the impact.

221
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:04,867
This is the worst hospital
in the world or...

222
00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,168
We've been abducted.

223
00:11:08,154 --> 00:11:10,572
I obviously vomited on myself.

224
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:13,009
Anybody clock when?

225
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:15,577
Probably before we got here.

226
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,980
The stink's not as bad as it was.

227
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,215
Sorry.

228
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,652
Smells around here
aren't going to improve much.

229
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,120
We've only met one of our captors.

230
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:29,557
He came and wheeled Philip
out of here a while ago.

231
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:32,193
Never said a word. That's all we know.

232
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:34,562
We know they intend to keep us
alive for a while at least.

233
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:35,930
They've got us on I.V.s.

234
00:11:37,275 --> 00:11:38,932
How long have I been out?

235
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,759
A few hours longer than us.

236
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:55,214
Now don't
be like that, Mr. Giant!

237
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,450
Pick me.

238
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,391
Take me instead of her!
I'm asking nice here!

239
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,063
Come on!

240
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,453
_

241
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:18,126
What? Am I supposed to answer?

242
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,700
Who have I told what?

243
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,553
I don't understand.

244
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:35,794
_

245
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:39,312
No. I've never seen him before.

246
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,482
No.

247
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,287
He's the father of my child,

248
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:49,455
and he's a police officer,

249
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:52,192
so if I were you people, I'd...

250
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,321
_

251
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:05,570
I don't understand the question.

252
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:10,769
_

253
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:12,844
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

254
00:14:12,846 --> 00:14:14,846
Who am I talking to?

255
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:16,957
Why don't you show yourself?

256
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:19,283
_ Look.

257
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:22,553
I just take care of my son all day.

258
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:25,522
My specialty is mac and cheese.

259
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:41,905
He's with his father today.

260
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,208
Don't you hurt him!

261
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:49,078
Don't you dare hurt him!

262
00:14:58,224 --> 00:15:00,089
If that child

263
00:15:00,091 --> 00:15:01,723
is harmed

264
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:03,724
in any way...

265
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,761
I will hunt you down...

266
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:08,897
whoever you are,

267
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:11,132
whenever you are...

268
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,383
And I will kill you.

269
00:15:18,238 --> 00:15:20,238
_

270
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,094
Hey.

271
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:04,048
Sorry to interrupt.

272
00:16:04,127 --> 00:16:05,387
There's someone here
who'd like to see you.

273
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:06,728
A David Mailer?

274
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,028
Who?

275
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,545
"A mutual friend of Marcy," he said.

276
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,065
Sorry. I can send him away.

277
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,800
He gave me the impression
that you knew each other.

278
00:16:12,802 --> 00:16:14,469
No, no, that's... uh, send him in.

279
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:27,581
David Mailer, sir.

280
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,948
- Thanks, Beth.
- Hi.

281
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,011
David Mailer.

282
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,420
She just... said that.

283
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:36,389
So FBI headquarters, huh?

284
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:39,425
It's a field office.
Uh, h-h-ow did you...?

285
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:40,660
Uh, the address

286
00:16:40,662 --> 00:16:41,772
was on the...

287
00:16:42,497 --> 00:16:44,062
the card that you gave me.

288
00:16:44,064 --> 00:16:45,364
I gave you?

289
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:46,732
Yeah, well, you slipped it under my door

290
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:48,404
when I was out a while back.

291
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,636
We spoke on the phone later that night.

292
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:52,271
You don't remember.

293
00:16:52,273 --> 00:16:55,307
- No.
- How do I know this Marcy person?

294
00:16:57,744 --> 00:16:59,210
Well, I kinda know

295
00:16:59,212 --> 00:17:01,413
that she works with you, so, um...

296
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:03,515
Well, obviously, I can neither
confirm nor deny that.

297
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:06,284
Which is cool, and I totally get that,

298
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:08,019
and I know that what
you're doing is very important,

299
00:17:08,021 --> 00:17:09,321
and... she really hasn't mentioned me?

300
00:17:09,323 --> 00:17:11,155
The point of this visit is?

301
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:13,690
Marcy didn't come home last night.

302
00:17:14,026 --> 00:17:15,759
Not "home" home.

303
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:17,574
She's just... she's staying
with me platonically,

304
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:18,874
but I was expecting her for dinner.

305
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:20,531
W-When did you last see her?

306
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:23,200
Yesterday morning, when she left.

307
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:24,335
I'm sure she's on

308
00:17:24,337 --> 00:17:28,038
some sort of secret FBI medical thing,

309
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,339
but I was worried

310
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,807
and I just wanted
to hear from you that...

311
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:31,808
Okay.

312
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,142
Um, I'm gonna look into this.

313
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:34,811
Why don't you leave
your number with Beth,

314
00:17:34,813 --> 00:17:36,046
and I'll give you
a call if I find anything.

315
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:37,299
Wait. You don't know
where she is either?

316
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:39,119
Beth? Beth,
can you please take Mr. Mailer's

317
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:41,126
contact information? Thank you.

318
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,412
Uh...

319
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,855
Marcy, it's MacLaren.

320
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:49,858
Carly?

321
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:53,601
Trevor? Philip?

322
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:56,540
Shit.

323
00:18:03,873 --> 00:18:06,073
Now exhale.

324
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:09,932
Feel the silence between your breaths.

325
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:13,596
Your heart beating in your chest.

326
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:16,684
Constant as the reactor beneath.

327
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:19,918
Giving light.

328
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:22,355
Heat.

329
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:24,391
Time.

330
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,372
Philip!

331
00:18:40,374 --> 00:18:41,373
Oh, thank God!

332
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:43,325
I thought I was alone.

333
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:46,879
I'm really gonna take it personally

334
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,881
if you don't pick me next time.

335
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:01,363
Hey. Did you see Carly?
They just left with her.

336
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:03,088
I woke up in an empty room

337
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,095
and they brought me here.

338
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:07,698
I don't even know how long I was there.

339
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,900
Hours?

340
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:10,307
Wait. Are you hurt?

341
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:12,105
Thanks to John Hentrick, no.

342
00:19:17,063 --> 00:19:21,110
Inventor of airbags, 1952.

343
00:19:22,632 --> 00:19:24,414
But I am hurting in other ways.

344
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,749
Withdrawal.

345
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:27,150
I haven't been able to go

346
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:30,385
more than 18 hours between doses
since we got here,

347
00:19:30,387 --> 00:19:33,622
and I can pretty much tell you,
without looking at a clock,

348
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:35,925
we're coming up on that number.

349
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:44,232
Not the rehab facility
I thought that I'd end up in.

350
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:46,801
Marcy and I were meditating.

351
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,937
You should, too.

352
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:52,472
There's no way...

353
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:54,264
Trust me, Philip.

354
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:56,177
It'll help.

355
00:19:57,454 --> 00:19:58,554
I promise.

356
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,387
Now exhale.

357
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,190
You're the one who told me

358
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:12,085
to take the red flag off
these same four people.

359
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,477
Well, now there's
no sign of any sign of them.

360
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:14,518
One of them might be missing.

361
00:20:14,543 --> 00:20:15,742
Just do it, please.

362
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,233
I'll put in the request,

363
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:18,490
but even a priority
facial recognition search

364
00:20:18,515 --> 00:20:20,081
isn't likely to turn up anything.

365
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:22,140
Let's try to be a little more
positive, shall we?

366
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:23,631
Okay, sure, I'm positive

367
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,812
that I'm the one they're gonna
complain to for using up

368
00:20:25,837 --> 00:20:27,203
NSA mainframe time

369
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:28,928
on something you called a false alarm.

370
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,014
Jesus! David.
What are you doing out here?

371
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,131
Just waiting to hear
if you've got anything yet.

372
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:39,484
Well, in the 11 minutes
since you left my office?

373
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,987
No. I have employed resources.

374
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:43,054
Like?

375
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:44,656
If Marcy's face shows up

376
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:47,058
practically anywhere there's
a closed-circuit TV camera,

377
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,560
we'll know her location.

378
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,495
Great. Tell me how I can help.

379
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:51,796
You can go home.

380
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:53,531
Oh, my God. You're just like her.

381
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:54,865
Would you stop? You know what?

382
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:55,866
I'm gonna help you out,

383
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:57,343
whether you like it or not.
How about that?

384
00:20:57,368 --> 00:20:59,570
What're you gonna do,
follow me on your bike?

385
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:00,738
Ah-hah!

386
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,939
She did tell you about me.

387
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,241
You just gave it all away.

388
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:05,709
You know I have a bike.

389
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,945
Your right pant leg
is tucked into your sock.

390
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,613
I was giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

391
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,850
Okay, I get it.

392
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:16,052
I'm not qualified, but just know this...

393
00:21:16,054 --> 00:21:18,759
Marcy's welfare is very important to me.

394
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:20,418
When I find her, I'll call you.

395
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:22,127
Or better still...

396
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,659
she'll just come home.

397
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:26,474
Okay, so if I don't hear
from you by what, like, 5:00...

398
00:21:42,713 --> 00:21:44,144
I'm getting the feeling

399
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:45,780
we're not gonna make our next mission.

400
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:48,916
That is the least

401
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:51,318
of my problems right now.

402
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,489
Come on, Philip.
You're stronger than that.

403
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:55,514
You have no idea what this feels like,

404
00:21:55,604 --> 00:21:57,152
so why don't you...

405
00:22:17,345 --> 00:22:19,645
I can't see.

406
00:22:21,482 --> 00:22:23,448
I can't see!

407
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:38,009
Really?

408
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:41,866
You're gonna pass over me again?

409
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:44,301
How many of them are there?

410
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:45,503
What did they do?

411
00:22:45,505 --> 00:22:47,338
Just the one you've already met.

412
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,373
There was an old-style television

413
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:52,109
in an open space, like a warehouse.

414
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:53,110
In this building?

415
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:54,111
Must be.

416
00:22:54,113 --> 00:22:56,113
Then they asked questions.

417
00:22:56,115 --> 00:22:58,715
Just words on the television.

418
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:01,384
"When are you from?"

419
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:05,335
Shit.

420
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:08,191
They know.

421
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:10,092
No. There's nothing to know.

422
00:23:10,094 --> 00:23:11,794
Well, they obviously know something.

423
00:23:11,796 --> 00:23:12,895
They have Jeffrey.

424
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:14,381
- What?
- My son.

425
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:17,999
They showed him to me on the television.

426
00:23:18,024 --> 00:23:19,023
They have him.

427
00:23:19,137 --> 00:23:20,136
I saw.

428
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,244
Uh, wha...

429
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:31,813
Whoa, whoa. Guys?

430
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,049
What's he doing?

431
00:23:34,773 --> 00:23:37,052
He's injecting something
into your I.V. line.

432
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:38,252
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

433
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:39,921
Uh, what, uh...

434
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:42,462
I...

435
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:49,997
Never mind.

436
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:53,521
No. No-no-no!
Stop, stop. That's too much.

437
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:56,046
No! Stop! He'll overdose! Stop!

438
00:23:56,931 --> 00:23:58,072
That's okay.

439
00:23:58,074 --> 00:23:59,939
It's what I needed.

440
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:00,963
That amount of heroin

441
00:24:00,988 --> 00:24:02,709
will slow your respiration rate
and your heart rate

442
00:24:02,711 --> 00:24:04,043
down to dangerous levels. Philip?

443
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,790
You need to stay with us, okay?

444
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:08,398
- I'm here.
- Philip, stay awake.

445
00:24:08,562 --> 00:24:10,597
Philip! Listen to Marcy!

446
00:24:11,712 --> 00:24:13,846
I can hear you, I'm...

447
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:15,788
Philip. No. No, no!

448
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,723
No! No! No! Philip!

449
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:19,424
Carly! Make sure he stays awake!

450
00:24:19,426 --> 00:24:21,927
Philip, you stay awake, okay?

451
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,642
Hello?

452
00:24:52,173 --> 00:24:54,050
My name is Marcy Warton.

453
00:24:55,053 --> 00:24:57,053
I work at a library.

454
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:58,988
I don't know why you've taken me here.

455
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,790
I haven't done anything wrong.

456
00:25:04,662 --> 00:25:08,063
Hello? Marcy! Yes.

457
00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:10,599
Oh, thank God. I was so worried.

458
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:12,864
I've been freaking out.

459
00:25:13,937 --> 00:25:16,138
No. No, I get it. Yeah. Mum's the word.

460
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,131
Yeah, no, of course,
you're... you're busy.

461
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:21,309
Okay. Well, when you do, I'll be here.

462
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,346
Yeah, all right, yeah.
We'll have the chicken.

463
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:28,783
Yeah, chicken sounds good.
I can't wait. Okay.

464
00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,688
Yeah. Bye-bye.

465
00:25:39,394 --> 00:25:40,544
Philip!

466
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,030
Philip, you do not
have permission to sleep!

467
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:45,799
We asked you a question!

468
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:47,801
I'm still here.

469
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:49,135
Good. That's good.

470
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:50,770
Talk to us.

471
00:25:50,772 --> 00:25:53,607
Tell us about your parents.
Where do they live?

472
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:55,341
Yeah. You never talk about them.

473
00:25:56,183 --> 00:25:57,343
What's your mother's name?

474
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:00,725
2144.

475
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:03,182
Stay in the here and now, Philip...

476
00:26:03,184 --> 00:26:05,685
Do you remember
the taste of the water?

477
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:06,852
Recycled so many times

478
00:26:06,854 --> 00:26:08,487
it could never be made pure again?

479
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:09,622
Shut up!

480
00:26:09,624 --> 00:26:10,690
This can't be heroin.

481
00:26:10,692 --> 00:26:11,924
No, no, no, it is.

482
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:14,226
Or at least the first one was,

483
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:19,564
and I am more grateful for it
than I care to admit,

484
00:26:19,566 --> 00:26:21,463
but the second one was something else.

485
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:24,536
Something I think would only work

486
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:27,372
on someone who's been modified
to be an historian.

487
00:26:27,374 --> 00:26:28,540
What is it?

488
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:32,543
Memory...

489
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:35,579
pouring in like a flood.

490
00:26:35,952 --> 00:26:38,181
Like the Helios tidal wave.

491
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:42,986
I can't stop it.

492
00:26:43,748 --> 00:26:44,796
I'm drowning in it!

493
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:46,856
I want you to breathe deeply

494
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:50,426
- and listen to my voice...
- You can't compete with this.

495
00:26:55,458 --> 00:26:58,200
Do you remember
the taste of metal in the air?

496
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:02,104
The stink of 20,000 souls

497
00:27:02,106 --> 00:27:05,874
crammed into a shelter
designed for half that number?

498
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,277
Don't talk about the past!

499
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,011
You mean the future.

500
00:27:10,013 --> 00:27:11,513
I mean stop talking.

501
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:13,848
Do you guys remember
when the reveille bell rang

502
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,084
at the exact moment

503
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:18,853
the dome in shelter 41 collapsed?

504
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,122
It was exactly at 0600...

505
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:25,125
almost like cause and effect.

506
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:28,228
The bell rang

507
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:29,863
and woke everyone up

508
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:32,700
a split second before they died.

509
00:27:36,895 --> 00:27:39,706
As a boy, I remember thinking,

510
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,709
"That's so unfair."

511
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:47,681
Philip, keep your mouth shut.

512
00:27:47,683 --> 00:27:49,949
I'm not sure that I can.

513
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:52,251
Philip...

514
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,486
Philip!

515
00:27:53,488 --> 00:27:54,653
I'll try.

516
00:27:54,655 --> 00:27:55,921
Philip. Philip?

517
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:58,256
I'll try. I'll try. I'll try, I'll try.

518
00:27:58,258 --> 00:27:59,257
Philip!

519
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:02,093
I'll try, I'll try...

520
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:03,895
Philip?

521
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:04,963
Philip!

522
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:13,381
Philip?

523
00:28:17,944 --> 00:28:19,662
Philip?

524
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,701
Where are you guys?

525
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,208
"No battle
plan survives contact... "

526
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,643
"Plans are useless."

527
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,779
"...You are planning to fail."

528
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:58,280
- "...Planning is indispensable."
- ...Franklin. Franklin...

529
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:02,550
"If you fail to plan,
you are planning to fail."

530
00:29:02,552 --> 00:29:05,152
Benjamin Franklin.

531
00:29:08,091 --> 00:29:09,991
"No battle plan..."

532
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:11,259
Battle plan...

533
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:13,194
"...survives contact with the enemy."

534
00:29:13,196 --> 00:29:15,930
Helmuth Von Moltke.

535
00:29:18,334 --> 00:29:19,433
"My mission..."

536
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:21,034
"...in life

537
00:29:21,036 --> 00:29:23,570
is not merely to survive,
but to thrive..."

538
00:29:23,572 --> 00:29:24,772
To thrive.

539
00:29:24,774 --> 00:29:27,007
"And to do so with some passion...

540
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:29,209
"passion, some compassion,

541
00:29:29,211 --> 00:29:31,011
some humor, and some style!"

542
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:32,871
Maya Angelou!

543
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:35,248
"This is the way the world ends..."

544
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,616
This is the way the world ends.

545
00:29:36,618 --> 00:29:38,885
"This is the way the world ends."

546
00:29:38,887 --> 00:29:40,953
"This is the way

547
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:43,289
the world ends."

548
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:45,792
"This is the way the world ends."

549
00:29:45,794 --> 00:29:47,184
"This is the way the world ends..."

550

00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:50,062
"...Not with a bang..."

552
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,965
"...but a whimper."

553
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,500
T.S.

556
00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:10,749
***

557
00:30:10,796 --> 00:30:12,196
Well, it's a start.

558
00:30:12,198 --> 00:30:13,597
What about 911 records?

559
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:14,674
E.M.T. calls?

560
00:30:14,676 --> 00:30:16,699
Nothing. I've also tried
virtually every emergency room

561
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:18,134
in the Pacific Northwest.

562
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:19,969
You sure you don't want me
to call Agent Forbes?

563
00:30:19,971 --> 00:30:21,104
No, he's got enough

564
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:22,105
on his plate.

565
00:30:22,107 --> 00:30:23,139
Well, it's just that he asked me

566
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:24,507
to keep him updated on everything.

567
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:25,774
I said that I was sure, Beth.
How many freaking times

568
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:27,421
do you need me to say it?

569
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,280
Sorry. I'm having a bad day.

570
00:30:31,282 --> 00:30:33,548
Well, now we all are.

571
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,650
Just let me know if you find anything.

572
00:30:36,411 --> 00:30:38,353
Okay.

573
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:49,331
Oh, ho, ho! Come on!

574
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,434
Finally!

575
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,836
I've really been looking forward
to this, Mr. Giant.

576
00:30:55,838 --> 00:30:57,671
Thank you so-o-o much.

577
00:30:58,085 --> 00:31:00,707
Ha-hah!

578
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:04,078
I just hate being the last guy
picked, you know?

579
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,579
Drives me crazy.

580
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,514
I'm sure a guy like you understands.

581
00:31:07,516 --> 00:31:09,549
Back soon!

582
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,723
All right, all right!

583
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:19,725
Hey-hey.

584
00:31:20,017 --> 00:31:22,862
Freight elevator. Sweet ride.

585
00:31:26,548 --> 00:31:28,200
Hey, are we going up or down?

586
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:30,241
I'm gonna guess down.

587
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:34,084
Up! You son of a bitch! You got me!

588
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:45,391
Can I help you?

589
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:47,185
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.
I'm with the FBI.

590
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:48,352
I'm looking for a silver van

591
00:31:48,354 --> 00:31:49,687
that was brought here yesterday,

592
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:51,055
about 3:30 in the afternoon.

593
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:53,391
Oh, the one that got T-boned
by the Peterbilt?

594
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:55,460
T-boned by the Pe...?

595
00:31:55,462 --> 00:31:57,027
Yeah. Sure. Show me.

596
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:58,295
Uh...

597
00:31:58,297 --> 00:32:00,550
Hey, FBI doing traffic accidents now?

598
00:32:00,575 --> 00:32:01,545
No.

599
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,332
Well, what's this about?

600
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:03,733
It's about you showing me the van,

601
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:05,135
and not asking me
anymore goddamn questions.

602
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:06,470
Oh. 'Kay.

603
00:32:07,521 --> 00:32:08,553
There she is.

604
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:09,673
Total write-off.

605
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:18,947
Do you know if any of
the occupants were badly hurt?

606
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:20,782
Oh, we don't get reports
on the incidents.

607
00:32:20,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Uh, the airbags went off,
I can tell you that.

608
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:29,134
Okay. Thanks for your time.

609
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,359
Uh, you wanna dust it for prints

610
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,384
or hit it with a little
blue light or nothin'?

611
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,873
Knock yourself out.

612
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:36,964
Wow!

613
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:38,566
This is great up here.

614
00:32:38,568 --> 00:32:41,269
Nice big space, daylight.

615
00:32:44,932 --> 00:32:47,175
That's a big old CRT.

616
00:32:47,177 --> 00:32:48,776
I'm guessing...

617
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:50,661
late '90s.

618
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,751
Those flat-screen
sons of guns are heavy, huh?

619
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,565
Probably not so much for you.

620
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,522
I bet you didn't even need
help from your friends.

621
00:33:01,524 --> 00:33:03,290
You do have friends, right?

622
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,293
Are they government,

623
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:08,927
or is this a private contractor gig?

624
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:16,127
Whoa, a question on the TV! I love it.

625
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:18,304
It's like that show my mom
watches after supper.

626
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:21,683
You know, most people would ask
"Where are you from?"

627
00:33:21,685 --> 00:33:23,084
But hey, I don't want to offend anybody,

628
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,951
if English is a second language.

629
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:26,653
Maybe it's a typo, huh?

630
00:33:29,694 --> 00:33:31,062
_

631
00:33:31,087 --> 00:33:33,160
What a coincidence! I was gonna
ask you the same thing,

632
00:33:33,162 --> 00:33:36,163
since you're the ones
who brought me here, but hey,

633
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:38,298
like my humanities teacher,
Mr. Warchowski, says...

634
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,033
"Why are we all here?" Right?

635
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,790
_

636
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:45,805
Guess.

637
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:51,577
'Kay, technically,
I'll be 18 in October,

638
00:33:51,579 --> 00:33:53,378
but I'm kind of an old soul.

639
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,647
What about you, Mr. Giant?
When's your birthday?

640
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,053
Back when I was starting quarterback,

641
00:34:02,055 --> 00:34:03,387
our mission was to win the division,

642
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:04,655
obviously.

643
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:06,024
You look like you played a little ball

644
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:07,152
in your day, Mr. Giant.

645
00:34:08,016 --> 00:34:09,404
Then again...

646
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,389
a deaf-mute like yourself

647
00:34:13,493 --> 00:34:16,536
wouldn't be able to hear
the quarterback call plays,

648
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:18,368
would he?

649
00:34:20,472 --> 00:34:21,671
Ho-ho!

650
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:27,344
I'll catch you later, man!

651
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:33,716
What did you say to them?

652
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,212
I got 'em right where I want 'em.

653
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,475
Excuse me.

654
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:45,261
Officer Boyd?

655
00:34:45,263 --> 00:34:46,562
You got a second?

656
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:48,964
Sure. Excuse me.

657
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:55,436
What about the, uh...

658
00:34:55,438 --> 00:34:56,638
The CCTV is down.

659
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,705
What the hell are you doing here?

660
00:34:57,956 --> 00:34:59,141
I thought I made it very clear last time

661
00:34:59,143 --> 00:35:00,708
that you were not
to communicate with me.

662
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,110
Yeah, well, screw Protocol 6.

663
00:35:02,112 --> 00:35:03,145
My team is missing.

664
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:04,880
For how long?

665
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:06,280
Since yesterday morning.

666
00:35:06,282 --> 00:35:08,115
Apparently. I just found out
about it a while ago.

667
00:35:08,117 --> 00:35:10,450
All of them! Their coms
and locators are offline.

668
00:35:10,452 --> 00:35:11,752
They don't show up on GPS.

669
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:13,008
What about the deep web backchannel?

670
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:14,356
That's the first place I looked!

671
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:16,556
There's no sign of them.
It's like they've disappeared.

672
00:35:16,558 --> 00:35:18,453
The FBI has far more
resources than I do.

673
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:20,127
I'm running a facial recognition search

674
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:21,218
through the NSA.

675
00:35:21,243 --> 00:35:22,862
Which could take forever,
if it works at all.

676
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:24,330
I know! But what else can I do?

677
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:25,871
They've all been
previously red-flagged...

678
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,801
by the previous me.

679
00:35:27,803 --> 00:35:29,769
I found their vehicle
in... in a salvage yard.

680
00:35:29,771 --> 00:35:32,037
It had been T-boned by a Vanderbilt...

681
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,182
or some damn thing.

682
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:34,797
Trail ends there, I'm guessing?

683
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:38,611
Okay, you need to
consider the possibility

684
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:40,524
that they've been taken
out of the equation.

685
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:41,815
What equation?

686
00:35:42,538 --> 00:35:44,183
The Director's.

687
00:35:44,863 --> 00:35:46,136
I've seen entire teams

688
00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:48,420
I was supposed to work
on a mission with just disappear

689
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:49,417
into thin air.

690
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:50,989
Probably taken out
by another traveler team

691
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:52,424
under orders.

692
00:35:52,641 --> 00:35:54,193
You know as well as I do,

693
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,794
the future has
the ultimate power over us.

694
00:35:55,796 --> 00:35:57,461
If the Director doesn't
like the way we perform,

695
00:35:57,463 --> 00:35:58,462
a decision we make...

696
00:35:58,464 --> 00:35:59,463
W-W-Why them?

697
00:35:59,465 --> 00:36:00,631
I'm responsible for my team's actions.

698
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:01,999
Well, how badly

699
00:36:02,001 --> 00:36:03,534
have you messed up lately?
Maybe you're next.

700
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,430
I don't buy that.

701
00:36:06,772 --> 00:36:08,172
What do you want from me?

702
00:36:08,174 --> 00:36:10,241
My team has been tasked
to participate in a mission

703
00:36:10,243 --> 00:36:12,343
that requires six people,
minimum, to pull it off.

704
00:36:12,345 --> 00:36:13,711
- When?
- Tonight.

705
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,845
And that's what you're here about?

706
00:36:14,847 --> 00:36:15,879
You want my team's help?

707
00:36:15,881 --> 00:36:17,347
The mission comes first.

708
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,548
The mission's canceled, MacLaren!

709
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,515
You just don't get it yet.

710
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:22,018
Thanks for your help.

711
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,053
Hold on.

712
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:26,296
If you get a real lead,

713
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,225
I will help you go after them.

714
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,492
Okay? I'll help you.

715
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:30,807
But if I'm right,
and it's the Director...

716
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:31,774
I know.

717
00:36:32,463 --> 00:36:33,462
I hope I'm wrong.

718
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,404
Torture doesn't work, people.

719
00:36:42,406 --> 00:36:43,638
It's been proven!

720
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,707
You know, whoever you are,

721
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,709
whatever information
you think you're getting

722
00:36:47,711 --> 00:36:50,478
is of almost no value.

723
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,530
_

724
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:03,070
Philip.

725
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,957
His name is Philip.

726
00:37:07,015 --> 00:37:08,896
He was in the van with me
when we were...

727
00:37:10,593 --> 00:37:11,881
_

728
00:37:14,169 --> 00:37:16,569
I don't understand the question.

729
00:37:16,571 --> 00:37:17,570
I mean, if you're asking how old...

730
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:21,341
No! No!

731
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,459
Where's the rest of your team?

732
00:38:10,461 --> 00:38:11,360
M.I.A.!

733
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:12,674
We have to cancel the mission.

734
00:38:12,676 --> 00:38:13,875
What about all those people?

735
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,309
I was hoping the Director

736
00:38:15,311 --> 00:38:17,178
would send you
a replacement team, but...

737
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,680
Maybe there's still a way.

738
00:38:18,682 --> 00:38:20,314
No, no. Forget it,
the mission's canceled.

739
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:21,883
The Director will have an alternative.

740
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:22,917
We have to trust that.

741
00:38:24,222 --> 00:38:25,686
I'm sorry about your team.

742
00:38:25,688 --> 00:38:27,821
I haven't given up just yet.

743
00:38:48,182 --> 00:38:49,281
There's no way they can do the mission

744
00:38:49,306 --> 00:38:51,306
with so few personnel.

745
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,381
All those people are gonna die.

746
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:57,877
They already did.

747
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:00,719
We just weren't there
to prevent it from happening.

748
00:39:02,503 --> 00:39:04,756
Just hope the boss
isn't in the same situation

749
00:39:04,758 --> 00:39:06,057
as we are somewhere.

750
00:39:06,317 --> 00:39:08,793
I have an idea that could end this,

751
00:39:08,795 --> 00:39:11,229
if the opportunity
presents itself again.

752
00:39:12,465 --> 00:39:14,232
But I want everyone to decide.

753
00:39:14,735 --> 00:39:16,767
We may not be better off.

754
00:39:18,037 --> 00:39:19,570
I say go for it.

755
00:39:19,572 --> 00:39:20,938
How?

756
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,406
You're gonna try to talk me out of it.

757
00:39:22,408 --> 00:39:23,541
Why?

758
00:39:23,543 --> 00:39:24,942
It's insane.

759
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:32,597
Marcy!

760
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:34,487
Philip? You're alive?

761
00:39:37,488 --> 00:39:39,923
I saw... I saw you die, they showed me.

762
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:42,625
- No, I'm right here.
- No, on the television. They...

763
00:39:42,627 --> 00:39:44,293
They shot you in the chest.

764
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:45,595
No, no, no, no, Marcy, Marcy,

765
00:39:45,597 --> 00:39:47,263
he's right in front of you.

766
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:48,403
Marcy, look at me.

767
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:50,933
You were in those clothes,
you were slumped over...

768
00:39:50,935 --> 00:39:52,133
Oh, this is good.

769
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:53,268
What? How?

770
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,736
Think about it!

771
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:56,905
They probably don't even
have Carly's kid!

772
00:39:56,907 --> 00:39:59,507
They're just pushing buttons
and seeing what happens.

773
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:00,909
I don't know who,

774
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:02,644
but this still gives us power
we don't have much of.

775
00:40:02,646 --> 00:40:03,779
We don't have any power.

776
00:40:05,649 --> 00:40:07,282
Please?

777
00:40:07,735 --> 00:40:09,083
Please...

778
00:40:09,531 --> 00:40:11,986
Before you take him away, would you...?

779
00:40:26,835 --> 00:40:28,001
Hang on!

780
00:42:35,824 --> 00:42:38,091
Jesus Christ!

781
00:42:46,292 --> 00:42:47,665
He's alive.

782
00:42:47,667 --> 00:42:48,800
He's cold. Dead for hours.

783
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:49,901
I've gotta get 'em out of here.

784
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:54,472
Look for a key! Check his pockets!

785
00:42:56,244 --> 00:42:58,008
- I got it! I got it!
- Got it?

786
00:43:08,988 --> 00:43:10,955
Carly!

787
00:43:11,991 --> 00:43:13,423
Carly.

788
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,125
She's unconscious,
but strong pulse, though.

789
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:17,761
It's me. I'm here.

790
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:19,195
You're late.

791
00:43:19,918 --> 00:43:21,164
Won't happen again.

792
00:43:21,166 --> 00:43:23,166
Gonna get you outta here, okay?

793
00:43:23,168 --> 00:43:25,034
How many days?

794
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:26,602
Three.

795
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,704
I had to end it.

796
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:29,873
What... What was this about?

797
00:43:29,875 --> 00:43:31,274
Why did he do it?

798
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,008
It wasn't him. He was a hired gun.

799
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,609
We never found out who it was.

800
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,129
I'm gonna get you out of this.

801
00:43:36,131 --> 00:43:37,512
Wait. What about the mission?

802
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:39,347
No, it's canceled.

803
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:40,615
Couldn't do it without you.

804
00:43:40,617 --> 00:43:41,616
There was no way.

805
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,154
What? What is it?

806
00:43:47,382 --> 00:43:50,224
What if that's what this was about?

807
00:43:58,823 --> 00:44:07,201
