00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,773
Previously on Travelers.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,874
Trading one addiction
for another never works.

3
00:00:04,876 --> 00:00:06,475
Are you prepared to do the work?

4
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:08,019
I have no intention
of playing football again.

5
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:09,505
- What?
- Trevor!

6
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:10,879
Imagine someone treating it like that,

7
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:13,248
not knowing what they have.

8
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,017
This is the mission objective

9
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,985
that motivated us
to come back to the 21st.

10
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:18,353
Armed.

11
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:19,655
We are seeing this through,

12
00:00:19,657 --> 00:00:22,223
to the end, if necessary.

13
00:00:25,728 --> 00:00:27,194
How will we know if it worked?

14
00:00:27,196 --> 00:00:29,830
I'm not sure it did.
We're all still here.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,399
Bought something to toast with.

16
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:34,601
Figured we should celebrate
21st-century style.

17
00:00:35,217 --> 00:00:37,437
The 21st century doesn't
even know we saved them.

18
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,373
Well, there'd be a lot of this
if they did.

19
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:41,626
You know, a lot of
people died. We should...

20
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:43,899
Because of them, a hell of a lot
more people are gonna live.

21
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,447
91,462,000 more.

22
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:50,651
It worked.

23
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:53,553
In 18 months, Helios is gonna miss.

24
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:55,288
Isn't that worth taking a moment?

25
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,422
Yeah.

26
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:58,580
Yeah, sure. I just...

27
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:02,194
I never thought past the mission.

28
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,337
You know?

29
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,597
I mean, the authorities can call it

30
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,099
a chemical explosion all they want,

31
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,366
but the Russians, the Chinese,

32
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,568
they've got satellites.

33
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,970
They're gonna know it was
an antimatter detonation.

34
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,505
T-This could end up

35
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,141
in the same arms race that
we came here to prevent in the...

36
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,975
Boss...

37
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:18,876
take the win.

38
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,879
All right. Ahem.

39
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,950
Anybody else's arm killing them?

40
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,351
I told you

41
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,787
the inoculation might
have some side effects.

42
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,336
How about a toast?

43
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,840
You know I'm not big
on speeches, so, um...

44
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,921
May you all live long lives.

45
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:42,356
Cheers.

46
00:01:42,357 --> 00:01:44,701
Prost, salut, viva, bud'mo, skol.

47
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:46,636
L'Chaim!

48
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:50,979
Oh, God.

49
00:01:50,981 --> 00:01:52,474
Oh, that's just wrong.

50
00:01:52,476 --> 00:01:54,176
Ugh.

51
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:55,611
I'm sorry, guys.

52
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,313
I only had $20 on me.

53
00:01:58,315 --> 00:01:59,615
I really...

54
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:03,218
And when you say
"may you all have long lives,"

55
00:02:03,888 --> 00:02:06,065
that kinda sounds like there
won't be any more missions.

56
00:02:07,374 --> 00:02:10,358
Well, we may have done
what we came here to do...

57
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,762
created a future
where we're no longer needed.

58
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:17,598
All we have to do is...

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,497
live out our lives.

60
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:22,170
These lives, I mean.

61
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:23,972
Protocol 5.

62
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:26,673
Indefinitely.

64
00:04:33,004 --> 00:04:34,110
Afternoon.

65
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:35,479
Come with me.

66
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:39,867
What's up?

67
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:44,053
This has always been solid, right?

68
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,255
Between me and you.

69
00:04:45,771 --> 00:04:46,889
Are you breaking up with me?

70
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:48,525
No, I'm serious, man, I'm in trouble.

71
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:49,526
What kind of trouble?

72
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:50,726
What you got on this afternoon?

73
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:51,961
More of that.

74
00:04:51,963 --> 00:04:53,384
Not anymore. I need your help.

75
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:55,231
Well, tell me what's going on!

76
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,132
You've been dropping off the grid

77
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,333
left and right lately,

78
00:04:57,335 --> 00:04:59,421
and I haven't asked one single question.

79
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,693
Now, you're my partner, right?
And I trust you.

80
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,572
Do you trust me?

81
00:05:04,148 --> 00:05:05,440
Of course I do.

82
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,376
All right. Let's go.

83
00:05:34,573 --> 00:05:36,573
_

84
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:50,929
It's okay. It's okay.

85
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,864
I know. I know.

86
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:54,065
It's okay. It's okay.

87
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:57,101
It's okay.

88
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:04,509
I really don't know
how you stand this either.

89
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:08,505
_

90
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,888
_

91
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:50,419
None of this fits.

92
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:51,858
I think I'm getting fat.

93
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,921
I don't think you understand

94
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,217
the meaning of the word.

95
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:56,824
Well, either I'm getting fat

96
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:58,225
or my boobs got bigger.

97
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:00,760
Can you come in here a sec?

98
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:02,329
Actually, no, I don't
think that's a good idea.

99
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:03,631
I'm not supposed to...

100
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:05,132
Come in here. I need your help.

101
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:06,267
Rene, the lady's right there,

102
00:09:06,269 --> 00:09:08,969
- and she could...
- Okay.

103
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:12,740
Look at all this stuff.
I've got so much good shit.

104
00:09:12,742 --> 00:09:14,107
Look at this. Open back.

105
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:15,308
Mm-hmm.

106
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,510
And these pants. Aren't they perfect?

107
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:18,344
Yeah, they're really pants.

108
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:19,679
'Kay. Open your coat.

109
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:20,680
- What?
- We got to go.

110
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:21,948
Open your coat!

111
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,249
I can't fit this all in my purse.

112
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,284
You don't actually, um,

113
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:25,652
want to steal all this stuff?

114
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:27,487
Well, not all of it.

115
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:30,890
Rene, don't.

116
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:33,125
Come on! You love this stuff!

117
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:34,427
Help me.

118
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:36,529
Do you have these in a size 13?

119
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:37,863
It's hard for me to find good shoes.

120
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:40,299
I really like these kicks.

121
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:42,701
Do you think you could
maybe take a look,

122
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:43,736
like, in the back?

123
00:09:43,738 --> 00:09:46,723
In the back. Sure.

124
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,609
I thought this stuff got you hot.

125
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:52,477
Come on. It gets me hot.

126
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:54,045
Come on, look, Rene,

127
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:57,231
I'm gonna have to admit a bit of
confusion at this point, okay?

128
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:58,799
Hey! That's illegal!

129
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:00,116
So's that.

130
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:02,229
- Hey!
- Hey! Wait!

131
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:03,109
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

132
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:04,822
The Director's gonna
make you pay for this.

133
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:06,890
Excuse me?

134
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:08,425
You're paying for what they stole.

135
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:23,739
Aw, shit.

136
00:10:26,744 --> 00:10:28,344
Hey, Phil. Phil?

137
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:35,184
Hey, Phil.

138
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:38,087
Come on, man. Don't make me chase you.

139
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,415
What's up?

140
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:42,843
I thought you were off of that shit.

141
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,539
What am I, getting you
the Percs just for show?

142
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,898
What do you want, Ray?

143
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:52,066
Why don't you let me take you home?

144
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,067
Come on, man.

145
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,402
I'm going for a walk.

146
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,269
Yeah. I can see that.

147
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:57,805
Don't have any bets for you today.

148
00:10:57,807 --> 00:10:59,450
Forget about the bet.

149
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:02,209
You're scaring the children.

150
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:03,477
Boo.

151
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:05,145
Sorry.

152
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:45,751
Come on, let's go.

153
00:11:46,063 --> 00:11:47,818
Walt, what are we doing?

154
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,188
- What is this?
- Just keep it reined in.

155
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,356
These guys don't mess around.

156
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:57,461
Stop where you are!

157
00:11:57,463 --> 00:11:59,096
Eyes front!

158
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:02,332
Put the bag down! Weapons down!
Put 'em on the ground!

159
00:12:02,334 --> 00:12:03,767
Okay, we're doing it!

160
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:04,989
Seriously?

161
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,937
It's gonna be all right.

162
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:11,875
Get your hands in the air.
Above your head!

163
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:13,357
Eyes front!

164
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:17,647
Sorry about that, Mac.

165
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:20,816
Let's go.

166
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:39,333
Surprise!

167
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,836
Easy there.

168
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:43,671
You son of a bitch.

169
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:44,906
You've got some new moves, Mac.

170
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:46,474
Jesus, man, I could've broken something.

171
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:47,976
Yeah, I'm fine.

172
00:12:47,978 --> 00:12:50,211
You still got no chill, man.

173
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:54,381
Congratulations, partner.

174
00:12:54,383 --> 00:12:56,401
Oh, and thanks for the assist
with the propane.

175
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,024
15 years and they can
still surprise you?

176
00:13:04,026 --> 00:13:06,059
Congratulations.

177
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:14,322
I swore to myself

178
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:16,327
I would never eat this shit again.

179
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,949
Well... the body needs fuel, man.

180
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:20,964
When was the last time
you had like a proper meal?

181
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,200
All I ever see you eat
is Coke and Twinkies.

182
00:13:24,202 --> 00:13:26,472
When did you start
caring about my health?

183
00:13:26,474 --> 00:13:28,515
You see, that's your
problem, right there.

184
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:30,573
Probably all you've ever had

185
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,641
is junkies for friends, right?

186
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,977
You never had anyone
just lookin' out for you

187
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:36,645
'cause they care.

188
00:13:36,647 --> 00:13:38,814
You only care because I give you bets.

189
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:40,783
Yeah, your special abilities,

190
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:43,985
they play a fundamental part
in our relationship,

191
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:45,486
that's for sure.

192
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,321
But I'm buying you lunch

193
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:49,457
'cause I'm a goddamn humanitarian.

194
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,359
Hey, Marce?

195
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:53,928
In here.

196
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,396
Hey, I couldn't remember

197
00:13:55,398 --> 00:13:57,832
if you liked the green apples
or the red apples, so I just...

198
00:13:57,834 --> 00:13:59,701
Jesus Christ.

199
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:02,836
What?

200
00:14:02,838 --> 00:14:04,170
What the hell are you doing?

201
00:14:04,172 --> 00:14:06,740
Uh, just a minor surgery.

202
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,076
Nothing serious.

203
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:10,911
What have you done to yourself?

204
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:14,715
I've installed a vagus nerve stimulator

205
00:14:14,717 --> 00:14:16,869
in order to minimize my seizures.

206
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:20,234
Normal people don't
operate on themselves, Marcy.

207
00:14:20,989 --> 00:14:22,698
The Terminator, maybe, but that's it.

208
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,556
This is minimally invasive.

209
00:14:24,558 --> 00:14:25,891
Don't worry, I'll clean up the mess.

210
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,660
It's not about the mess.

211
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:30,195
The fact that you would
do something like this alone

212
00:14:30,197 --> 00:14:32,064
is insane.

213
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:34,500
Well, you would've made me
go to the hospital.

214
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:36,567
Yes! Surgery?

215
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:38,937
Yes! I mean, look at this place!

216
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:42,055
It's just a little bit of blood.

217
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:44,575
No, it's not.

218
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:45,576
No, it's not! This...

219
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:47,545
This is a great deal of blood!

220
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:48,713
How... How do you not...

221
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:49,881
How do you not recognize this?

222
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:51,715
I mean...

223
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:55,052
Oh, come on! I can't...
I can't keep doing this.

224
00:14:55,054 --> 00:14:56,754
Doing what?

225
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,256
Pretending that this is normal.

226
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:02,158
And it's not just this, it's everything.

227
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,128
I mean, it's... it's the
staying out late all night

228
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,997
without telling me where you are,

229
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,764
it's CPR during phone conversations,

230
00:15:08,766 --> 00:15:10,799
it's the... how about
the phone message saying

231
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:12,200
that you might be relocating?

232
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,312
"Another time, another life"... what...

233
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:27,214
And please stop kissing me
to just to shut me up.

234
00:15:27,216 --> 00:15:28,809
That's not fair.

235
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:34,707
Do you want me to leave?

236
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,571
No.

237
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:40,995
No. It's... do you know what it is?

238
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:45,185
Stop trying to do everything alone.

239
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:47,133
Let me in.

240
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:50,480
Let me help you with the battle.

241
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,806
Because I can't help but think

242
00:15:52,808 --> 00:15:54,340
that whatever it is you're doing...

243
00:15:54,342 --> 00:15:56,009
it's a battle.

244
00:15:57,491 --> 00:15:58,612
Would you have helped me with this?

245
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:01,047
Oh, God, no. No.

246
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:02,347
But...

247
00:16:02,349 --> 00:16:03,683
I am here for you

248
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:06,285
for anything and everything
non-surgical.

249
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:11,419
Okay, maybe, like,
minor surgery, like...

250
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:13,619
Band-Aids.

251
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:16,995
I can do Band-Aids.

252
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,499
All right, get him up here.

253
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,147
Come on, let's go.

254
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,036
Yeah, get his jacket.

255
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:26,237
No...

256
00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:27,572
Take your jacket off.

257
00:16:27,574 --> 00:16:29,040
Come on, everyone,
let's hear it for him!

258
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,274
Why?

259
00:16:30,276 --> 00:16:32,510
Why are you taking my jacket?

260
00:16:32,512 --> 00:16:33,677
It's fine. You'll be fine.

261
00:16:35,782 --> 00:16:38,048
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

262
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,717
In recognition of your many years

263
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:41,585
of dedication to this Bureau,

264
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:43,153
the men and women of this division

265
00:16:43,155 --> 00:16:44,709
would like to present you with...

266
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:46,423
this token

267
00:16:46,425 --> 00:16:48,092
of our appreciation.

268
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,393
Here's to 15 years, bruh.

269
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,096
Come on! Hold it up.

270
00:16:55,734 --> 00:16:58,768
- What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no. Come on.

271
00:17:00,571 --> 00:17:01,704
Here we go.

272
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:06,709
Yo, Kat, take a picture.

273
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:08,510
Yeah. Of course.

274
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,913
I can't get in.

275
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:12,948
Just swipe up.

276
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,449
Did you... Did you change it?

277
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:20,889
All right. Let's do this.

278
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,047
Big smiles! Come on, man.

279
00:17:30,366 --> 00:17:32,099
Hey. It's okay.

280
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:35,435
We're just gonna play it
extra safe today, okay? Okay?

281
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:49,315
Shit.

282
00:17:58,493 --> 00:17:59,491
Hey, Walt.

283
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:00,759
Hey, sweetheart. How are you?

284
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:02,061
Mm. Good.

285
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:04,629
Thanks so much for
putting this together for him.

286
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:05,998
It means a lot.

287
00:18:18,277 --> 00:18:20,510
Yeah, he's all right.

288
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:22,180
So how are things?

289
00:18:22,205 --> 00:18:24,399
You look good. Everything's fine now?

290
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:26,430
Yeah, unless you know something I don't.

291
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:28,986
Uh, no, it's just that Mac told me

292
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,255
that he took you
to the doctor's the other day.

293
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:33,323
You know what? It's none of my business.

294
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,758
I never should've said anything.

295
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,730
No, no, no, it's fine.
It wasn't anything serious.

296
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,295
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

297
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:41,888
Yeah, everything's good.

298
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:43,936
We're good.

299
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:47,581
- Should I top you up?
- Uh, yes, please.

300
00:18:56,614 --> 00:18:58,814
There you go. I'm really sorry.

301
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,486
Hey! What the hell was that in there?

302
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:05,888
Well, I don't know, dawg, you tell me,

303
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,321
because you really botched it in there!

304
00:19:07,323 --> 00:19:08,489
- I did?
- Yeah!

305
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,557
Was I getting you all worked up?

306
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,925
No! It was... It was a terrible plan.

307
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,360
No, no, it wasn't a terrible plan!

308
00:19:12,362 --> 00:19:13,661
- Yeah! It was!
- It's your plan.

309
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:14,796
No, it wasn't my plan!

310
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:16,330
It's your plan, Trevor!
We've done it 10 times!

311
00:19:16,332 --> 00:19:17,966
All right? You're killing
me out here, man.

312
00:19:17,968 --> 00:19:19,234
You are so off your game today.

313
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:20,401
What are these?

314
00:19:20,403 --> 00:19:21,836
Benzos. Your favorite.

315
00:19:22,272 --> 00:19:23,704
This is my mother's medication.

316
00:19:23,706 --> 00:19:24,905
Trevor.

317
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:25,873
How did you get this?

318
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,340
Are you kidding? Man, don't even.

319
00:19:27,342 --> 00:19:28,475
Are you stealing from my family?

320
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:29,576
You told me to!

321
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:31,346
No, I didn't tell you to!

322
00:19:32,514 --> 00:19:33,929
Look, man...

323
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,749
just give me the pills.

324
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:36,850
No, I'm not giving you the pills.

325
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:37,651
Just be fair and give me
the pills, all right?

326
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:38,652
I gave you the last stash!

327
00:19:38,654 --> 00:19:39,753
We had a deal, bitch!

328
00:19:39,755 --> 00:19:41,654
Come on, chill out, guys.
Come on, Trevor.

329
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:42,688
Your head is still healing.

330
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,689
I'm not in any danger.

331
00:19:43,691 --> 00:19:44,577
No, you're right.

332
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:45,691
Just give me back the pills,
and you won't be.

333
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:47,093
Walk away.

334
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,100
Trevor!

335
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:55,168
Don't.

336
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:10,282
Trevor!

337
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:12,017
Yeah, screw you!

338
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:13,551
What?

339
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:15,030
Are you okay?

340
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:17,922
Wha...?

341
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:27,390
Okay, just sit back.

342
00:20:27,415 --> 00:20:28,748
Close your eyes.

343
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:35,136
What is this even supposed to do?

344
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:39,541
This... is connected
to a nerve in your head.

345
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:40,982
No, it's not.

346
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:43,006
You know reflexology's
not real medicine.

347
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,778
Okay. Next you're going to tell me

348
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,840
that the hip bone's
not connected to the leg bone.

349
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:48,785
It isn't.

350
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:49,852
All right, you know what? I'm j...

351
00:20:49,854 --> 00:20:51,120
I'm trying to help you relax,

352
00:20:51,122 --> 00:20:52,589
so just play along.

353
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:54,357
Okay. Close your eyes.

354
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:58,027
What happened here?

355
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,261
Uh, it's nothing.

356
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,363
It's just a reaction from an injection.

357
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:03,299
An injection of...?

358
00:21:03,301 --> 00:21:05,233
An antitoxin.

359
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:07,035
An antitoxin for...?

360
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,972
Marcy...

361
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:14,543
you're seeing things.

362
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:16,311
What do you mean?

363
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:18,879
The psychotropic effects
of the antitoxins.

364
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:21,793
You've been experiencing
them all day, kiddo.

365
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,551
An antitoxin for what?

366
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,052
Sorry, I shouldn't have said anything.

367
00:21:25,054 --> 00:21:26,387
I'm just...

368
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:28,723
I'm just experiencing some side effects.

369
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:31,326
Did you have anything
to do with that huge explosion

370
00:21:31,328 --> 00:21:32,537
at Van Huizen?

371
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:35,562
You know about that?

372
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:37,831
Well, it was the first mushroom cloud

373
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,065
we've had in the area

374
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,667
in what seems like forever.

375
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:42,469
It was all over the news.

376
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:43,737
They said it was

377
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:45,038
a combination of spilt chemicals

378
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,406
that accidentally combined with...

379
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,166
I mean, why am I telling you?
You were there.

380
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,710
They did say it was just
an accident, though.

381
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:53,512
They evacuated the area
in time, and no one was hurt.

382
00:21:53,514 --> 00:21:54,647
Marcy.

383
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,382
Marcy.

384
00:21:56,384 --> 00:21:58,351
Marce?

385
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,636
Marcy?

386
00:22:01,075 --> 00:22:03,242
Marcy, look at me.

387
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:26,410
Hey, MacLaren. Mac. Mac.

388
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:27,601
We're talking about the time

389
00:22:27,603 --> 00:22:29,773
that we had to evac
out of the south shelter.

390
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,016
Yeah. The emergency alarm goes off,

391
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,352
reveille bell's ringing bloody murder...

392
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,187
People screaming...

393
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,725
...And who comes walking in but 3468...

394
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,093
"Shit!

395
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:46,362
That warrant was in that other coat!"

396
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:53,903
There you are, man.
Where's your drink at?

397
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:54,970
No, no, I've had enough.

398
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,338
Don't quit on me now, Mac.

399
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,572
You'll need courage for your speech.

400
00:22:57,574 --> 00:22:58,907
Nobody wants to hear me talk.

401
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:00,542
Who wants to hear Mac's speech?

402
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:01,643
No! Shh!

403
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:03,412
I got to take a piss. I'll be back.

404
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:04,880
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

405
00:23:04,882 --> 00:23:06,981
Just have some Scotch.

406
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:14,955
Isn't this a great party, people?

407
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,093
You know what you need?

408
00:23:21,063 --> 00:23:22,614
Something to love.

409
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:25,098
It ain't good for a guy

410
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,434
to sit around that garage all day...

411
00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:28,736
you know, no sunshine, no companionship,

412
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:30,170
no girlfriend.

413
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:31,604
You got a boyfriend?

414
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:33,655
It's not a priority either way.

415
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,009
What about a pet?
You need something to talk to

416
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:39,178
other than your computer or yourself.

417
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,584
I've heard dog is a man's best friend.

418
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:44,652
A puppy? Yeah, right.

419
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:47,188
That's much better!

420
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,055
Puppy's a lot of commitment, Phil.

421
00:23:49,057 --> 00:23:50,973
It takes a whole lot of effort.

422
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:53,493
You got to pick up their shit.

423
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:54,883
They bark all the time.

424
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:56,124
You can't travel anywhere.

425
00:23:56,751 --> 00:23:58,207
A professional gambler like you,

426
00:23:58,209 --> 00:23:59,742
you got to be able to pick up

427
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,305
and fly to Vegas at any time, right?

428
00:24:01,865 --> 00:24:03,199
Right?

429
00:24:03,415 --> 00:24:05,381
Thanks, Ray. She's cute.

430
00:24:05,383 --> 00:24:07,282
You're welcome. Look at her.

431
00:24:07,284 --> 00:24:08,550
All right.

432
00:24:08,552 --> 00:24:10,419
There's one more place
I want to take ya.

433
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,156
You okay?

434
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,326
Yeah. I think so.

435
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:18,927
Come on, I thought you were gonna

436
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:20,061
kick that guy's ass.

437
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:21,963
Yeah, well, look, Rene,
I'm sorry if who I am

438
00:24:21,965 --> 00:24:23,731
doesn't work for you anymore, okay?

439
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:26,600
No, I like who you are.

440
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,235
To be honest...

441
00:24:28,237 --> 00:24:31,477
I was never really
into that other stuff anyways.

442
00:24:32,655 --> 00:24:33,930
I kind of just played along.

443
00:24:35,264 --> 00:24:36,677
Really?

444
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:38,512
True story.

445
00:24:38,514 --> 00:24:40,847
Okay, come on, let me
show you something.

446
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,682
Come with me.

447
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:45,151
I think you're gonna like this.

448
00:24:45,153 --> 00:24:47,587
I know there's a camera here somewhere.

449
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:58,029
Don't worry.

450
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:00,966
I won't let them hurt you. Okay?

451
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,476
No. It was a complete waste of time.

452
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,478
I'm gonna have to cut it all out again.

453
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,144
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.

454
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,013
Slow down. Take a breath.

455
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:21,018
I am so tired.

456
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,686
I know.

457
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:32,061
You really want to help me?

458
00:25:32,773 --> 00:25:33,997
Anything.

459
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,234
Not anything. You said no surgery.

460
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:42,438
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna
operate on you.

461
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,708
I mean, that's where
I draw the line. Sorry.

462
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,877
It's more of a procedure.

463
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,644
A simple one.

464
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:50,245
Well, see, now, how simple?

465
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:52,180
Because you said the last one was minor.

466
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:53,148
You can do this.

467
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,606
I know you can.

468
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:58,453
I wanted to ask you for a while,

469
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:00,874
but I was afraid that you'd say no.

470
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,566
Okay.

471
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,195
What do you want me to do?

472
00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:19,507
I know that you're staring at me.

473
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:21,409
How?

474
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,500
Because I'm highly trained.

475
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:26,379
How do you do that?

476
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,217
Clear your mind?

477
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,890
Most of the time, it's easy.

478
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,369
But today I'm finding
it a bit difficult.

479
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,858
Am I distracting you?

480
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:41,923
A lot's changed the last little while.

481
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:46,432
What? Talk to me.

482
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:50,570
I thought my life had purpose.

483
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:55,159
And then, one day,

484
00:26:55,161 --> 00:26:56,294
I woke up

485
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,977
almost surprised to be alive,

486
00:26:58,979 --> 00:27:00,335
and...

487
00:27:02,116 --> 00:27:04,450
I found out that my purpose was gone.

488
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,731
Everything that I've been doing...

489
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:14,625
has been focused on this one mission.

490
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:20,489
And now that there's no mission...

491
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:25,201
I'm just living a stranger's life.

492
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:29,239
It must be hard

493
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:31,273
not to be able to play football...

494
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:35,721
But...

495
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:38,338
just so you know...

496
00:27:39,217 --> 00:27:40,549
I was never with you

497
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:41,985
'cause you were

498
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,588
some superstar quarterback.

499
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:47,522
Really?

500
00:27:47,524 --> 00:27:48,717
No.

501
00:27:50,717 --> 00:27:52,360
It was the size of your dick.

502
00:27:57,534 --> 00:27:58,834
I'm kidding.

503
00:27:58,836 --> 00:28:00,102
- Well...
- I'm kidding.

504
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,705
But honestly...

505
00:28:04,707 --> 00:28:07,635
even if that's not
your mission anymore...

506
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,483
You're still gonna be someone great.

507
00:28:18,254 --> 00:28:19,854
There's the 15-year man!

508
00:28:19,856 --> 00:28:21,287
- Oh, come on.
- Hey!

509
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,722
Now, I was pretty
reluctant to do any of this,

510
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:23,757
because, let's be honest,

511
00:28:24,364 --> 00:28:25,825
he's a pretty lousy partner,

512
00:28:25,827 --> 00:28:27,360
but enough about his squash game.

513
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:32,498
Let's hear it for our colleague
and our friend,

514
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:34,968
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

515
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,202
Yeah!

516
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:38,804
Thanks a lot.

517
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,907
Uh, thanks, partner.

518
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:45,577
Um, it's a great afternoon.

519
00:28:45,579 --> 00:28:46,472
Isn't it?

520
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:57,555
A lot of familiar faces here.

521
00:29:02,628 --> 00:29:05,780
I can't tell you how strange
it is to know that...

522
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:09,949
I'll never see any of you again.

523
00:29:12,437 --> 00:29:13,770
Uh...

524
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:14,938
until Monday, uh, I mean, Monday...

525
00:29:17,576 --> 00:29:20,744
Um, so many stories from our past...

526
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:25,348
So many I can't talk about.

527
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,951
Teamwork...

528
00:29:27,953 --> 00:29:29,618
is everything, right?

529
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,253
Uh...

530
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:33,660
The people you work with...

531
00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:36,391
they become your family.

532
00:29:36,393 --> 00:29:39,795
A shared history, a shared mission...

533
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:42,795
that's... that's what you hold onto.

534
00:29:44,668 --> 00:29:47,736
I, and-and my actual family,

535
00:29:47,738 --> 00:29:49,604
my-my wife, Kathryn. Uh...

536
00:29:49,606 --> 00:29:52,043
She-She holds me up.

537
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:55,276
Probably literally tonight.

538
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:57,411
Jesus.

539
00:29:57,413 --> 00:29:59,447
- Ah, ah, no, no. Oi.
- Come on! Come on!

540
00:30:02,485 --> 00:30:03,917
All right.

541
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,252
15 more years!

542
00:30:06,588 --> 00:30:08,321
Woo!

543
00:30:12,128 --> 00:30:14,161
Thanks.

544
00:30:15,497 --> 00:30:17,231
Hey, maybe you should drive home.

545
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,233
Let's go.

546
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:30,292
Get in here!

547
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:32,327
Just...

548
00:30:33,237 --> 00:30:34,236
What's going on?

549
00:30:34,238 --> 00:30:35,371
Why don't you tell us?

550
00:30:35,373 --> 00:30:36,571
I, uh...

551
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,373
Trevor, why did you steal my medication?

552
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,710
I didn't steal your medication.

553
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,576
Well, it sure as hell didn't get
up and walk away on its own!

554
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:42,510
Okay, okay!

555
00:30:42,512 --> 00:30:44,013
Look, Nick stole it.

556
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:45,713
Nick? What the hell was
Nick doing in our bathroom?

557
00:30:45,715 --> 00:30:48,405
He was under the mistaken impression
that I wanted him to take it.

558
00:30:48,407 --> 00:30:49,925
Jesus! What are you doing?

559
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:51,686
You're lying, you're stealing,
and now you're doing drugs?

560
00:30:51,688 --> 00:30:53,253
No, I'm not doing drugs.

561
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:54,588
Well, you look you're high right now!

562
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,489
I'm not high. I...

563
00:30:55,491 --> 00:30:56,456
Take responsibility!

564
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,398
Be a man, for Christ's sake!

565
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,227
What? Like you, Gary? That kinda man?

566
00:31:07,594 --> 00:31:09,403
I told you the truth.

567
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,973
Here's your medication.

568
00:31:15,554 --> 00:31:16,821
Trevor!

569
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:23,082
L3...

570
00:31:23,641 --> 00:31:24,717
L4...

571
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:26,496
L5. Right there.

572
00:31:26,498 --> 00:31:27,952
Right there, between L4 and L5.

573
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:28,920
This is insane.

574
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:30,822
I can't do this without you.

575
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:32,056
You've already frozen the site.

576
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:34,158
It won't hurt as much as you think.

577
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:38,796
Okay, okay...

578
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:51,384
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

579
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,920
You're going good.
You're doing good. Keep going.

580
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,930
Oh, God, I... I felt a pop.

581
00:32:04,932 --> 00:32:06,264
I'm sorry. Something popped.

582
00:32:06,266 --> 00:32:09,467
No, it's good. Keep going. Okay.

583
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:17,943
Yeah?

584
00:32:17,945 --> 00:32:19,944
Okay.

585
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:21,546
Really?

586
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:22,713
How much of this goes in?

587
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:25,082
That's good.

588
00:32:25,084 --> 00:32:26,483
Okay.

589
00:32:31,551 --> 00:32:33,490
Oh, God, it's starting to leak.

590
00:32:33,492 --> 00:32:35,059
You're doing really good. Keep going.

591
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:36,059
Not really.

592
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:37,862
I'm kind of fainting over here.

593
00:32:44,316 --> 00:32:45,782
Done?

594
00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:53,008
These used to be your favorite.

595
00:33:00,785 --> 00:33:01,617
Okay.

596
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:02,851
Oh, shit.

597
00:33:02,853 --> 00:33:04,920
Okay... I need to start
analyzing the C.S.F.

598
00:33:04,922 --> 00:33:06,855
Oh, no. No. Not now. Not now.

599
00:33:06,857 --> 00:33:07,823
Rest.

600
00:33:08,783 --> 00:33:11,793
Just... Just rest.

601
00:33:11,795 --> 00:33:13,160
It's, uh...

602
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:15,262
pretend-doctor's orders.

603
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:28,642
Looks clean.

604
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,067
What do you want?

605
00:33:57,705 --> 00:34:00,039
Is this the residence of Ms. Shannon?

606
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:01,995
Who wants to know?

607
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:06,011
I'm Jacqueline Peele
with Child Protective Services.

608
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,181
Ms. Shannon,

609
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:11,415
it would be much better

610
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,897
if we had this conversation inside.

611
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:17,355
Ms. Shannon, I just have...

612
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,089
- Why are you here?
- ...a few questions for you.

613
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,093
I'm just here responding
to some concerns

614
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,962
that were raised about
Jeffrey's situation here.

615
00:34:24,964 --> 00:34:27,197
Where is this coming from?

616
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,266
Your husband.

617
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,735
Jeff is not my husband.

618
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,037
He's the father,

619
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,337
and we're obligated to follow up.

620
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,075
What're you writing?

621
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,711
Just my observations.

622
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,649
Ms. Shannon, are you
in some kind of trouble?

623
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,987
Who are you, really?

624
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,788
I beg your pardon?

625
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,005
Who sent you?

626
00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:56,559
Who are they?

627
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:57,959
What do they want from me?

628
00:34:57,961 --> 00:35:00,495
I've already told you, I'm with
Child Protective Services.

629
00:35:00,497 --> 00:35:02,097
Do you have a warrant to be here?

630
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:03,498
A court order of some kind?

631
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,102
No. This is, uh, an informal meeting,

632
00:35:07,104 --> 00:35:08,003
but if you want me to leave...

633
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,503
Yes. I do.

634
00:35:09,505 --> 00:35:10,270
Now.

635
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,609
All right.

636
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:17,178
I will have to make a note

637
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,612
that you refused this initial...

638
00:35:18,614 --> 00:35:20,681
- Get out.
- ...Meeting, Ms. Shannon.

639
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:57,006
Walt seems good.

640
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:58,975
Yeah, he's a machine.

641
00:35:58,977 --> 00:36:00,309
He said

642
00:36:00,311 --> 00:36:03,544
that you've been paying
more attention to me lately.

643
00:36:03,546 --> 00:36:05,680
Well, that's not so bad, is it?

644
00:36:05,682 --> 00:36:07,849
It's not true.

645
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:09,517
What's not true?

646
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:14,655
He said you left work early
to take me to an appointment?

647
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:16,024
I did?

648
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:17,825
No, Grant, you didn't.

649
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,494
So what were you really doing?

650
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:22,696
W-When?

651
00:36:22,698 --> 00:36:24,554
What were you really doing when you were

652
00:36:24,556 --> 00:36:26,833
supposed to be taking me to the doctor?

653
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:28,335
I'm not an idiot, Grant.

654
00:36:28,337 --> 00:36:30,137
I've noticed the changes.

655
00:36:31,461 --> 00:36:32,460
The diet,

656
00:36:32,462 --> 00:36:34,495
locking me out of your cell phone.

657
00:36:34,497 --> 00:36:36,396
Something's going on.

658
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:40,500
Tell me. Tell me.

659
00:36:43,272 --> 00:36:45,389
I'm not who you think...

660
00:36:46,047 --> 00:36:47,680
What?

661
00:36:48,043 --> 00:36:50,677
You're not what? Tell me!

662
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,957
I'm in love with you.

663
00:37:11,598 --> 00:37:13,698
I always have been.

664
00:38:27,403 --> 00:38:29,003
No. Stay.

665
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,140
I'm Colin, and I'm an addict.

666
00:39:08,142 --> 00:39:09,307
Hi, Colin.

667
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,995
We'd like to welcome a newcomer.

668
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:14,826
Would you please introduce yourself?

669
00:39:21,399 --> 00:39:22,787
The kid's shy.

670
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:24,255
That's okay.

671
00:39:24,257 --> 00:39:26,156
Then why don't you start?

672
00:39:28,673 --> 00:39:30,460
I admitted

673
00:39:30,775 --> 00:39:32,759
I was powerless over my addiction.

674
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:34,798
I give over my will and my life

675
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,470
to the Director.

676
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:41,571
And I pray for the knowledge
of the Director's will for me...

677
00:39:41,573 --> 00:39:43,772
and the power to carry it out.

678
00:39:47,271 --> 00:39:49,412
The Director doesn't know.

679
00:39:49,414 --> 00:39:52,348
Thank you, Traveler 7294.

680
00:40:01,491 --> 00:40:04,259
I'm Traveler 3326.

681
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:06,694
I've been in the 21st century
for five weeks now,

682
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,396
and I'm so fricking tired,

683
00:40:08,398 --> 00:40:10,631
I just wanna lie down and get high.

684
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,203
The other day, we saved the world.

685
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:16,871
Now what do I do?

686
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:22,642
I was selected and trained
to remember everything.

687
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:24,644
Everything...

688
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:25,846
dates, coordinates,

689
00:40:25,848 --> 00:40:28,182
candidates, people.

690
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:31,218
Every death. Every single one.

691
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,518
But I can't even remember my own face...

692
00:40:37,592 --> 00:40:41,627
the face I was born with
hundreds of years from now.

693
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:47,910
But I guess that's okay.

694
00:40:49,604 --> 00:40:51,803
Because that's who I am now...

695
00:40:51,805 --> 00:40:53,905
and I'd better get used to it, right?

696
00:40:58,045 --> 00:40:59,544
I'm Philip,

697
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:01,384
and I'm from the future.

698
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:06,985
Go ahead and say it loud, kid.

699
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:08,185
That's all you got to do.

700
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:13,190
Makes a difference.

701
00:41:20,766 --> 00:41:23,734
My name is Philip,
and I'm a heroin addict.

702
00:41:23,736 --> 00:41:26,269
Hi, Philip.

703
00:42:28,204 --> 00:42:31,126
_

704
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,249
You do some redecorating?

705
00:42:52,952 --> 00:42:55,920
What happened to
Protocol 5 indefinitely?

706
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:58,856
Can't Trevor and Philip be friends?

707
00:43:01,063 --> 00:43:03,261
You're at least a hundred years
older than me.

708
00:43:03,263 --> 00:43:04,862
Well, I'm young at heart.

709
00:43:04,864 --> 00:43:06,998
Not so much.

710
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,698
Look, I need a couch to crash on.

711
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:10,296
That I believe.

712
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:14,204
Mi casa es su casa.

713
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:15,649
Thank you.

714
00:43:17,057 --> 00:43:18,712
It's been a weird day.

715
00:43:19,512 --> 00:43:21,445
You have any side effects
from the antitoxin?

716
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,447
Hallucinations? Voices?

717
00:43:23,449 --> 00:43:24,438
Yeah.

718
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,050
Happens to me all the time, actually.

719
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:29,546
Really?

720
00:43:30,155 --> 00:43:31,187
Yeah.

721
00:43:32,897 --> 00:43:34,890
That's some shit you deal with.

722
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:38,834
I think it's starting to wear off.

723
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:42,120
Yeah. Me too.

724
00:43:47,237 --> 00:43:48,369
What is it?

725
00:43:49,406 --> 00:43:51,473
We just received a new mission.

726
00:43:54,657 --> 00:43:57,045
We're back on.

727
00:44:00,864 --> 00:44:09,399
