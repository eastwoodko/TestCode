00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,448
Previously on Travelers.

2
00:00:01,473 --> 00:00:02,172
- I know.
- What?

3
00:00:02,207 --> 00:00:03,373
That you're pregnant.

4
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:04,707
Your son was involved in a shooting.

5
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:06,009
He may not regain the use of his legs.

6
00:00:06,044 --> 00:00:07,010
Ow!

7
00:00:07,045 --> 00:00:07,810
Eye drops.

8
00:00:07,846 --> 00:00:08,945
Synthetic compound

9
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:10,347
to help with the heroin addition.

10
00:00:10,382 --> 00:00:11,647
Jenny, by the way.

11
00:00:11,683 --> 00:00:14,083
Jeffrey Jr. is in the hands
of Washington Family Services.

12
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:15,685
No! He needs to be with his mother!

13
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,754
Destroy the device, Walt.

14
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,522
I'm Traveler 4112.

15
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:20,890
Artificial Intelligence
isn't supposed to be capable

16
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:22,759
of taking a life
that isn't about to end.

17
00:00:22,794 --> 00:00:23,826
The Director shouldn't have risked it!

18
00:00:23,862 --> 00:00:25,194
Don't you understand?

19
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:26,161
Why do you think
that they're still after you?

20
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:27,897
Because they've already found me twice.

21
00:00:27,932 --> 00:00:29,265
And they'll be coming for me.

22
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:44,979
Hey.

23
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:46,080
Hey.

24
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:48,082
Thanks for picking me up.
I know you're working.

25
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:49,851
No problem.

26
00:00:49,887 --> 00:00:51,920
Have you told Walt?

27
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,189
I haven't told anybody.

28
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:06,901
No.

29
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:08,937
Don't. I can't. I can't.

30
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:11,806
I can't. No. I can't.

31
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,244
Don't.

32
00:01:20,683 --> 00:01:22,282
Please!

33
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:23,684
You.

34
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,119
You bastard, we're after you.

35
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:27,220
No.

36
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:28,255
Please.

37
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:33,989
_

38
00:01:38,862 --> 00:01:39,928
What?

39
00:01:39,963 --> 00:01:41,532
Hit a snag in the basement.

40
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,264
Pipe leaking water.

41
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,339
Show me.

42
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,354
Get a sledge.

43
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:46,735

45
00:02:52,118 --> 00:02:53,450
Alive and well.

46
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:55,085
Officer Boyd.

47
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:56,086
I'm very glad to see

48
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:57,487
your vest worked as advertised.

49
00:02:57,523 --> 00:02:59,322
Yeah, you didn't have to shoot twice.

50
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:02,358
Sorry. Professional instinct.

51
00:03:02,394 --> 00:03:04,761
He's with us now.

52
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:06,463
4112.

53
00:03:06,498 --> 00:03:07,564
What the hell happened in there?

54
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,098
Exactly what happened to my team.

55
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:10,901
Except these four weren't rescued.

56
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:13,193
I can't imagine
who'd do something like this.

57
00:03:13,676 --> 00:03:14,775
When I last saw you,

58
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:16,611
you said something about
some faction in the future

59
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:17,912
that exists now.

60
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,179
The faction's been around for years.

61
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:20,982
It started as a movement in...

62
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:22,718
Shelter 41, I know.

63
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:23,818
Shelter 41 collapsed.

64
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:25,419
Not in the future he came from.

65
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:27,254
Least it was there when I left.

66
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,957
Guys, I think we need to keep
Protocol 2 in mind here.

67
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:32,892
Right. Well, this couldn't be
the work of the faction anyway.

68
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:33,860
Why not?

69
00:03:33,895 --> 00:03:35,106
You told me, when my team went missing,

70
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,540
that you'd seen this kind of thing

71
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:39,266
happening long before
I arrived in the 21st.

72
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:41,034
The faction didn't exist when I left.

73
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:43,137
I always assumed it was the Director.

74
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:44,171
There's no way the Director's

75
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:45,972
capable of what we just saw in there.

76
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:48,341
Isn't letting it happen just as bad?

77
00:03:49,254 --> 00:03:50,977
When can my team have the scene?

78
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,579
Forensics will be
another few hours at least.

79
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:55,782
But, after that, it's all yours.

80
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,857
Trev?

81
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:07,460
I don't want you to feel down

82
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:09,662
on account of this thing taking months.

83
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:13,899
You shouldn't feel down either, Gary.

84
00:04:13,934 --> 00:04:16,802
I know, I know, but I can't help it.

85
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:18,137
I mean...

86
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:20,605
kid, you used to fly!

87
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,507
If you had pressure in the pocket,

88
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:25,255
you would just put on those afterburners

89
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,612
and blow right through the defense.

90
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:31,416
That was a thing to watch.

91
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,654
Must be hard for you.

92
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,522
It is.

93
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:39,624
It's really hard.

94
00:04:42,974 --> 00:04:44,663
You'll get through it.

95
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:46,398
I know you will.

96
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:47,979
Thanks, son.

97
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:51,203
Hey...

98
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:52,770
You too.

99
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:56,240
Know what?

100
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,274
This... this is good right here.

101
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,409
I can walk from here.

102
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,620
Thank you.

103
00:05:13,392 --> 00:05:14,891
You okay?

104
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,217
Yeah, I got it.

105
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,996
Thanks for the lift, Dad.

106
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:02,271
Dr. Thomson,

107
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:03,472
you're needed ...in Radiology 2.

108
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:05,574
Dr. Thomson in Radiology 2.

109
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:11,147
You're up next.

110
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:12,782
Excellent photography.

111
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:15,684
Dr. Barker. How are you doing today?

112
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:17,252
Great. You?

113
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:18,654
Oh, fine, thanks.

114
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,230
Great. That's really, uh...

115
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:24,159
I should probably...

116
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:25,527
Oh. Yeah, uh...

117
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:27,896
Don't... Don't let me get in your way.

118
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:29,864
I was just gonna ask, uh...

119
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:33,802
You're busy,

120
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:35,211
Uh, I'll come by later.

121
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:36,637
Okay. Are you sure?

122
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:38,239
Yeah. Yeah. I've... I've got a...

123
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:40,108
But I will definitely...

124
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:41,142
Okay.

125
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:42,143
You too.

126
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,978
I mean, uh...

127
00:06:44,014 --> 00:06:45,931
Right this way.

128
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,039
You don't think I would've
told you if we had a mission?

129
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:14,141
Well, maybe another team got one.

130
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:15,843
It's been a long time.

131
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,478
2,163 hours.

132
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:20,147
Not that I'm counting.

133
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,850
You really are an optimist.

134
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:26,853
Yeah. Yeah, I really am.

135
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,429
You can quit if you want.

136
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:50,054
Five.

137
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:53,014
Time.

138
00:07:54,093 --> 00:07:55,792
All right!

139
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:58,428
We did it!

140
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:03,466
I just thought you might want
a little bit of human contact.

141
00:08:03,502 --> 00:08:05,168
Oh...

142
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:07,571
Two minutes recovery
and then we go again.

143
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,673
No problem.

144
00:08:12,477 --> 00:08:13,676
...A construction site

145
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,346
in the area of Edmondville.

146
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:17,813
Four missing persons reports

147
00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:19,782
came to a heartbreaking conclusion today

148
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:22,052
as a demolition team found their bodies

149
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,287
in an abandoned building.

150
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:26,022
Out of respect for the families,

151
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:28,591
police have yet to release any names,

152
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:31,694
however, foul play has been assumed.

153
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:33,596
Adena Moore is at the site now.

154
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:35,330
Adena, are you able to give us

155
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:38,067
any details on what happened there?

156
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:40,469
Well, what we're looking at now...

157
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,169
That's the smell of death.

158
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:23,811
Police forensics came up with nothing.

159
00:09:23,846 --> 00:09:25,580
Your turn.

160
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:42,596
Trevor and I kind of
just threw this together...

161
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:45,110
But it should work.

162
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:50,337
Sorry! Set too high.

163
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:52,772
We're good.

164
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:26,472
Hey! I got a com over here.

165
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:43,221
Get out of the building now!

166
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,556
Go.

167
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:45,891
Go!

168
00:10:45,926 --> 00:10:47,959
Go. Go, go! Go!

169
00:11:51,823 --> 00:11:53,144
Morning.

170
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:54,268
Mm.

171
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:56,360
Smells delicious.

172
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,866
You never cooked this much

173
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:05,272
when we were together before.

174
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,227
You just never liked my cooking.

175
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:10,840
Oh, you're definitely
a better cook, but...

176
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:14,726
It's like you're a different person now.

177
00:12:14,761 --> 00:12:16,962
Nope. Same guy.

178
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,630
On the outside, maybe.

179
00:12:18,665 --> 00:12:20,031
Yeah, and on the inside,

180
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:21,765
nougat and caramel.

181
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:23,801
Otherwise,

182
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:26,871
I am the same guy you broke up with.

183
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,241
I didn't know what I had, David.

184
00:12:31,311 --> 00:12:32,410
Same guy.

185
00:12:32,445 --> 00:12:34,879
Hey! I'm trying to give you
a compliment here, okay?

186
00:12:34,914 --> 00:12:38,148
You're... you're more confident.

187
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:39,884
I used to be able to read you,

188
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,918
but it feels like

189
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:42,684
there's so much more going on
in there now.

190
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,555
It's mysterious.

191
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:48,826
You don't know mysterious.

192
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:53,096
You know, there's
an ingredient in these eggs

193
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:54,564
that's gonna blow your mind.

194
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,435
You okay?

195
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,504
Yeah, I'll be fine. It'll... It'll pass.

196
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:02,005
Blair, this keeps happening.

197
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,573
Let's get you in to see a doctor.

198
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,175
I'm fine. Really.

199
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,276
Ah!

200
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:07,677
Okay, that's enough.

201
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:08,980
Let's go.

202
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:21,242
Hey, Carly?

203
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,259
It's hard for me to focus

204
00:13:23,294 --> 00:13:25,294
with you pacing around
with a gun in your hand.

205
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,430
Sorry.

206
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:28,708
It's okay.

207
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:31,533
So judging by the T.E.L.L.

208
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:32,803
of these four host candidates,

209
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,438
I think I've figured out
who our group was.

210
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:37,039
A team of five just like us.

211
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,108
Which leaves one member unaccounted for.

212
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:41,932
Traveler 2192.

213
00:13:41,968 --> 00:13:43,279
Let's find them.

214
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:44,613
If they're still alive.

215
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,224
I think I can narrow it down

216
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,658
by checking which candidates didn't die

217
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,127
the day 2192 arrived.

218
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,896
This com isn't telling me much,

219
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,632
other than it's been all over the place.

220
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:56,767
Get that com working.

221
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,170
Look, I'm sorry,

222
00:14:00,205 --> 00:14:02,039
but we've already contacted
all of the victims' families.

223
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,040
But Jacob went missing

224
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,842
at the same time as those other people.

225
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,111
I mean, isn't it possible
that there were more victims?

226
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:09,179
No, there were only
four found at that location,

227
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:10,247
and none of them
were named Jacob, ma'am.

228
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,882
- I am sorry.
- Beth, Beth.

229
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,851
Let me. Let me to talk to her.

230
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,218
If you say so.

231
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,586
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

232
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:19,556
Come on in here. We'll talk privately.

233
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,625
Thank you.

234
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,594
Have a seat, Mrs...?

235
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,515
Ward. Sylvie.

236
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,399
You say your husband's been
missing for sometime?

237
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:30,933
Three and a half months.

238
00:14:31,479 --> 00:14:33,602
That... That is a long time.

239
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:36,472
The police haven't been
able to find anything.

240
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:38,440
I don't even think
they're looking anymore.

241
00:14:38,476 --> 00:14:39,942
What can you tell me about him?

242
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:42,078
Jacob's wonderful.

243
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:45,247
I mean, we had our troubles
through the years,

244
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:48,151
but lately,
the last year and a half or so,

245
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:49,962
our marriage has never been better.

246
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:51,587
- What changed?
- Before,

247
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:54,670
he was loud, he smoked like a fiend.

248
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:57,759
He wasn't health-conscious at all.

249
00:14:57,795 --> 00:15:00,629
But I always knew
that he would come around,

250
00:15:00,665 --> 00:15:01,630
and he did.

251
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,232
Almost overnight,

252
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:05,634
his priorities completely realigned.

253
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:08,636
He became more attentive,
compassionate...

254
00:15:08,672 --> 00:15:09,637
Did you ever see him

255
00:15:09,673 --> 00:15:12,240
in the company of
any of the other victims?

256
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:16,611
He didn't run away with another woman,

257
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:17,746
if that's what you're thinking.

258
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:19,447
That's not what I'm thinking.

259
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:22,684
I'm just wondering
if there's a connection.

260
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,285
Say, in the workplace?

261
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:26,987
Jacob didn't believe in bringing
his work home with him.

262
00:15:27,023 --> 00:15:28,823
He said that was our time.

263
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:32,293
And you've had no communication
with your husband's cell phone?

264
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,262
Any activity in his bank accounts?

265
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:35,430
No. Nothing.

266
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,924
But I believe that he is
still alive, Agent MacLaren.

267
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,534
I have to.

268
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:54,648
Didn't you just take some of that?

269
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:56,850
She said to take it as needed,

270
00:15:56,885 --> 00:15:58,985
and I need to focus.

271
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:03,022
Does Marcy know what's in this?

272
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:04,625
It's Marcy-approved.

273
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,365
Let's get back to work.

274
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:11,865
You guys there?

275
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,966
Yeah, boss, what's up?

276
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:15,101
I got a name on our fifth traveler.

277
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:16,173
Jacob Ward.

278
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:17,336
We're on it.

279
00:16:17,372 --> 00:16:19,958
Philip, I want you to put
a tap on his wife's cell phone.

280
00:16:19,994 --> 00:16:20,940
Sylvie Ward.

281
00:16:20,976 --> 00:16:23,743
She just paid me a visit.
I'll text you the address.

282
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:25,111
Will do, boss.

283
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:29,114
Shit!

284
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,150
I gotta go.

285
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,760
I'm sure Carly
will be here any minute now.

286
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:42,161
Her new job's...

287
00:16:42,196 --> 00:16:43,596
been a little crazy.

288
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:46,231
In the meantime, how are you doing?

289
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:48,741
Fine.

290
00:16:48,969 --> 00:16:50,535
Lot of change in your life.

291
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,150
How's that going?

292
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,553
Ah, that's all good.

293
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:56,254
Just living through the changes.

294
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,614
When Carly's here,

295
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:58,943
I sometimes get the impression

296
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:01,253
that you're going out
of your way to agree with her.

297
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:03,494
Might be useful to use this time,

298
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,091
while we have it, to talk about you.

299
00:17:06,152 --> 00:17:07,134
Ahem.

300
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:10,835
Yeah, I can do that.

301
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:11,931
Okay.

302
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,340
Do that.

303
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:19,309
How much do you know about guilt?

304
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:21,414
I am so sorry I'm late.

305
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:23,113
Hey... there she is!

306
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:24,114
Traffic was just...

307
00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:25,683
Ahh!

308
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:27,418
Well, you're here now.

309
00:17:27,453 --> 00:17:28,919
Ahem. So...

310
00:17:28,954 --> 00:17:30,488
big week for you two.

311
00:17:30,523 --> 00:17:33,491
Your final custody assessment from CPS.

312
00:17:33,526 --> 00:17:35,192
How are the two of you feeling?

313
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:37,560
Good.

314
00:17:37,596 --> 00:17:38,628
Yeah, it's really good.

315
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:41,398
- Really good.
- That's... good.

316
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,141
Marce!

317
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:52,375
Hi!

318
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,176
I've been looking everywhere for you.

319
00:17:54,212 --> 00:17:56,613
Uh, is everything all right?

320
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:58,186
Yeah.

321
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:00,049
Everything's fine.

322
00:18:00,084 --> 00:18:01,984
No. Um...

323
00:18:03,021 --> 00:18:05,555
I got back together with... with Blair.

324
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,556
And, um...

325
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,024
Good for you.

326
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,027
I wasn't looking for you
to tell you that,

327
00:18:11,062 --> 00:18:13,462
but I think there might be
something wrong with her.

328
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:15,831
Uh, well, did you take her to admitting?

329
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:17,099
Yeah, see, that was the original plan,

330
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:19,368
but then I learned
she doesn't have insurance.

331
00:18:19,404 --> 00:18:22,204
Um... But she's been having
these harsh stomach pains

332
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,505
for over a week now,

333
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,040
and I'm worried that if
she doesn't get it looked at...

334
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:28,376
David, I...
I'm just an x-ray technician.

335
00:18:28,412 --> 00:18:30,846
I think we both know
that that's not true.

336
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:35,183
Besides, I think an x-ray's
exactly what she does need.

337
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:38,019
Right. Uh...

338
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:40,355
Bring her to imaging in block "C".

339
00:18:42,092 --> 00:18:43,425
Thank you.

340
00:18:47,264 --> 00:18:49,530
You two are really gonna hit it off.

341
00:18:58,074 --> 00:19:01,208
- Hey, Boss.
- Hey. What have you got?

342
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:02,743
You were right. Our man, Jacob,

343
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,044
is definitely our missing traveler.

344
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,581
He went off the grid sometime mid-May.

345
00:19:06,616 --> 00:19:08,248
If he's still out there,
he's good at hiding.

346
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:10,084
Any action on the wife's cell?

347
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,967
There's already a tap on her line.

348
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:14,554
Someone else is watching her besides us.

349
00:19:16,425 --> 00:19:18,725
Trevor, you got that com working yet?

350
00:19:19,928 --> 00:19:21,362
Ready when you are.

351
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,104
Hello?

352
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,134
This is Traveler 3468.

353
00:19:27,169 --> 00:19:29,470
2192, are you there?

354
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:31,838
How did you get on this channel?

355
00:19:33,308 --> 00:19:34,908
I'm sure you've heard by now...

356
00:19:34,943 --> 00:19:36,543
the rest of your team is dead.

357
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,712
We found this com at the crime scene.

358
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:40,046
We want to help.

359
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:42,382
Is your mission
from the Director to assist me?

360
00:19:42,417 --> 00:19:44,217
No. But my team was captured,

361
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:45,118
the same as yours.

362
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:46,653
I think it's important that...

363
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:48,388
Then stand down!

364
00:19:48,423 --> 00:19:50,689
Do you have a tap
on your wife's cell phone?

365
00:19:50,725 --> 00:19:52,458
What?

366
00:19:52,494 --> 00:19:54,293
Someone besides us
is tracking your wife.

367
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,461
Is it you?

368
00:19:57,665 --> 00:19:59,465
Jacob?

369
00:19:59,501 --> 00:20:01,934
He's still there. The
signal's still strong.

370
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:03,669
He's cutting out his com.

371
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,272
Do not remove your com! Jacob!

372
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,607
Your wife is in trouble!

373
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:10,776
Jacob!

374
00:20:12,013 --> 00:20:13,846
We lost him.

375
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:14,980
Okay.

376
00:20:15,016 --> 00:20:17,082
Keep monitoring her phone.

377
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:18,868
I think I know where he's going.

378
00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:28,168
Hi.

379
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:31,244
You found something, didn't you?

380
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,132
Uh...

381
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,583
The scans did show
a foreign mass in her stomach.

382
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:37,984
Oh, God, here we go.

383
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,586
I'm afraid to even guess at what...

384
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:41,555
You don't have to.

385
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,024
It's cotton balls.

386
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,927
Cotton balls?

387
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:49,329
How could she possibly have ingested...

388
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:50,931
It's a weight-loss thing...

389
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:52,966
It's supposed to make you feel fuller.

390
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,967
I don't know.

391
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,668
David, I don't think
that you realize how...

392
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:56,669
I know.

393
00:20:56,704 --> 00:20:57,670
And not to mention

394
00:20:57,705 --> 00:20:59,004
unbelievably dangerous.

395
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,139
I mean, she's lucky
she didn't eat enough

396
00:21:00,174 --> 00:21:01,140
to cause an obstruction.

397
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,243
Yeah, that's what happened last time.

398
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,179
All right. Uh...

399
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:10,182
We'll get her stomach pumped
and she'll be on her way,

400
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:12,376
but you cannot let her...

401
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:14,153
I know, I know.

402
00:21:14,188 --> 00:21:15,387
I know.

403
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:17,426
I'll talk to her.

404
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:20,259
Um...

405
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:26,060
Thank you.

406
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:28,062
You're welcome.

407
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,002
Agent MacLaren. Is there news?

408
00:22:04,037 --> 00:22:07,036
Actually, I was hoping
Jacob had contacted you.

409
00:22:07,071 --> 00:22:09,205
Contacted? I haven't heard a thing.

410
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,874
- Mind if I come in?
- Is everything all right?

411
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:11,875
I hope so.

412
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:12,876
I just have a few more questions.

413
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:14,377
I just... I'm late for an appointment.

414
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:17,313
Maybe I could drop by your office later?

415
00:22:18,449 --> 00:22:20,683
How did you break this?

416
00:22:20,719 --> 00:22:21,851
I told you to leave me alone!

417
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:22,852
Jacob!

418
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:24,387
- I'm here to help you!
- Jacob!

419
00:22:24,422 --> 00:22:26,422
He's running! Back stairs!

420
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:36,865
Jacob!

421
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:40,702
Jacob!

422
00:22:45,442 --> 00:22:47,342
You all right?

423
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:54,683
Stop it! I'm Traveler 3465.

424
00:22:54,718 --> 00:22:56,284
We're here to help you.

425
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,786
And you're making that
awfully goddamn difficult.

426
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:01,722
You people have no idea what
you're getting yourselves into!

427
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,224
Traveler teams from all over the world

428
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,559
are being abducted and tortured.

429
00:23:04,594 --> 00:23:06,094
We know.

430
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:07,262
The Director assigned us

431
00:23:07,297 --> 00:23:08,696
to investigate their disappearances,

432
00:23:08,731 --> 00:23:10,865
but they found us before we could...

433
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:17,738
It's bad.

434
00:23:17,774 --> 00:23:19,941
Marcy, drop what you're doing.
Get back to Ops.

435
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:21,742
You got a patient.

436
00:23:26,616 --> 00:23:29,116
Keep your eyes open.
We're getting you to our medic.

437
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:30,784
Call Sylvie.

438
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:32,119
You need to tell us what you know.

439
00:23:32,154 --> 00:23:34,321
What did your team find out?
Who's behind this?

440
00:23:34,356 --> 00:23:36,123
Whoever it is...

441
00:23:36,158 --> 00:23:37,724
they cover their tracks.

442
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,660
We do know that the buildings...

443
00:23:40,696 --> 00:23:43,330
every one Travelers were taken to,

444
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:45,966
all... all a-around the world...

445
00:23:47,936 --> 00:23:49,502
What about the buildings?

446
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:51,304
They're owned by numbered companies.

447
00:23:51,339 --> 00:23:53,073
Sh-Sh... Shells...

448
00:23:53,108 --> 00:23:55,842
but under one conglomerate.

449
00:23:55,877 --> 00:23:57,010
Give us a name, Jacob!

450
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:01,547
Jacob! Jacob!

451
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:33,145
His lung's collapsed.
We need to re-inflate it.

452
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,713
Carly?

453
00:24:53,566 --> 00:24:55,066
He needs shock.

454
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,024
- Charge?
- Mm-hmm.

455
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,574
Clear.

456
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:06,844
Charge again.

457
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,212
Clear.

458
00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:17,741
He's gone.

459
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,043
Hello?

460
00:25:32,078 --> 00:25:33,244
Hey, it's me.

461
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,212
What a total surprise.

462
00:25:35,248 --> 00:25:36,447
Funny.

463
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:37,681
Hey, before I drop by tonight,

464
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:38,849
you want me to stop at the grocery store

465
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:41,352
and pick up anything special,
craving-wise?

466
00:25:41,387 --> 00:25:42,353
Oh...

467
00:25:42,388 --> 00:25:45,088
Um... Yes!

468
00:25:45,124 --> 00:25:47,324
Some kind of smoked meat.

469
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,825
Meat.

470
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:49,926
I need the iron!

471
00:25:49,962 --> 00:25:51,529
What's the smoke for?

472
00:25:51,564 --> 00:25:53,764
Nobody craves broccoli, Grant.

473
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,098
You're the one who offered.

474
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:56,533
Kat, someone's on the other line.

475
00:25:56,568 --> 00:25:57,534
I'll call you back.

476
00:25:57,569 --> 00:25:59,291
Mm-hmm. Okay.

477
00:25:59,584 --> 00:26:00,550
MacLaren.

478
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:02,039
Okay, so, the sole owner

479
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:03,406
of the company that owns that building

480
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:04,708
is Vincent Ingram.

481
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:07,010
He's got an estate
about an hour from downtown.

482
00:26:07,046 --> 00:26:09,512
I let one of his people know
that you were on your way.

483
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:12,915
Okay, great. Thanks, Beth.
Text me the address.

484
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,384
Just did.

485
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:18,421
Hi.

486
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:20,956
Have you seen my eye drops?

487
00:26:20,992 --> 00:26:22,692
Nope.

488
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,093
I just got here.

489
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,161
You were the last person

490
00:26:25,197 --> 00:26:27,329
who had them yesterday,
when we were working.

491
00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:30,099
I didn't take your drops, Philip. Relax.

492
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:31,633
What's that supposed to mean?

493
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:32,935
Uh...

494
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,071
look around.

495
00:26:36,307 --> 00:26:37,873
Just give them back.

496
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:39,809
What's going on, man?

497
00:26:39,844 --> 00:26:41,443
I know you're trying to monitor me.

498
00:26:41,478 --> 00:26:43,245
I can take care of myself,

499
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,913
so just back off

500
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:46,981
and give me back my drops.

501
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:55,424
Here.

502
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,726
Ahem.

503
00:26:57,761 --> 00:26:58,727
Jeez.

504
00:26:58,762 --> 00:27:00,595
Ahem.

505
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,163
It's a good thing

506
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:04,498
these are helping
with your addiction, huh?

507
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,194
Jeez.

508
00:27:12,308 --> 00:27:14,508
Hey. This is Marcy. Leave a message.

509
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,712
Hey, Marce... y.

510
00:27:17,747 --> 00:27:19,614
Uh, I just wanted to say thanks again

511
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:21,115
for your help with Blair.

512
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,485
Uh, I really appreciate it,
and she's doing better, so...

513
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,519
Um...

514
00:27:26,044 --> 00:27:28,489
Anyway, uh, I was hoping
that you could, uh,

515
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,258
you could join me...

516
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:31,992
me and Blair, for dinner tonight,

517
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:33,660
as a way to say thank you.

518
00:27:33,772 --> 00:27:35,996
Uh, so if you're free,
that would be great,

519
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,631
to see you.

520
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:38,799
I know I just saw you,

521
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,467
but it would be...

522
00:27:40,502 --> 00:27:42,970
it'd great to see you again.

523
00:27:44,073 --> 00:27:46,640
I do, like, a fish dish now.

524
00:27:46,675 --> 00:27:48,675
Uh, "Branzini."

525
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,570
I know you like white fish
and all those Omega-3s.

526
00:27:52,414 --> 00:27:54,406
No cotton balls, I promise.

527
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:57,284
Anyway, uh...

528
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,820
All this to say I hope you can join me.

529
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:02,389
Us...

530
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:05,024
I mean, because Blair
will be there, too.

531
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,725
And you...

532
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:08,294
I hope.

533
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,131
Oh, for God's sakes.

534
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:18,096
But we've grown up a lot.

535
00:28:18,439 --> 00:28:20,206
And Carly's an amazing woman,

536
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:23,342
and I'm thankful every day
that she's a part of my life.

537
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,212
How's your landscaping job going?

538
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,107
Still great.

539
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,816
I see that neither of you

540
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:32,551
have missed a session
with your counselor.

541
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,552
How have they been going?

542
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:35,321
- Very helpful.
- Good, yeah. Very.

543
00:28:35,356 --> 00:28:36,865
Tell me how.

544
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:43,872
Well, I was...

545
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:46,792
angry.

546
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,434
And hurt.

547
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,503
But, by talking things through,

548
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:55,373
we found out that we were both angry.

549
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:58,075
We just didn't have
as much to be mad about

550
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,596
as we thought we did.

551
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:03,179
The counseling has
helped me forgive Jeff.

552
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:06,149
And to not let the past stop me

553
00:29:06,184 --> 00:29:07,854
from seeing who he is now.

554
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:16,192
I have to admit,

555
00:29:16,228 --> 00:29:18,728
you're doing very well
at keeping up the act.

556
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:23,233
Oh, please. I've been
doing this a long time.

557
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:24,433
You can't fool me.

558
00:29:24,469 --> 00:29:25,601
Jacqueline...

559
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:27,353
But it's not necessarily a bad thing.

560
00:29:27,388 --> 00:29:29,239
It means you want to try.

561
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:30,806
Most marriages include

562
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:33,542
at least a little bit
of faking it, trust me.

563
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:35,811
I can see how much this means
to the both of you,

564
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,646
and how committed you are.

565
00:29:37,682 --> 00:29:40,841
You may not ever be great spouses,

566
00:29:40,877 --> 00:29:41,888
but...

567
00:29:42,754 --> 00:29:45,308
I think you could be good parents.

568
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:56,198
This way.

569
00:30:01,838 --> 00:30:03,571
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

570
00:30:03,607 --> 00:30:05,607
My office called.

571
00:30:10,367 --> 00:30:13,547
_

572
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,229
_

573
00:30:34,517 --> 00:30:36,517
_

574
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,030
I apologize for the conditions
of entry into my house.

575
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:00,360
Please, don't take it personally.

576
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:02,028
That's all right, Mr. Ingram.

577
00:31:02,064 --> 00:31:03,938
Special Agent MacLaren.

578
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:06,181
Have we ever met, Agent MacLaren?

579
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:08,368
Well, I usually remember

580
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:10,870
the people who decline to shake my hand.

581
00:31:10,905 --> 00:31:12,738
How do you close your business deals?

582
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:14,640
Through a legal representative.

583
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:17,067
And a large transfer of money.

584
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:19,044
I'm investigating the four bodies

585
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,212
that were found in the basement

586
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:22,114
of the building at 46 Henderson Avenue.

587
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,649
Why are you speaking to me?

588
00:31:23,685 --> 00:31:25,985
One of your companies owns the property.

589
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,788
I suppose, on paper,
that's technically true,

590
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:30,755
though I think the company
that leased it from me

591
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:32,358
would be better able to provide you

592
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:34,526
with the day-to-day operations.

593
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:35,927
Have you spoken to them?

594
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:37,229
Not yet.

595
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:39,331
If an employee of a Microsoft store

596
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:42,201
was involved in a criminal act,
even a serious one,

597
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:45,170
would most FBI agents think
to question Bill Gates?

598
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:46,337
The four victims

599
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:48,139
were tortured extensively

600
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:50,274
and over an extended period of time,

601
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,076
so I hope you won't take it personally

602
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,345
if I'm being thorough.

603
00:31:54,381 --> 00:31:56,948
Well, I don't know
how much use I can be.

604
00:31:56,984 --> 00:31:59,217
I've never seen the building
or stepped foot inside,

605
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,887
and I operate
all of my business remotely.

606
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,754
I never leave this house.

607
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:04,983
Never?

608
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:07,742
My therapist encourages me to be blunt.

609
00:32:08,161 --> 00:32:10,661
I'm agoraphobic, germophobic,

610
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:12,859
and I don't like personal contact.

611
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,660
Well, I'm very sorry
that I have to be here.

612
00:32:14,695 --> 00:32:16,228
You don't.

613
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,997
You're naturally curious
about the wealthy recluse,

614
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,266
and your badge gets you in my door.

615
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:23,034
That is blunt.

616
00:32:23,069 --> 00:32:25,937
Please, ask your question
and get this over with.

617
00:32:28,074 --> 00:32:29,140
You founded

618
00:32:29,176 --> 00:32:31,610
one of the leading
digital security firms.

619
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,312
I am curious,

620
00:32:33,347 --> 00:32:34,780
why are you so strict

621
00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:37,581
about outside electronics in your home?

622
00:32:37,617 --> 00:32:39,083
Well, despite the best precautions,

623
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,018
Agent MacLaren,

624
00:32:40,053 --> 00:32:42,153
privacy is an illusion.

625
00:32:42,652 --> 00:32:44,355
With cameras and microphones

626
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:46,573
built into every personal device...

627
00:32:47,741 --> 00:32:50,161
My therapist says I'm paranoid,

628
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:51,729
but I think it's human nature

629
00:32:51,764 --> 00:32:52,996
for us to do anything

630
00:32:53,032 --> 00:32:55,766
to protect ourselves and our families.

631
00:32:55,802 --> 00:32:57,034
Dad?

632
00:32:57,584 --> 00:32:58,836
I'm just finishing up a meeting.

633
00:32:58,871 --> 00:32:59,704
Go...

634
00:32:59,739 --> 00:33:01,160
put your coat on.

635
00:33:01,516 --> 00:33:03,089
I'll be out there shortly.

636
00:33:08,428 --> 00:33:09,346
I try to reserve

637
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:11,614
a couple of hours every day
to play with my son.

638
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,283
Do you have children?

639
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:14,818
No.

640
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,109
Well, I'm sure

641
00:33:16,145 --> 00:33:18,055
there's still time
for you and your wife.

642
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,427
I remember now!

643
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:28,531
We met five years ago
at a charity event.

644
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:31,634
It was before my condition
became so debilitating.

645
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:33,161
You were there with your wife...

646
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,971
Kathryn.

647
00:33:35,371 --> 00:33:38,040
Sorry... didn't recognize you.

648
00:33:38,076 --> 00:33:40,293
A stunning woman, if I remember it.

649
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,979
With dark hair,
and a wonderful dance partner.

650
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:44,190
In your shoes,

651
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:45,982
I would never have let a single soul

652
00:33:46,017 --> 00:33:47,759
steal a dance from her.

653
00:33:48,522 --> 00:33:50,678
Please send her my regards.

654
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:54,556
That is, if our business is concluded.

655
00:33:55,693 --> 00:33:57,293
It is.

656
00:33:57,328 --> 00:33:59,862
For now. Thanks for your time.

657
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:02,998
Happy hunting.

658
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:07,302
The event would've been five years ago.

659
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:10,906
Liberty Banquet Hall.

660
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:12,340
Looks fancy.

661
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:13,776
I have no idea,

662
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,343
but I'd be on the guest list.

663
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:17,845
"MacLaren plus guest."

664
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,815
That's you.

665
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,218
Yeah.

666
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,486
Okay. Look for Vincent Ingram.

667
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:33,327
There's no sign he was there.

668
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,762
Doesn't mean he wasn't.

669
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:36,731
Can you hack into his private server?

670
00:34:37,392 --> 00:34:39,366
You know it.

671
00:34:39,402 --> 00:34:40,735
How you doing? What's that? What's that?

672
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:44,338
Jeff!

673
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,540
We did it.

674
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,607
We deserve to celebrate. You...

675
00:34:47,643 --> 00:34:49,709
deserve...

676
00:34:49,745 --> 00:34:51,211
to celebrate.

677
00:34:51,247 --> 00:34:52,646
You made a promise.

678
00:34:53,074 --> 00:34:54,514
A couple hours ago, we didn't know

679
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,851
if we ever were going
to see our son again.

680
00:34:57,886 --> 00:35:00,087
Come on, I'm just trying
to say thank you.

681
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,899
Hey, big boy!

682
00:35:12,935 --> 00:35:14,304
Hey!

683
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:16,636
Come here. Come here.

684
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:21,374
I miss you.

685
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:28,314
Redundancy number six?

686
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:31,250
That's just excessive.

687
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:32,418
Just try again.

688
00:35:32,454 --> 00:35:34,587
The Director didn't order us
to investigate this guy.

689
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:36,422
We're breaking Protocol 5 by doing this.

690
00:35:36,458 --> 00:35:38,724
As far as I'm concerned,
this falls under Protocol 1...

691
00:35:38,759 --> 00:35:40,025
The mission comes first.

692
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,094
The whole grand plan's in jeopardy

693
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:43,696
if we can't stop teams from being taken!

694
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:45,097
Now, maybe this guy
didn't pull the trigger,

695
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:47,566
but if he's involved in any way...

696
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:48,734
He froze me out.

697
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:51,403
That's redundancy number 7.

698
00:35:51,438 --> 00:35:53,105
I thought you said you could do this!

699
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,906
There's a reason why
he's the best in the 21st.

700
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:56,174
Shouldn't you be the best,

701
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:58,643
considering the century you come from?

702
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:00,379
Hey, look.

703
00:36:00,414 --> 00:36:02,447
Yelling at it worked.

704
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:21,966
Oh, my God.

705
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:27,709
Wow.

706
00:36:30,381 --> 00:36:31,673
You look...

707
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,783
I can't even finish my sentence.

708
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,085
That seems to be going around.

709
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:40,488
Hi.

710
00:36:40,523 --> 00:36:42,057
Hi.

711
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:43,925
Uh, Blair just texted

712
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:44,993
that she's running a little late,

713
00:36:45,028 --> 00:36:47,361
but the fish is ready,
so if you want to eat,

714
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:48,170
we could eat.

715
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:49,938
Uh, let's wait.

716
00:36:49,973 --> 00:36:52,110
Yeah, you know, we probably should.

717
00:36:53,303 --> 00:36:55,369
I wasn't, uh...

718
00:36:55,698 --> 00:36:58,204
I wasn't sure if you were
actually gonna come.

719
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,741
Well, you invited me.

720
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,345
How's your therapy been going?

721
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,146
No more panic attacks.

722
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:08,816
I still find it hard to fall asleep

723
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,420
when I'm in bed with Blair, but...

724
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,286
You know, I didn't mean it like that.

725
00:37:14,256 --> 00:37:15,489
Not like we don't, we do,

726
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,624
but just, you know...

727
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:19,142
you know, not excessively,
just a normal frequency.

728
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:20,304
Not like...

729
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,125
What was I talking about?

730
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,456
How you can't sleep.

731
00:37:24,491 --> 00:37:25,412
Right!

732
00:37:25,447 --> 00:37:27,353
Uh, she snores.

733
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:34,508
Ahem.

734
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:36,689
Hey...

735
00:37:36,898 --> 00:37:38,765
would you do something for me?

736
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:40,613
Anything.

737
00:37:41,616 --> 00:37:43,202
Tell me about me.

738
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:46,019
Like, things you don't remember, or...?

739
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:50,960
Okay, um...

740
00:37:51,526 --> 00:37:53,588
I used to call you "Batgirl,"

741
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:56,004
from you running off at all hours,

742
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,863
fighting crime.

743
00:37:57,898 --> 00:37:59,135
Uh...

744
00:37:59,452 --> 00:38:01,419
you liked listening to country music.

745
00:38:01,602 --> 00:38:03,101
Which country?

746
00:38:03,137 --> 00:38:06,738
No, it's a... it's a genre.

747
00:38:06,774 --> 00:38:09,175
Um, you like honey
in your tea, but not...

748
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,943
No, I mean, uh, what I was like.

749
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:13,073
Oh. Okay.

750
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:14,442
Um...

751
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:17,403
stubborn.

752
00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:19,350
You drove me crazy sometimes.

753
00:38:19,386 --> 00:38:20,504
I'm not gonna lie to you.

754
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:23,454
Uh... fierce.

755
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,245
Little yell-y, now and then.

756
00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:30,595
Generally... amazing.

757
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:35,200
I'm not really sure
that's what I'm asking.

758
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:36,934
Um...

759
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:39,204
I'm just trying to find
the missing pieces.

760
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:42,473
All I tell you is what you did to me.

761
00:38:43,677 --> 00:38:45,609
How I felt

762
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:47,934
whenever you would walk
through the door...

763
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:52,146
every time.

764
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,316
Like butterflies...

765
00:38:56,455 --> 00:38:58,355
that feeling in your stomach.

766
00:38:59,124 --> 00:39:01,891
Even more so when you'd go out again.

767
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:08,037
Someone like you

768
00:39:09,468 --> 00:39:11,901
does not happen to someone like me.

769
00:39:14,106 --> 00:39:16,473
And I know that doesn't
answer your question

770
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:17,807
and I know that you're just
trying to remember

771
00:39:17,843 --> 00:39:19,575
the missing pieces, but...

772
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:23,479
Maybe someone is best defined

773
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:25,749
by how they affect
the people around them.

774
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:31,121
I think I just made that up,
but I think it may be true.

775
00:39:37,328 --> 00:39:38,661
Hey, guys.

776
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:41,797
Um, I'm so sorry I'm late.

777
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:43,031
That's okay. We were just, uh...

778
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:44,133
Marcy, Carly...

779
00:39:44,168 --> 00:39:46,569
I need you back at Ops, right now.

780
00:39:46,604 --> 00:39:50,676
Um, I actually need to go,
something just came up.

781
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:52,674
Oh. No, really?

782
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:53,697
You don't need to...

783
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:54,690
I do.

784
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,279
Um, thank you for the wine.

785
00:39:57,755 --> 00:39:58,925
Bye.

786
00:40:07,857 --> 00:40:10,224
There's a file for each of us.

787
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,460
I can't believe we found him.

788
00:40:14,864 --> 00:40:15,997
Open mine.

789
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:39,086
We take him tonight.

790
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:42,173
Before another Traveler dies.

791
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,692
You're fucking right we do.

792
00:40:45,421 --> 00:40:46,686
Let's gear up.

793
00:40:50,899 --> 00:40:52,766
Okay, we go in quiet and fast.

794
00:40:52,802 --> 00:40:54,067
Kill him and get out.

795
00:40:54,102 --> 00:40:55,336
Boss, I don't agree with this.

796
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:57,237
Yeah? Well, we're going to need you.

797
00:40:57,272 --> 00:40:58,771
How about you, Philip?

798
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:00,566
Oh, I'm in.

799
00:41:01,143 --> 00:41:03,776
All right, there are
four armed guards outside.

800
00:41:03,812 --> 00:41:05,278
Here, here, here, and here.

801
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:06,847
I don't know how many staff inside.

802
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:07,881
All right.

803
00:41:07,916 --> 00:41:09,549
Let's park behind this tree-line

804
00:41:09,584 --> 00:41:10,750
and proceed on foot.

805
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:12,185
And, after lunch,

806
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,186
Miss Henry let me read
from The Chrysalids.

807
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,789
She said I had
a very impressive vocabulary.

808
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:18,057
Go get it!

809
00:41:18,092 --> 00:41:19,559
Good for you.

810
00:41:19,594 --> 00:41:22,088
Come on. Come on, boy.

811
00:41:48,955 --> 00:41:50,756
Taylor?

812
00:41:50,791 --> 00:41:52,257
Good boy. Good boy. Come on.

813
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:54,158
Taylor!

814
00:41:54,194 --> 00:41:56,294
Not so far. Not so far!

815
00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:58,229
Come on.

816
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,399
Traveler 001...

817
00:42:02,068 --> 00:42:05,469
Traveler 3468, you are off-mission.

818
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:07,471
Stop your pursuit of Traveler 3468

819
00:42:07,507 --> 00:42:09,007
and his team immediately.

820
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:12,110
Stand down immediately
or face repercussions.

821
00:42:13,513 --> 00:42:15,846
Where's my mom?

822
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:20,518
Dad? What's wrong?

823
00:42:20,553 --> 00:42:21,852
Come back inside.

824
00:42:21,888 --> 00:42:23,421
Quickly. Quickly!

825
00:42:23,456 --> 00:42:25,088
It's all right, sweetheart.

826
00:42:25,124 --> 00:42:26,688
I'm a policeman.

827
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:27,958
Boss?

828
00:42:27,993 --> 00:42:29,226
What do we do?

829
00:42:34,801 --> 00:42:37,167
Taylor and I are leaving tonight.

830
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:39,403
We won't be returning.

831
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,272
Stand down.

832
00:42:42,308 --> 00:42:43,473
What?

833
00:42:43,508 --> 00:42:45,242
The Director must have a reason.

834
00:42:45,277 --> 00:42:46,776
The Director is the one
who wanted him found!

835
00:42:46,812 --> 00:42:48,678
We found him! Let's finish it!

836
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:50,880
It's not our mission.

837
00:42:50,916 --> 00:42:52,782
Not tonight.

838
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,320
Come on, sweetheart. Let's get you home.

839
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,860
Come on.

840
00:43:03,895 --> 00:43:04,994
Do you know your address?

841
00:43:58,074 --> 00:44:06,173
