1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,475
Previously on Travelers.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,599
We got a mission

3
00:00:02,624 --> 00:00:04,024
to save people who were
gonna die from the flu.

4
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:05,953
The Director's antiviral didn't work.

5
00:00:05,988 --> 00:00:07,054
That's impossible.

6
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:08,322
We're all infected, aren't we?

7
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:10,626
I want to go over the antiviral
data one more time.

8
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,659
Maybe we made a mistake.

9
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:12,727
I remember this,

10
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,462
but I don't remember writing it down.

11
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:15,762
How do you not remember?

12
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:16,897
What did you make me do?

13
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,598
The Director would never
order that mission.

14
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:20,700
Who said the mission
came from the Director?

15
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,437
So Forbes,
all those people with the FBI...

16
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:24,538
...Are all Faction?

17
00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:26,606
You're murdering over two billion people.

18
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:29,310
The mission comes first.

19
00:00:34,349 --> 00:00:36,550
Where's the quantum frame?

20
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:41,909
He asked you a question.

21
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,875
Pfft.

22
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,753
Do it. It's what I want anyway.

23
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:47,780
You've been doing what we want
for months,

24
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,014
why stop now?

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,750
How many members of the Faction are here?

26
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:53,819
It could be anybody we meet.

27
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:56,660
And there could be thousands
more in the quantum frame.

28
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:58,891
That's why the Director
wanted us to destroy it.

29
00:00:58,926 --> 00:01:01,526
The Director ordered
you to build the thing.

30
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,796
I mean, how can you people
not see the irony of that?

31
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,831
You just follow it blindly,
no matter what.

32
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,267
That's the difference between us.

33
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:10,369
No. The Faction abducts innocent people

34
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,570
and overwrites them.

35
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,405
That's the difference between us.

36
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,539
What you do is murder.

37
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,575
What you do is opportunism,

38
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,976
like taking hosts just before they die

39
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,177
is so ethical?

40
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,912
Yeah. That's exactly what it is.

41
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:22,113
Hey, guess what?

42
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,249
Everybody is going to die.

43
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,184
Some sooner than others.

44
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,451
When we're from,

45
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:29,788
everybody in the 21st is long gone,

46
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,455
and for what they did to this planet,

47
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:32,523
good riddance.

48
00:01:32,558 --> 00:01:34,592
Here's what's gonna happen, Jenny.

49
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,261
We're going to stop this pandemic,

50
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,461
and then we are gonna hunt down

51
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:40,431
every member of the Faction in the 21st.

52
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:42,199
The Director's shut down in the future,

53
00:01:42,234 --> 00:01:43,668
and most of your team will be dead

54
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,669
in less than two weeks,

55
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,473
so good luck.

If you're done questioning her,

58
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:10,593
I'd like to take a few tissue samples,

59
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:11,994
run some tests.

60
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,063
Please. Whatever you need to do.

61
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:18,935
We should send out
an S.O.S. on the deep web

62
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,204
and let other Travelers
know what's going on.

63
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:23,573
They'll be monitoring our backchannels.

64
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:26,445
If the Faction's overwritten
every single federal agent

65
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,277
that was in that room
with the quantum frame,

66
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:30,146
I don't have those assets to use either.

67
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,881
Okay, this is not that complicated.

68
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:33,983
I'm saying

69
00:02:34,018 --> 00:02:35,784
the Director can fix this.

70
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,593
We need to fix the Director.

71
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:40,689
The Director exists in the future.

72
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,058
And its reactor is already shut down.

73
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:43,625
Those are big problems, Grace.

74
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:45,627
The plan's already in place.

75
00:02:45,663 --> 00:02:47,730
When it became apparent
that the grand plan

76
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:49,798
would take longer than
our initial projections,

77
00:02:49,834 --> 00:02:51,166
the Director sent a team

78
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:54,336
to refine uranium as fuel
to extend its operational life.

79
00:02:54,372 --> 00:02:56,605
A few kilos would be enough.

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,206
All we have to do

81
00:02:58,242 --> 00:03:00,141
is take the fuel to the location

82
00:03:00,177 --> 00:03:01,977
where the Director
will eventually be built,

83
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:03,478
and it'll be there when the time comes.

84
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:05,023
Without the Faction knowing.

85
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:06,281
How the hell are we gonna do that?

86
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:08,116
Whoa! They outsmarted us!

87
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:09,584
Whoop-dee-doo! Get over it!

88
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:11,586
They can't outsmart the Director.

89
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,522
Even if we can just get it
back online for a few seconds,

90
00:03:14,557 --> 00:03:16,624
that's all the time
it'll need to take back control.

91
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:18,693
And you know where this uranium is?

92
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,753
Pull up a map.

93
00:04:16,284 --> 00:04:17,250
Oh!

94
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:19,033
It's hot in there.

95
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:21,520
Ever think you'd hear yourself
complain about the heat?

96
00:04:21,556 --> 00:04:23,149
No.

97
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:24,890
Radiation, maybe.

98
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:27,560
You really want to lose another game?

99
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,033
Who the hell is that?

100
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,819
Who are you?

101
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,520
I'm 4112.

102
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:57,964
What're you doing here?

103
00:04:57,989 --> 00:04:59,190
I just received orders

104
00:04:59,225 --> 00:05:01,058
to provide backup at this location.

105
00:05:01,753 --> 00:05:03,060
You can lower your gun.

106
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:07,465
Backup for what?

107
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:09,767
Damn. I was kind of
hoping you could tell me.

108
00:05:09,803 --> 00:05:10,768
I'm sorry, guys,

109
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:12,069
squeaky little kid took me by surprise

110
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:13,471
when she first started talking.

111
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:14,972
I missed the whole first part.

112
00:05:15,008 --> 00:05:16,573
Yeah, messengers are weird.

113
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:19,343
Yeah, she said something
about uranium, maybe?

114
00:05:19,608 --> 00:05:20,773
Yeah, you heard right.

115
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:22,007
We're refining it.

116
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:23,876
Fuel for the Director.

117
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:25,511
So how the hell

118
00:05:25,547 --> 00:05:26,646
do you guys get it to the future?

119
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:27,647
We don't.

120
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:29,314
Yeah, we make it here in the 21st,

121
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,315
then we put it away for the Director

122
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:31,316
to find it in a few hundred years.

123
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:32,317
Yeah, we're right on schedule,

124
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:33,853
so I don't know what we need backup for.

125
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:35,121
Yeah?

126
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:39,024
How much have you produced?

127
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,294
2.4 kilos.

128
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:43,462
Why... Why did you do that?

129
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:44,993
Show me where.

130
00:05:45,633 --> 00:05:46,778
Thank you.

131
00:05:50,313 --> 00:05:51,673
We're clear.

132
00:05:58,673 --> 00:05:59,944
It's in there.

133
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,348
Take it all.

134
00:06:08,155 --> 00:06:09,520
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

135
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:10,922
Shh...

136
00:06:12,292 --> 00:06:13,892
It's okay.

137
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:18,313
Hello?

138
00:06:18,838 --> 00:06:20,004
Hey, Sarge.

139
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:22,966
Yeah, no, I'm sorry, my son's sick,

140
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:24,835
and I had to, uh...

141
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,236
Yeah, no, no, I understand.

142
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:29,713
Yeah, I'll come down as soon
as his mom gets home.

143
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:32,073
Okay. Thanks, Sarge.

144
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:37,080
Yeah. That's it.

145
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:38,982
...yet to be named virus.

146
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:42,452
It has infected thousands
of people around the world,

147
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:43,854
with the highest infection rates

148
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:45,355
among the most vulnerable:

149
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,825
pregnant women, children, the elderly,

150
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,559
and those with lowered immune systems.

151
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:51,795
Many are turning to emergency rooms

152
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,857
in hopes of treatment,

153
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:56,098
but infection rates are on the rise,

154
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:59,769
with nearly every hospital bed
in the city now occupied.

155
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,806
The mayor is expected
to make a statement shortly,

156
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,642
however, the epidemic
has city and state authorities

157
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:09,378
suggesting that everyone
stay in their homes.

158
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:23,125
What did he do to me?

159
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:25,394
We just took some blood
and tissue samples.

160
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:27,496
You're still intact.

161
00:07:30,793 --> 00:07:32,801
You understand, don't you?

162
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:35,412
No.

163
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:36,613
You used me.

164
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:38,748
Look, come on.

165
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:39,984
I was on a mission, just like you.

166
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:41,617
We want the same thing.

167
00:07:41,652 --> 00:07:44,454
We just go about it a different way.

168
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:47,090
We forget about...

169
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,126
the protocols and the Director,
and all those limitations,

170
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:52,328
and we just do what needs to be done,

171
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:53,630
what's right.

172
00:07:54,161 --> 00:07:56,500
Like Calloway and Aleksander.

173
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:57,800
That's very different

174
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,602
than murdering almost
a third of the population.

175
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:02,022
To save everyone else.

176
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,413
Not a bargain I can make.

177
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,641
Well, it's done.

178
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:07,610
There's no going back now.

179
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,178
We're not giving up just yet.

180
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:10,679
You should.

181
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:13,449
Your people won't be able to stop this,

182
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,601
and there's nothing an historian can do.

183
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:19,161
Just think about
the time you've got left.

184
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:21,953
Let's get out of here.

185
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:22,929
When I found you,

186
00:08:22,964 --> 00:08:24,564
you had swallowed a bottle of pills.

187
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:26,366
Why?

188
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:27,641
Guilt?

189
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,970
I feel no guilt at all.

190
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:32,772
This is for the greater good,

191
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:34,908
and I can't believe you don't see that!

192
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:36,810
Then why the pills?

193
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:37,977
Because I was trying to end it

194
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:39,745
before the virus ran its course.

195
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:41,494
You feel sick now.

196
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,949
It's only gonna get worse.

197
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:44,050
This virus is designed

198
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:45,418
to keep the infected alive

199
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:46,619
as long as possible...

200
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:48,317
to help the spread,

201
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:49,622
make the authorities think

202
00:08:49,657 --> 00:08:51,984
that it's not as serious as it really is.

203
00:08:52,353 --> 00:08:54,171
So when people start to really die,

204
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:55,661
it's too late.

205
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:58,096
And the last days of it

206
00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:00,966
are not something I want to go through.

207
00:09:07,112 --> 00:09:08,845
Well, now you're gonna suffer...

208
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,811
Along with everyone else...

209
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:15,113
for every last minute.

210
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:34,699
They're keeping a pretty low profile.

211
00:09:34,735 --> 00:09:36,000
I think that's the idea.

212
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:38,469
Okay.

213
00:09:38,504 --> 00:09:40,804
Watch our six and listen in on com.

214
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,706
Copy that.

215
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:54,485
Who is it?

216
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,689
3468, on a Protocol Alpha mission.

217
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,168
3224. What's going on?

218
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:06,826
We need to pull up the delivery.

219
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:07,927
It's urgent.

220
00:10:07,962 --> 00:10:09,028
Is this a joke?

221
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:10,228
No.

222
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:13,098
The reactor won't need
more fuel for hundreds of years.

223
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:15,267
It's the here and now
we're worried about.

224
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:16,435
This "flu" that's going around

225
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,536
is about to become a pandemic.

226
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:18,604
And what's that got to do with us?

227
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,339
Let's talk inside, shall we?

228
00:10:28,982 --> 00:10:31,582
All we have is in the lab down the hall.

229
00:10:31,618 --> 00:10:32,617
But I still don't see

230
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:35,187
what refined uranium
has to do with a pandemic.

231
00:10:35,222 --> 00:10:36,288
Boss, this guy picked

232
00:10:36,323 --> 00:10:37,322
the wrong random Traveler number.

233
00:10:37,357 --> 00:10:39,291
3224 died six months ago.

234
00:10:39,326 --> 00:10:41,759
These guys are all Faction.

235
00:10:41,795 --> 00:10:43,494
Well, I wish I could
tell you the whole plan,

236
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,697
but, you know... protocol two.

237
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:46,931
No.

238
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,633
I don't know.

239
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,477
I'm gonna need more.

240
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:51,430
Like what?

241
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:52,509
Something in writing?

242
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:54,509
The Director isn't good enough for you?

243
00:10:54,545 --> 00:10:56,268
You could be pretending
to be somebody else.

244
00:10:56,303 --> 00:10:57,927
I am pretending to be somebody else.

245
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,771
It's in the job description.
Are you new here?

246
00:10:59,806 --> 00:11:01,072
No.

247
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,641
I just don't want to see uranium
fall into the wrong hands.

248
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:04,776
Well, neither do we.

249
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:07,513
Hands on your head.

250
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:14,201
Door.

251
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,318
Show him where it is.

252
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:24,641
Long gone. Have a look for yourself.

253
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,081
Trev?

254
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:33,979
Any of your team
showing any symptoms yet?

255
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:36,433
You look like you're in the early stages.

256
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:37,424
Where did you take it?

257
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:38,581
Even if I told you,
the others would know,

258
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:40,907
and they'd just move it to a safe place.

259
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:42,647
Some of them are on their way here now.

260
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:44,048
You're more than welcome to wait.

261
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,161
No sign of uranium in the lab.

262
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:53,023
Shit!

263
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:54,224
Feel better?

264
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,292
No.

265
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:56,493
I do.

266
00:11:56,528 --> 00:11:58,495
Come on.

267
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:08,670
This been tested?

268
00:12:08,706 --> 00:12:09,939
Soup's safe, Bob.

269
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:10,940
I promise.

270
00:12:10,975 --> 00:12:12,108
How'd you know my name?

271
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,843
Why does no one ever
recognize me with this thing on?

272
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:15,978
It's me.

273
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:17,146
David?

274
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:18,568
You shouldn't be here.

275
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:20,216
Well, where else would I be?

276
00:12:20,251 --> 00:12:21,377
All my friends are here.

277
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:26,889
Soup's delicious. I tested it myself.

278
00:12:26,924 --> 00:12:27,890
It'll make you strong

279
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:29,291
and fight that bug that's going around.

280
00:12:37,902 --> 00:12:39,867
I've got to get back to my team.

281
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:41,903
I've done about all I can
for Boyd at this point.

282
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:45,206
I wanted to give you these.

283
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:47,175
They're not programmed
to affect the viral load,

284
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,144
but if she starts to go
into organ failure,

285
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:51,014
they might buy you some time.

286
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:51,962
Thank you.

287
00:12:51,997 --> 00:12:53,888
Aren't nanites by directive only?

288
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:55,349
Well, with the Director down,

289
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:57,552
I figure the discretion falls on me.

290
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,116
Boyd's a good medic. We could use her.

291
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:01,656
We'll do what we can.

292
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:03,190
Good luck.

293
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:06,527
I'd be willing to trade information

294
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:08,718
in exchange for those nanites.

295
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,364
I thought you wanted to die.

296
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,366
Not if the cure's right in front of me.

297
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,367
I'm not stupid.

298
00:13:13,402 --> 00:13:15,502
You're the control. You get nothing.

299
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,352
- Well?
- There was no uranium.

300
00:13:18,388 --> 00:13:19,873
Just the Faction...

301
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:21,442
waiting for us.

302
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:24,611
Why are you looking at me like that?

303
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:25,871
You're the one that sent us there.

304
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:28,348
Aw, that is so insulting.

305
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:29,583
Yes, I did!

306
00:13:29,618 --> 00:13:32,752
Because we absolutely need it
and time is short.

307
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:34,554
You need to find out
where it is and go get it.

308
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,956
They're a step ahead of us, at least.

309
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,378
We need another option.

310
00:13:37,413 --> 00:13:38,792
There aren't any other options!

311
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:40,259
We need to get the Director back online.

312
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:43,396
The Faction has been
planning this for a long time.

313
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:44,930
So we gotta think outside the box.

314
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:46,432
There's a military base

315
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:47,533
just north of here.

316
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:48,968
N.S. Wallace.

317
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:50,436
You're thinking nuclear weapons?

318
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:52,963
That's nowhere near the box, Philip.

319
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:55,308
But that's ideal,
from a fuel perspective.

320
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:56,876
A few hundred years is nothing

321
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,878
compared to the half-life of plutonium.

322
00:13:58,913 --> 00:14:00,046
It would be difficult.

323
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:01,380
Closer to impossible!

324
00:14:01,415 --> 00:14:04,049
And if we've thought about it,
then Faction probably has too.

325
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,268
Well...

326
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:10,068
doesn't sound like
we have much of a choice.

327
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:15,961
I got you some groceries

328
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:18,863
so you don't have to go out
for the next few days.

329
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,932
The store was a madhouse.

330
00:14:21,588 --> 00:14:23,835
I heard there's looting going on.

331
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,970
Yeah, a few assholes.

332
00:14:26,428 --> 00:14:28,006
How're you feeling?

333
00:14:28,042 --> 00:14:29,408
I'm okay.

334
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,443
Hot. Headache.

335
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,388
Temperature's up near 100.

336
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,548
Let's cool you down.

337
00:14:38,818 --> 00:14:41,252
The news said this was an epidemic.

338
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,068
Is it really that bad?

339
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:47,025
Hopefully that's
a bit of an overreaction.

340
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,059
Doctor, what can you
tell me about the virus?

341
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:49,093
What is it?

342
00:14:49,128 --> 00:14:50,294
We're not sure yet.

343
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:51,462
They're working on it.

344
00:14:51,497 --> 00:14:52,948
But you...

345
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:56,200
are sick, and you need to rest.

346
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:57,468
So much so,

347
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,958
that while many of the symptoms
match the common flu...

348
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:02,093
What do you know?

349
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:04,675
How sick am I?

350
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:08,148
Grant?

351
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:11,281
I don't know.

352
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:13,650
Okay, what do we do?

353
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,518
The safest place for you is right here.

354
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:17,754
"Safest"? Okay,
now you're starting to scare me.

355
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,590
Maybe we should go to the hospital.

356
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,358
Not where you want to be right now.

357
00:15:23,395 --> 00:15:24,827
Look.

358
00:15:25,622 --> 00:15:26,463
The next couple days,

359
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:27,897
it's gonna be hard for me to get home.

360
00:15:27,932 --> 00:15:29,031
Couple of days?

361
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:30,066
I will try to...

362
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:32,135
What about you? You're gonna be exposed.

363
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,336
I've got to support

364
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:35,371
the people who are trying to solve this.

365
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,808
And you've got to take
your meds and rest,

366
00:15:38,843 --> 00:15:40,509
and give your body...

367
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:41,510
and that baby

368
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:43,545
the fuel that they need.

369
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:47,548
Okay? That means fresh fruit,
not salted meat.

370
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:54,890
Do you have to go so soon?

371
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:55,992
The sooner I go,

372
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:57,348
the sooner I come back.

373
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:02,736
I love you.

374
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:12,274
So?

375
00:16:12,309 --> 00:16:13,908
Took all night, but they're done.

376
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:15,209
Good work.

377
00:16:15,245 --> 00:16:16,544
How's everybody holding up?

378
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:17,578
We can nap in the car.

379
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:18,613
When I left, you were afraid

380
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,314
the device wouldn't have enough range.

381
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,883
Yeah, we fixed that.

382
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:23,118
How does it know when to activate?

383
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:24,886
Well, the Director is programmed

384
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:26,888
to broadcast an emergency signal

385
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:28,256
if it's ever powered down.

386
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:29,590
Which should trigger the device

387
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:30,591
and activate it.

388
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:31,592
"Should"?

389
00:16:32,228 --> 00:16:33,794
Do you want me to go over
a list of things

390
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:34,795
that could go wrong with this plan?

391
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,497
No, thank you.

392
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:37,965
It'll work, boss.

393
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,099
We're good to go.

394
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:40,635
All right, then let's gear up.

395
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,148
Road trip!

396
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:44,372
How is she?

397
00:16:45,369 --> 00:16:46,306
Uh...

398
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:47,808
Her viral load's holding steady,

399
00:16:47,843 --> 00:16:49,409
but she's not getting any better.

400
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:51,311
The nanites will help, right?

401
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:52,612
Could help.

402
00:16:52,648 --> 00:16:54,214
Could make things worse.

403
00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:55,615
The Faction planned this well.

404
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:57,584
It's hard to know what contingencies

405
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:58,919
they've thought of.

406
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:02,068
Use Grace as you see fit,
but keep your eye on her.

407
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:05,148
And... take care.

408
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:08,094
You too.

409
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,903
Hey, Bob?

410
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:19,072
I brought you some soup.

411
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:21,741
Bob?

412
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:24,143
Bob?

413
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,411
Bob!

414
00:17:27,341 --> 00:17:28,407
Oh no!

415
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:39,991
Hey, Carly, it's me.
I'm getting worried about you.

416
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,494
About Jeffrey...

417
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:46,265
Listen, I'm sick as shit. Please...

418
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,533
Call me, let me know where you are,

419
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:48,534
that you're okay.

420
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:51,637
Your son says "hi" too.

421
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,989
You're a hypocrite.

422
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,124
You're all high and mighty

423
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:16,127
about sacrificing lives
to save the future,

424
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,463
and then treat me like a lab rat.

425
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,732
You did this to yourself.

426
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,702
This is a waste of resources.

427
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,703
I should be programming the nanites.

428
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,505
- Not yet.
- Why not?

429
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,573
Because I want to see

430
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,975
if the anti-serum will work first.

431
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:31,976
I'm close.

432
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,477
Boyd will be dead before you're done!

433
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,398
Well, she's my patient.

434
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:36,895
We both know,

435
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:37,982
in the time we come from,

436
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,583
medical nanites more or less replace you.

437
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,985
Okay, if you want to be helpful,

438
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,219
why don't you use your computer
and hack into the CDC

439
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,888
and find out what kind
of progress they've made.

440
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,022
The who?

441
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:48,091
Hack into them too, if you'd like.

442
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,527
Like either the Center
for Disease Control

443
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,262
or the World Health Organization
is gonna know how to deal

444
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,097
with a virus designed in the future?

445
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,433
Let's contact the 15th century
and hire an exorcist!

446
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,534
Would you just please stop talking?

447
00:18:58,569 --> 00:18:59,568
You little power-tripper.

448
00:18:59,604 --> 00:19:01,704
I am trying to save your life!

449
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:08,644
Well, you're not doing a very good job.

450
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
I feel awful.

451
00:19:11,228 --> 00:19:12,381
Where are you going?

452
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:16,018
To the bathroom.

453
00:19:58,127 --> 00:20:00,094
Hi. We're, uh...

454
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:01,963
This is a designated exit, sir.

455
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:04,031
Oh.

456
00:20:04,067 --> 00:20:05,266
Sorry. Uh...

457
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:06,828
W...

458
00:20:10,806 --> 00:20:12,273
What's he doing?

459
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:13,440
Just his job.

460
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,808
Everybody relax.

461
00:20:15,588 --> 00:20:17,611
All these guys could be Faction.

462
00:20:17,646 --> 00:20:18,880
If it goes down,

463
00:20:18,915 --> 00:20:20,214
I'll take the booth guard.

464
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,948
Easy! We're not gonna get our warhead

465
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:23,917
if we start shooting people.

466
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,026
We're trapped in here,

467
00:20:33,061 --> 00:20:34,094
and there's cameras everywhere.

468
00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:36,397
Everybody, calm the hell down.

469
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:42,936
Base is under quarantine, sir.

470
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:44,271
I'm aware of that.

471
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:47,173
I'm Special Agent
Grant MacLaren from the FBI.

472
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:48,942
I've got a meeting with Captain Garcia

473
00:20:48,977 --> 00:20:51,244
on urgent business.

474
00:20:54,908 --> 00:20:56,482
All appointments have been canceled...

475
00:20:56,518 --> 00:20:58,618
Vice Admiral Donahue
arranged the meeting,

476
00:20:58,653 --> 00:21:01,353
so I assure you, the meeting
has not been canceled.

477
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:02,908
Check again.

478
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:12,543
Carly.

479
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,576
I see it here now, sir.

480
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:27,512
Great. And the gate?

481
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:29,514
Just waiting
for your passes to print, sir.

482
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:34,453
Building four.

483
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:35,887
On your right.

484
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,988
Appreciate it.

485
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,134
What?

486
00:22:00,135 --> 00:22:01,174
You all right?

487
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,341
No, I'm dying,

488
00:22:02,342 --> 00:22:05,242
but I still need to go
to the bathroom periodically.

489
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,246
Well, you've been in there for a while.

490
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,246
I was just concerned.

491
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:14,918
I'm fine!

492
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:46,024
Did you see where she put the nanites?

493
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:49,070
In there.

494
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:16,887
What're you doing?

495
00:23:16,923 --> 00:23:18,030
Shh.

496
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:21,637
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

497
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,475
Captain Garcia?

498
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,810
Special Agent MacLaven from the FBI.

499
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:42,945
It's "MacLaren."

500
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,547
Your pass says "MacLaven".

501
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:46,815
Agent MacLaren
knows his name, Ms. Jackson.

502
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:48,217
Should I issue a new pass?

503
00:23:48,253 --> 00:23:50,853
He won't be here that long. You can go.

504
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:53,129
That doesn't sound promising.

505
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:55,323
It is what it is.

506
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,948
I'm sure the Admiral relayed
the urgency of our request.

507
00:23:57,949 --> 00:24:00,983
And your pass says MacLaven.
People make mistakes.

508
00:24:01,018 --> 00:24:02,552
Our request isn't one of them.

509
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,688
How does that particular warhead

510
00:24:05,724 --> 00:24:07,690
possibly help prevent a pandemic?

511
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:09,559
I'm not authorized to explain.

512
00:24:09,594 --> 00:24:12,161
Shame. I'd pay good money to hear it.

513
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,263
While you're deciding
whether to help us or not,

514
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:17,166
a deadly virus is spreading worldwide.

515
00:24:17,201 --> 00:24:18,700
You're being a little
melodramatic, aren't you?

516
00:24:18,736 --> 00:24:20,202
The flu kills people every year.

517
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:22,238
It's far worse than what's been reported.

518
00:24:22,273 --> 00:24:24,240
There are millions of
people infected already,

519
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:25,707
even if they haven't
presented symptoms yet.

520
00:24:25,743 --> 00:24:27,440
And it's spreading exponentially.

521
00:24:27,475 --> 00:24:28,710
The Admiral's email said

522
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:30,512
you'd be coming in with CDC personnel.

523
00:24:30,547 --> 00:24:32,077
Is that supposed to be you?

524
00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:33,548
They're specialists.

525
00:24:33,584 --> 00:24:34,783
Uh-huh.

526
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:37,051
This is making less and less sense

527
00:24:37,087 --> 00:24:38,186
the more I hear.

528
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:40,288
If you'd like to call
the Admiral, I'm sure...

529
00:24:40,323 --> 00:24:41,690
Not necessary.

530
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:43,124
My orders were clear.

531
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,595
The warhead is being separated
from the torpedo as we speak,

532
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,630
for what good that could possibly do.

533
00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:52,267
It's being loaded
directly into your vehicle.

534
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,602
I just don't like
ordnance leaving my base

535
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:55,803
without an explanation.

536
00:24:55,838 --> 00:24:56,804
Trust me when I say

537
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,472
you're helping to save millions of lives.

538
00:24:58,508 --> 00:24:59,874
I hope I'm one of them.

539
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:00,875
I feel like shit,

540
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,342
and so do half the people on my base.

541
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:03,544
I will personally make sure

542
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:04,779
that the people on this base

543
00:25:04,814 --> 00:25:06,447
are among the first
to receive the antidote

544
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:08,048
once it's ready.

545
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:37,870
David.

546
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,011
You should go home.

547
00:25:40,047 --> 00:25:41,932
Yeah, I'm just gonna sit for a bit.

548
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:43,716
You've done your fair share.

549
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:46,385
Government's getting serious.
There's looting going on.

550
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,510
Looting?

551
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:54,827
I saw a movie a few months back

552
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:56,862
where something like this happened.

553
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,797
It was very believable.

554
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:01,070
But I never bought the looting.

555
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:03,502
"Hey everyone's getting sick,

556
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:04,703
so let's...

557
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:07,105
let's break that window
and steal that TV."

558
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,306
I-I don't get that.

559
00:26:08,342 --> 00:26:09,698
Me neither.

560
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,742
I mean, you get a pretty decent TV

561
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:12,010
for next to nothing nowadays,

562
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:14,312
compared to what I got mine for? God.

563
00:26:14,348 --> 00:26:15,313
David.

564
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:16,548
The expensive part is the cable.

565
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:17,716
David...

566
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:18,951
Go home.

567
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:21,720
Yeah.

568
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,123
No, I-I'm waiting for Marcy to come by.

569
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,695
Maybe I should go home.

570
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,230
It's a good idea.

571
00:27:14,573 --> 00:27:16,873
I should've swung that friggin' ax.

572
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:18,241
Forbes would've shot you.

573
00:27:18,276 --> 00:27:21,630
30% of the human population...

574
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,080
Including all of you.

575
00:27:24,115 --> 00:27:25,448
Boss, you can't blame yourself

576
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:28,084
for not being able
to foresee the unthinkable.

577
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,852
That's why they call it "unthinkable".

578
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,187
Can't think it.

579
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:32,855
Still, I know how you feel.

580
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,550
I'm the one that provided
the Faction with the virus.

581
00:27:35,586 --> 00:27:36,759
You were drugged.

582
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,727
Again.

583
00:27:38,763 --> 00:27:39,929
Stop. It's done.

584
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,590
You know, I've been wondering about that.

585
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,400
Maybe the Director can undo this.

586
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,769
How?

587
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,071
The future can only send
a consciousness back

588
00:27:49,106 --> 00:27:51,677
as far as
the most recent Traveler, right?

589
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,409
And Travelers are arriving all the time,

590
00:27:54,445 --> 00:27:55,578
all over the world,

591
00:27:55,613 --> 00:27:57,590
as part of the grand plan...

592
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,983
but the last one
had to have been months ago...

593
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,386
before the Director went down,

594
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,221
before all this happened.

595
00:28:06,256 --> 00:28:09,057
The Faction might not be able
to send consciousness back

596
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,559
or establish a T.E.L.L.,

597
00:28:10,594 --> 00:28:11,960
but messengers count.

598
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,163
It's still a transfer
of information from the future.

599
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:17,899
He's right.

600
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,968
Messengers cause
the same ripples in space-time

601
00:28:20,003 --> 00:28:20,969
as Travelers.

602
00:28:21,004 --> 00:28:21,970
And we know

603
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:23,805
the Faction has sent messengers recently.

604
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,373
They thought of everything.

605
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:31,178
Well, guys, on the bright side...

606
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,347
We're almost home.

607
00:28:41,606 --> 00:28:43,539
Hard to believe
where we're walking right now

608
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:45,841
is under a kilometer of ice
in a few hundred years.

609
00:28:45,877 --> 00:28:48,677
The domes get built right over there.

610
00:28:48,712 --> 00:28:50,079
We've only ever seen the shelters

611
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:51,619
from the inside.

612
00:29:26,636 --> 00:29:27,868
What's wrong?

613
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:29,269
What's wrong?

614
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:33,979
Aw, shit. Marcy!

615
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:47,453
What happened?

616
00:29:47,489 --> 00:29:48,755
She shouldn't be
having respiratory issues

617
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,756
at this stage.

618
00:29:49,791 --> 00:29:51,223
You didn't trust me. I had no choice.

619
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:52,558
What'd you do?

620
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,960
I instructed
the nanites to pull the virus

621
00:29:54,996 --> 00:29:57,029
into red blood cells,
where it can't survive.

622
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:58,063
She should be getting better.

623
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:00,531
The Faction predicted
that countermeasure.

624
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,400
The virus blocks red blood cells' ability

625
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:03,401
to carry oxygen.

626
00:30:03,436 --> 00:30:04,502
She's suffocating.

627
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:05,503
Turn them off!

628
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:06,537
Deactivating the nanites

629
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:07,872
will be like flushing them
down the drain!

630
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:09,874
Turn them off or she's gonna die.

631
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:12,076
Either way, they're useless now.

632
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,422
There, she's better.

633
00:30:24,457 --> 00:30:25,989
No, she's not better!

634
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:27,725
She's right back to where she started.

635
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:29,326
They've been ahead of us this whole time.

636
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,229
Did you not think the Faction
was gonna factor in nanites?

637
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,197
This is all because you didn't trust me!

638
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,832
Why should I?

639
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,267
You're alive because of me.

640
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:38,835
And perfectly healthy.

641
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,537
Am I?

642
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,039
When you reset me,

643
00:30:42,512 --> 00:30:44,107
you left out some things.

644
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:45,208
What'd you leave out, Grace?

645
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:46,243
This is what you want to talk about

646
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,244
when we're all dying?

647
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,379
I'm not dying! You are.

648
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,288
Oh, god...

649
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,266
Oh...

650
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:19,041
You've reached
Special Agent Grant MacLaren...

651
00:32:27,176 --> 00:32:28,608
Want to take a break?

652
00:32:32,732 --> 00:32:33,807
No, I'm good.

653
00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:35,715
Okay. Come on.

654
00:32:36,488 --> 00:32:38,018
Almost there.

655
00:33:01,742 --> 00:33:03,341
Guns on the ground!

656
00:33:12,587 --> 00:33:14,119
Secure the warhead.

657
00:33:19,112 --> 00:33:20,325
Where are you taking it?

658
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:23,328
Somewhere it can't power the Director.

659
00:33:23,363 --> 00:33:24,529
Oh, come on.

660
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,731
Of course we knew
you'd try something like this

661
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:28,567
when you didn't get the uranium.

662
00:33:28,602 --> 00:33:30,001
Don't beat yourself up!

663
00:33:30,036 --> 00:33:32,070
You're a good team, and we need numbers.

664
00:33:32,106 --> 00:33:33,871
We should be working together.

665
00:33:33,907 --> 00:33:35,406
I don't think so.

666
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:37,174
The Director had its chance.

667
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,078
Didn't change a goddamn thing
in the future!

668
00:33:40,113 --> 00:33:41,613
Other than create the Faction.

669
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,495
The future we came from,

670
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,282
you all died in
the collapse of shelter 41.

671
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:48,352
Why can't I wrap my head
around that shit?

672
00:33:48,387 --> 00:33:50,221
Why am I not surprised?

673
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:53,491
All right.

674
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:55,959
Thanks for the plutonium.

675
00:33:56,472 --> 00:33:58,195
We'll make sure to put it to good use.

676
00:33:58,231 --> 00:33:59,530
Let's go!

677
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:00,764
Plutonium?

678
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,767
What... You think we brought
a nuclear warhead in here?

679
00:34:03,802 --> 00:34:04,935
I thought you said

680
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,870
that they were watching
all of our communications.

681
00:34:06,905 --> 00:34:08,138
There was a typo

682
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,973
in my Admiral Donahue email that...

683
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:11,374
it may have thrown them off.

684
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:13,644
When I wrote "Mark 45
warhead" instead of, uh...

685
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,645
What was it? Mark 46?

686
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,080
- Oh! Oh, right.
- The 45 was nuclear.

687
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:18,548
That makes total sense.

688
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:21,118
Except the Mark 45 torpedo

689
00:34:21,153 --> 00:34:22,786
was decommissioned in 1976.

690
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:24,254
On a Wednesday.

691
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:26,148
Never in a million years

692
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:29,526
could we get a nuclear warhead
from a U.S. naval station.

693
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,156
Your friends just walked away

694
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:33,663
with a conventional Mark 46
antisubmarine warhead.

695
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,099
Totally different.

696
00:34:38,952 --> 00:34:41,592
Carly, I think they're
far enough away now.

697
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:19,307
Device is in place and activated.

698
00:35:32,388 --> 00:35:34,555
Turn around.

699
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:41,741
Come on, Mac.

700
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:43,831
I'm unarmed.

701
00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:46,234
You really think you can
kill me in cold blood?

702
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,401
I really do.

703
00:35:58,396 --> 00:36:02,132
_

704
00:36:06,588 --> 00:36:08,321
Aah!

705
00:36:33,912 --> 00:36:35,915
I'm Traveler 4991.

706
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,112
It worked.

707
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:40,363
The Director's

708
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,760
back up and running.

709
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,358
The cure has been sent to the 21st.

710
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:48,028
The encrypted beacon
on the device activated

711
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:50,806
Almost the moment power
to the Director was cut off.

712
00:36:50,831 --> 00:36:53,064
It took some time
for us to find and recover it,

713
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,333
but we got to it without them knowing...

714
00:36:55,368 --> 00:36:56,434
Even when we broke through,

715
00:36:56,469 --> 00:36:57,969
the energy source was only capable

716
00:36:58,005 --> 00:37:00,939
of powering the Director
for three seconds.

717
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:03,474
Enough time for the Director
to reroute the power to itself

718
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,575
through the network,

719
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:07,212
cut off the Faction's
access to the reactor,

720
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:09,480
design the cure...

721
00:37:10,112 --> 00:37:11,882
to win the war.

722
00:37:11,918 --> 00:37:13,351
How many Faction are still here?

723
00:37:13,386 --> 00:37:15,553
It's impossible to know
how many were sent

724
00:37:15,588 --> 00:37:16,921
into the quantum frame.

725
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:19,290
The Director won't have
a T.E.L.L. for all of them.

726
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:28,598
Kat?

727
00:37:28,634 --> 00:37:29,934
Grant.

728
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:31,435
I have been so worried.

729
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:32,636
I've been trying to call you.

730
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:33,938
I know, I'm sorry, but all the work

731
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:35,139
we've been doing, it's paid off.

732
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:36,673
You're gonna be okay.

733
00:37:36,709 --> 00:37:37,674
I'm so sick.

734
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,909
.Don't say that if it's not real

735
00:37:38,945 --> 00:37:40,477
No, I promise, we've had a breakthrough.

736
00:37:40,512 --> 00:37:41,478
Watch the news.

737
00:37:41,513 --> 00:37:43,613
I-I'll be... I'll be back with you

738
00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:44,881
as fast as I can.

739
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:46,216
I'm worried about the baby.

740
00:37:46,251 --> 00:37:48,785
I'll be back tomorrow at the latest.

741
00:37:51,523 --> 00:37:53,990
Maybe sooner.

742
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:05,668
He didn't answer.

743
00:38:20,751 --> 00:38:22,418
We did it.

744
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:24,420
That means we should be
able to wake you up soon.

745
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:26,355
One, she can't hear you.

746
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:27,390
Two, I can't believe

747
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:28,591
you're giving her the cure first.

748
00:38:28,626 --> 00:38:29,692
I'm standing right here!

749
00:38:29,727 --> 00:38:30,993
Boyd is far more sick.

750
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:32,861
Am I at least next?

751
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:34,797
No. The newly arrived Traveler

752
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:37,566
in her very sick host body, then you.

753
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:39,968
Oh, just admit you hate me.

754
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:52,013
Kat?

755
00:38:52,048 --> 00:38:54,048
Sweetheart, hey. Hey, wake up.

756
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,917
Ohh... you're home?

757
00:38:55,952 --> 00:38:57,859
And I've got something for you.

758
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:01,055
Come on.

759
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:02,424
What is it?

760
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:05,393
No, I can't take any medicine,
in case it affects the baby.

761
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:07,394
I got this directly from the CDC.

762
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,763
I made sure to ask.

763
00:39:08,798 --> 00:39:10,331
It's perfectly safe.

764
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:24,179
It works really fast.

765
00:39:28,284 --> 00:39:30,050
I'm going to let you sleep.

766
00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:31,585
No. Can you just lie with me

767
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,086
for a bit?

768
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:34,622
Just for a minute.

769
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:36,819
I would like nothing more.

770
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,099
Jeff?

771
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,099
Jeffrey? Jeffrey!

772
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,416
Carly?

773
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,455
I know you were trying to call.

774
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,123
I had to get this first.

775
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,192
It's the treatment for the virus.

776
00:40:13,227 --> 00:40:15,194
What? Where did you get it?

777
00:40:17,198 --> 00:40:18,164
It doesn't matter.

778
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,032
It'll cure you both.

779
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:22,134
I was so scared.

780
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,669
I didn't know what to do.

781
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:24,670
You didn't come home.

782
00:40:24,705 --> 00:40:26,972
I didn't know what to do but hold him.

783
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,207
Ohh...

784
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,179
Give him to me. I know.

785
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:35,547
I'm supposed to go to work

786
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:37,015
soon as you got home, but...

787
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,925
Okay. It's okay.

788
00:40:39,718 --> 00:40:41,787
Just rest a while first, okay?

789
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:43,188
I know. I know, I know.

790
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:44,389
Yeah, I think I will.

791
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,490
I know.

792
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:50,361
The cure was developed by scientists

793
00:40:50,396 --> 00:40:51,696
at the Center for Disease Control,

794
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:53,198
and is now being mass produced

795
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:55,133
and sent to health officials
all around the world.

796
00:40:55,168 --> 00:40:57,035
It's being estimated that...

797
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,036
Marce!

798
00:40:58,071 --> 00:40:59,470
...will be all but eradicated.

799
00:40:59,505 --> 00:41:00,671
Did you hear that they cured this thing?

800
00:41:00,707 --> 00:41:01,806
...death rate is expected
to drop significantly...

801
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:04,308
Ah, you're probably the one
that came up with it.

802
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:05,643
Not this time.

803
00:41:05,678 --> 00:41:07,578
Did you stay inside?

804
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:09,380
No.

805
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:11,382
No, I was helping out
at one of the shelters.

806
00:41:11,417 --> 00:41:13,751
David... you could have been exposed.

807
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:15,499
Yeah, I was.

808
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:18,834
The people I work with

809
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,103
are the first ones to be forgotten

810
00:41:20,138 --> 00:41:22,605
when something like this happens.

811
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,441
You're not gonna give me that, are you?

812
00:41:24,476 --> 00:41:26,112
Only if you're sick.

813
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:28,545
Speaking of sick...

814
00:41:28,872 --> 00:41:31,414
This man I know just collapsed

815
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,832
while I was trying to get him soup.

816
00:41:35,553 --> 00:41:36,786
Your pulse is good.

817
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:38,988
And while they were wheeling him out...

818
00:41:39,632 --> 00:41:42,032
I felt like one of those minor characters

819
00:41:42,526 --> 00:41:44,393
in a movie that does not end well.

820
00:41:44,992 --> 00:41:46,796
And I thought to myself,

821
00:41:47,432 --> 00:41:50,700
"Marcy's gonna give me shit
if I end up dying from this."

822
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:57,606
Because I can't help myself.

823
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:00,309
You mean from helping others?

824
00:42:00,344 --> 00:42:02,144
Yeah, but isn't that what you do too?

825
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:03,612
Open your mouth.

826
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,679
Your way of doing things...

827
00:42:04,715 --> 00:42:07,048
ith... ith more imprethive.

828
00:42:08,118 --> 00:42:09,317
Right. Well, you're not sick.

829
00:42:11,592 --> 00:42:13,488
Well, maybe you should
give me the shot anyway.

830
00:42:13,523 --> 00:42:15,156
No symptoms.

831
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:17,025
If you were exposed,
it means you're immune,

832
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,694
so find your friend who collapsed,

833
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,295
and give this to him.

834
00:42:21,954 --> 00:42:22,931
Okay?

835
00:42:22,966 --> 00:42:24,312
Yeah.

836
00:42:25,628 --> 00:42:27,235
What, you're leaving again?

837
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:28,836
I have other patients.

838
00:42:28,871 --> 00:42:30,223
I just... I wanted to make sure

839
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:31,490
that you were okay.

840
00:42:31,526 --> 00:42:32,840
Wow.

841
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:33,874
House call.

842
00:42:33,909 --> 00:42:36,544
I'll be back later, if that's all right.

843
00:42:37,152 --> 00:42:38,646
Don't wait up.

844
00:42:43,712 --> 00:42:45,953
Yeah, I probably will.

845
00:42:50,512 --> 00:42:52,225
I thought you were going home.

846
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:54,494
Just back to check on my patients.

847
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,031
How are you guys feeling?

848
00:42:57,066 --> 00:42:58,698
Oh...

849
00:42:58,733 --> 00:43:00,367
Much better, thank you.

850
00:43:00,402 --> 00:43:01,434
Good.

851
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:02,469
You'll be happy to know that

852
00:43:02,504 --> 00:43:04,604
the CDC has set up treatment centers

853
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,040
to disseminate the antiviral en masse.

854
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:08,408
And Jenny...

855
00:43:08,872 --> 00:43:11,578
that is, Jenny 3.0...

856
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,232
is coordinating deliveries.

857
00:43:15,216 --> 00:43:16,382
Marcy?

858
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:17,383
Oh, yeah.

859
00:43:17,418 --> 00:43:19,485
She woke up a while ago.

860
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,056
Hey.

861
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:24,423
Hey.

862
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:25,925
How're you feeling?

863
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,326
Mm. Like shit.

864
00:43:27,361 --> 00:43:28,527
But I'll live.

865
00:43:28,563 --> 00:43:30,596
I'll also live, thanks for asking.

866
00:43:31,632 --> 00:43:32,598
I still haven't heard

867
00:43:32,633 --> 00:43:34,233
from the other two members of my team,

868
00:43:34,268 --> 00:43:35,734
but I'm hoping...

869
00:43:56,555 --> 00:44:04,422
