00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,219
Previously, on Travelers...

2
00:00:01,255 --> 00:00:04,753
She uploaded a command while
pretending to save Marcy's life.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,570
You mean you used me.

4
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:08,305
I have filed a recommendation

5
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,974
for his father to take custody.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,442
Jacqueline, please!

7
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:12,776
It's not safe.

8
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:15,246
Pack a bag, go to your mother's
for a few days, maybe a week.

9
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:16,280
Okay, here I am.

10
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:17,481
What's so important?

11
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,288
I'm Traveler 4112.

12
00:00:24,309 --> 00:00:26,275
The Quantum Frame, it's being scrapped.

13
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,876
I'm gonna need your help
with a lot of things.

14
00:00:27,912 --> 00:00:29,344
Welcome to the 21st.

15
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:15,990
I am so sorry.

16
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:18,959
"How could he be offering
a Whistler chalet,

17
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,328
"a Tuscan villa,
and a Caribbean hideaway,

18
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:23,897
all for $20,000?"

19
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:27,801
I've gotta be honest...
I'm wondering the same thing.

20
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:28,969
Look, I've been doing this a while,

21
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,105
and I have never seen a deal like this!

22
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:34,174
So which property
appeals to you the most?

23
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,442
Maybe the Caribbean hideaway?

24
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,612
Don't we all
wish we were there right now?

25
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:40,847
But seven to ten days a year?

26
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,749
That's, like, $2,000 a day.

27
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:45,485
Yeah!
If you go once!

28
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:47,320
It's a lifestyle.

29
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:50,056
Isn't that what
you were interested in, Dale?

30
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,957
Yeah... I said that.

31
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:53,292
But that was after you said

32
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:54,660
this would only take 90 minutes

33
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:56,829
and we'd get a free dinner
at House of Rib.

34
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,697
90 minutes...

35
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:01,063
No, I hear you.

36
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:07,740
All right...

37
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,207
I don't know how I'm gonna do it,

38
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:10,709
but let me go talk to my manager,

39
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,611
and see if we can do better.

40
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:14,079
Give me five.

41
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:16,515
When I come back,

42
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:19,084
you'll have a whole new perspective.

Kat!

45
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:22,913
I thought you said the danger was over.

46
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:24,114
It is.

47
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:25,582
Then why are you holding a gun?

48
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:28,004
You didn't call me back.

49
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,178
I thought you were still
at your mother's.

50
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:31,087
Why didn't you say something
when you came in the house?

51
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:32,555
I expected you to be at work!

52
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:34,524
I've been up all night.

53
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:35,592
I'm sorry if...

54
00:03:35,627 --> 00:03:36,959
Doesn't matter,
I'm just glad you're home.

55
00:03:36,995 --> 00:03:38,628
I'm not home. I'm just here

56
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:39,962
to get a few things.

57
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:43,099
I know the last couple of days
have been insane.

58
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:45,668
You know, I must have
left a dozen messages.

59
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,300
Until I got yours

60
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:49,105
at 4:00 this morning,

61
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,906
I thought for sure you were dead.

62
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,675
That's all over now.

63
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,709
What's over?

64
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:55,199
Tell me.

65
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,779
You know I can't talk about my work.

66
00:03:56,814 --> 00:03:59,048
You've never said my life was in danger!

67
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:06,087
Because of my work,
I was targeted by a... a group.

68
00:04:06,123 --> 00:04:07,456
And I was afraid, by association,

69
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:08,790
you might be in danger, too.

70
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:10,192
It's not the case,
they're no longer a threat.

71
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:12,494
That's all I can say.

72
00:04:13,697 --> 00:04:15,479
How do I even know that's true?

73
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,799
You're obviously capable of lying to me.

74
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,334
Please stay and talk.
I'll make breakfast.

75
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,202
No, I'm not gonna do that.

76
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,451
Kat! Hey.

77
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:25,843
What? Are you planning on supervising?

78
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,209
What do you want from me?

79
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:30,478
I don't want anything from you, Grant.

80
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:32,380
Not a single thing.

81
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:48,162
David?

82
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:49,963
Hey!

83
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,399
I made pancakes.

84
00:04:51,434 --> 00:04:52,667
You probably don't remember

85
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:53,734
what pancakes are,

86
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,403
but I happen to know
that you like them a lot.

87
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:58,672
What's wrong?

88
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,841
Uh, nothing, just, uh...

89
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:03,543
You used to sleep naked when we met,

90
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,445
and I thought maybe you...

91
00:05:06,882 --> 00:05:07,881
Nope.

92
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,982
False alarm.

93
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,388
How long you been up?

94
00:05:15,424 --> 00:05:17,056
Oh, since, uh...

95
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,759
All night.

96
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:22,295
I was thinking of maybe
watching some TV,

97
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:25,465
but then you were all wrapped up cozy

98
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,166
on the... on the couch,

99
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,435
and I didn't want to wake you, so, um...

100
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,303
then I, uh...

101
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:32,371
then I...

102
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:33,873
Hey, you know what?

103
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:36,209
Let's switch things up
and-and you sit here,

104
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:38,410
'cause I'm always sitting on this side.

105
00:05:38,446 --> 00:05:40,913
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

106
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,014
Thanks.

107
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:45,882
Good.

108
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,552
Are you okay?

109
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:52,558
Hmm?

110
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:53,795
Sure!

111
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:56,715
I don't know.

112
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,730
No.

113
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,699
I mean, a strange man died

114
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,702
right across from where
I eat my cereal every morning,

115
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,072
and I'm just having a hard time dealing.

116
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:08,073
David, he was gonna kill you.

117
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,440
That doesn't help.

118
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:10,876
I was the one that he was looking for.

119
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:12,944
Well, that definitely doesn't...

120
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,345
David, it's over.

121
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:16,381
You're safe.

122
00:06:19,286 --> 00:06:21,218
Well, you know that...

123
00:06:21,254 --> 00:06:23,742
does make me feel a little bit better.

124
00:06:25,392 --> 00:06:27,392
I thought your parents
were never gonna leave.

125
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:29,225
They're just worried about me.

126
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:31,429
Yeah, but the doctor said

127
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:33,030
it's just temporary, right?

128
00:06:33,065 --> 00:06:34,665
From the swelling?

129
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,000
Does it hurt?

130
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:37,434
No.

131
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:38,969
You really can't feel anything?

132
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:40,104
Uh-uh.

133
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:42,606
Nothing?

134
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:44,708
No.

135
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:48,478
What about this?

136
00:06:48,514 --> 00:06:49,813
Whoa.

137
00:06:49,848 --> 00:06:51,281
Rene...

138
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:53,517
The nurse could walk back in any minute.

139
00:06:53,552 --> 00:06:54,751
You can feel that?

140
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:56,085
Rene...

141
00:06:56,121 --> 00:06:58,188
Please... Please.

142
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:02,152
I'm still in recovery. I should rest.

143
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,660
I shouldn't get too excited.

144
00:07:05,697 --> 00:07:07,827
Okay... babe. You rest.

145
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:10,934
I'll see you tomorrow...

146
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:13,303
and the next day...

147
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:14,938
and the next.

148
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:22,010
Do I seriously have to listen to that

149
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:23,011
tomorrow

150
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:24,814
and the next day and the next?

151
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:28,317
I almost pressed the call button

152
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:30,986
because I thought I was
gonna throw up my lunch.

153
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:32,688
She's very young.

154
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,323
You're very old.

155
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,958
I can't argue with that.

156
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:37,693
You really don't feel anything yet?

157
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:39,361
I mean, the amount of medical nanites

158
00:07:39,396 --> 00:07:40,362
I gave you

159
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:41,429
was barely above the minimum threshold,

160
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:43,999
but I thought you'd have
some sensation by now.

161
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:45,907
With age comes patience.

162
00:07:47,004 --> 00:07:48,370
How are you feeling?

163
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:49,872
Like I could walk out of here,

164
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,340
but I'll have to fake it for a while,

165
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,408
or they'll think I'm a medical miracle.

166
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:54,642
Mm!

167
00:07:54,678 --> 00:07:56,210
Besides, I love the food in here.

168
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:58,613
It's amazing! Right?

169
00:08:08,165 --> 00:08:09,389
Carly...

170
00:08:10,394 --> 00:08:11,825
Carly!

171
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:13,027
What do you want?

172
00:08:13,062 --> 00:08:14,996
How about you answer your phone?

173
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,065
I'm not here to creep,

174
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:19,000
just to say thanks.

175
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:20,067
You can thank your Sergeant.

176
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:21,202
He's the one that made me
give the statement.

177
00:08:21,237 --> 00:08:22,370
Oh, I did.

178
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:25,006
Listen, I'm just as upset
about Jeffrey Jr. as you.

179
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:29,342
I'm not even allowed to see him, Jeff!

180
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:30,511
No contact.

181
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:32,012
Me neither.

182
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,949
You didn't know?

183
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,499
Hey, partner.

184
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:48,861
Everything all right?

185
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:51,364
I just went into
the wrong bathroom.

186
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,466
Back to basic training for you.

187
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:55,035
What's this?

188
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,736
Missing persons report.

189
00:08:56,771 --> 00:08:59,205
Doesn't missing persons fall
under local law enforcement?

190
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:01,029
We come in if there's
an interstate component.

191
00:09:01,064 --> 00:09:02,106
Right.

192
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:04,109
All six failed to check
out of the same hotel.

193
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,645
Left all their belongings.

194
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,004
"Serenity Inn and Suites."

195
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:10,650
So... So I guess we have to go there.

196
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,217
Yeah.

197
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:13,886
We're FBI agents.

198
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:15,788
Badges and everything.

199
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:17,756
All right, but, uh...

200
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,491
can you drive?

201
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:21,767
You just need practice.

202
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,097
Who'd like to start?

203
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,304
Hi. My name is Philip...
and I'm an addict.

204
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,905
Hi, Philip.

205
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:36,608
You know, the hardest part about this

206
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:39,611
is admitting to yourself
that you're not strong enough.

207
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,246
Uh, that you can't just stop...

208
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:44,850
even when you know
what it's doing to you.

209
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,652
I was doing really well, I was...

210
00:09:47,688 --> 00:09:50,688
and then I lost somebody close to me.

211
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,258
Technically, not, uh, "lost" lost,

212
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,761
she's still in my life,
but she's just...

213
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,466
This is impossible to explain.

214
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,135
I feel like she's gone.

215
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:07,104
At least, a part of her is.

216
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,341
Anyway...

217
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,010
I miss her.

218
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,045
Thank you, Philip.

219
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,883
Who'd like to go next?

220
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:32,429
Hi.

221
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,299
I'm sorry about your friend.

222
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,469
Thanks.

223
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,405
We need all the support
we can get, right?

224
00:10:48,146 --> 00:10:50,312
I'm Traveler 4514.

225
00:10:52,677 --> 00:10:55,251
The Director assigned me to help you.

226
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,558
You're right.

227
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:04,860
A little fresh air is nice.

228
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:07,696
It's important not to get fixated.

229
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,819
Was I fixated?

230
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,401
Yeah, I was.

231
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:14,069
It's normal to be rattled by trauma.

232
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:15,270
You just want to make sure

233
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:17,072
it doesn't tip into
something more serious.

234
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:18,840
Like what?

235
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:21,142
Here, let's sit.

236
00:11:23,547 --> 00:11:25,480
Jesus.

237
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,349
I think you're experiencing

238
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:30,552
early symptoms of PTSD.

239
00:11:31,621 --> 00:11:33,054
That's ridiculous.

240
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,557
Soldiers in battle get PTSD.

241
00:11:35,592 --> 00:11:36,791
First responders
of horrible disasters...

242
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:37,725
Heightened anxiety,

243
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
inability to sleep,

244
00:11:40,183 --> 00:11:42,097
exaggerated startle response.

245
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:45,600
Exaggerated star...
You just made that one up!

246
00:11:45,635 --> 00:11:47,167
I'm fine!

247
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,872
I mean, technically,
it's too early to diagnose,

248
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:54,541
but early treatment won't hurt
and it should help, so...

249
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:56,176
Here. Come here.

250
00:11:58,743 --> 00:12:00,662
Give me your hands.

251
00:12:01,317 --> 00:12:03,456
I want you to close your eyes.

252
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:06,086
I want you to think about
what happened to you

253
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:09,437
while you focus on my tapping... okay?

254
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:13,627
Seriously? Is this a real thing?

255
00:12:13,662 --> 00:12:16,386
'Cause it-it feels a little bullshitty.

256
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,171
Uh, you know what? I'm sorry. I, uh...

257
00:12:27,308 --> 00:12:28,908
Could we just keep walking?

258
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:32,679
Yeah. Good idea.

259
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:35,948
You know what?

260
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:37,316
I'm gonna head back to the apartment.

261
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:39,218
I'll meet you back there.

262
00:12:39,254 --> 00:12:40,686
Where are you going?

263
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:42,821
To get something that'll help.

264
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:47,059
Okay.

265
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:57,402
So your mission is to help me?

266
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:01,674
Specifically to... give you this.

267
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:04,242
Eye drops?

268
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,644
Synthetic compound.

269
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,813
To help with the heroin addiction.

270
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:10,649
It's invented 20 years or so from now.

271
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:14,085
Naloxone, buprenorphine...

272
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,321
and some other things

273
00:13:16,356 --> 00:13:18,156
that are even harder to pronounce.

274
00:13:18,192 --> 00:13:20,925
But... it will stop the craving

275
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,294
and curb your withdrawal.

276
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:23,995
And I'm just getting this now?

277
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,748
Hey, I-I know you were trying hard,

278
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:28,766
but then you had the setback

279
00:13:28,802 --> 00:13:30,168
when you got captured, they gave you...

280
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:31,669
How'd you know about that?

281
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:34,906
The future.

282
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,775
Maybe the Director figured
you'd quit on your own

283
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:40,144
and you couldn't do it.

284
00:13:51,857 --> 00:13:53,691
There. See?

285
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:54,692
It's perfectly...

286
00:14:05,037 --> 00:14:06,536
That wasn't funny.

287
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:08,038
Yes, it was.

288
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:14,244
One drop per eye, as needed.

289
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:19,649
Jenny, by the way.

290
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,533
These are amazing.

291
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:39,835
Yep.

292
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,070
Now what do I do?

293
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:42,838
Whatever you want.

294
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:47,009
What are you gonna do?

295
00:14:48,382 --> 00:14:51,182
Did you receive any training
on a simulator?

296
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:53,303
You had a simulator?

297
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:54,971
Wow. Okay.

298
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,007
Uh, just loosen up on the wheel,

299
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,574
and try to get out of your head.

300
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,777
You know, sing a song or something.

301
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:03,498
Doesn't have to be a song.

302
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,748
Just recite something you know by heart.

303
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:07,317
Uh, list the protocols.

304
00:15:07,352 --> 00:15:10,353
Uh, Protocol 1. Uh...

305
00:15:10,388 --> 00:15:12,054
Mission comes first.

306
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,023
Uh, two, leave the future in the past.

307
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:15,178
Now, let's turn up here.

308
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,746
Protocol 3...

309
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,361
don't take a life, don't save a life,

310
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:20,042
- unless otherwise directed.
- Good.

311
00:15:20,077 --> 00:15:22,598
Protocol 4, uh, don't reproduce.

312
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:23,766
Don't reproduce.

313
00:15:36,047 --> 00:15:38,613
I don't know how the hell
you got to work today.

314
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,882
Uh, just like that.

315
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:42,050
Yeah, well, Protocol 2

316
00:15:42,085 --> 00:15:44,018
isn't gonna get you out of practicing.

317
00:15:44,054 --> 00:15:45,119
Hold on a sec.

318
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:46,187
Kat?

319
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:47,652
You're right. We should talk.

320
00:15:47,687 --> 00:15:49,358
Great. Uh...

321
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:50,946
Come by the house tonight. I'll make...

322
00:15:50,971 --> 00:15:52,715
I'm staying at Nicole's
while she's away.

323
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,429
I'll text you the address.

324
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,798
Sure. Want me to bring anyth...?

325
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:05,840
Carly, they took away our son.

326
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,308
We need to be on the same side.

327
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:08,809
You charged me with assault,

328
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:10,939
blocked me from getting a job,

329
00:16:10,974 --> 00:16:12,947
told the judge I was an unfit mother.

330
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:14,782
You have every right to be pissed at me,

331
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:17,050
but I did those things
because I was pissed at you.

332
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,854
So how about we stop being
pissed at each other,

333
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:21,506
and see what happens?

334
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,939
When I saw the girl about to shoot you,

335
00:16:26,344 --> 00:16:28,462
I just felt...

336
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,602
I can't imagine what I'd do
if I lost you for good.

337
00:16:36,264 --> 00:16:38,431
Yeah, I guess I never did
thank you for that.

338
00:16:38,807 --> 00:16:40,507
Mm, well, you still haven't.

339
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:41,817
Thank you.

340
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,071
You're welcome.

341
00:16:55,356 --> 00:16:57,500
So walk us through what happened.

342
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,192
The seminar was going great.

343
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:01,759
I had two buyers on the hook.

344
00:17:01,794 --> 00:17:03,047
Maybe three!

345
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:04,180
And then I...

346
00:17:04,507 --> 00:17:05,949
I left the room near the end,

347
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:06,983
to go get my manager.

348
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:08,317
We usually offer a slightly better deal

349
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,419
to really drive it home.

350
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:11,353
Sure.

351
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,522
Except when I came back,
20 minutes later,

352
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:14,924
they were gone.

353
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,793
20 minutes?

354
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,661
It's a sales technique...

355
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:20,996
just let 'em stew on it a little bit.

356
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:23,599
Guess it wasn't such a great deal.

357
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:26,612
Can you show us the security footage?

358
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,443
Marce?

359
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:36,878
Hey. My key isn't working.

360
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:44,720
Hi.

361
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,287
Hey.

362
00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:48,767
I stopped by the hardware store
on the way home,

363
00:17:48,802 --> 00:17:51,860
and it turns out
they were having a big...

364
00:17:53,062 --> 00:17:54,795
...sale on locks.

365
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:56,998
Yay, "safety."

366
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:01,068
Why don't you have a seat?

367
00:18:05,175 --> 00:18:07,542
Now, we only use this
for training purposes.

368
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:08,843
We don't care.

369
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:09,910
Right.

370
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:11,512
Can I have one of these?

371
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:14,181
Sure, yeah, but they're a day old.

372
00:18:15,786 --> 00:18:17,885
Press play, please.

373
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:41,441
You didn't tamper with this, did you?

374
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:42,942
No. No, I swear.

375
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:44,443
You can stop swearing.

376
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,079
Did you have more plans for the group?

377
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:48,214
We were gonna shuttle them
to our sister location

378
00:18:48,249 --> 00:18:49,883
to pick up their free dinner vouchers.

379
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:51,117
In the shuttle bus outside?

380
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,351
Yeah. Yeah, why?

381
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:54,120
Might want to get your brakes checked.

382
00:19:00,461 --> 00:19:01,908
What is this?

383
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:04,129
This is an eye-movement therapy kit

384
00:19:04,165 --> 00:19:05,836
to treat PTSD.

385
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:09,402
All right.

386
00:19:09,437 --> 00:19:12,009
Follow the light with your eyes.

387
00:19:12,773 --> 00:19:14,807
I want you to think
about what you were doing

388
00:19:14,842 --> 00:19:16,889
moments before the man arrived.

389
00:19:18,913 --> 00:19:20,846
I was washing dishes.

390
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:23,248
Concentrate on how you felt.

391
00:19:25,452 --> 00:19:26,685
What happened next?

392
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:30,089
Drying the dishes.

393
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:40,599
I-I don't see how this is supp...

394
00:19:40,634 --> 00:19:42,967
This is part of
the desensitization process.

395
00:19:43,457 --> 00:19:45,292
Give me your hands.

396
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,505
Close your eyes.

397
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,742
All right.

398
00:20:05,224 --> 00:20:06,624
He forced his way in.

399
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:07,824
How did you feel when that happened?

400
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:21,371
He kept hitting me.

401
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:26,476
David...
David... David!

402
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:29,079
No!

403
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:31,547
David.

404
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:32,816
I'm right here.

405
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:34,450
Hey. Look at me. Hey!

406
00:20:34,486 --> 00:20:36,286
You're fine. I am right here.

407
00:20:36,321 --> 00:20:37,887
Okay?

408
00:20:37,922 --> 00:20:40,089
You're fine. You're fine.

409
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:43,886
Why do you think
that they put a hole in on.

410
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:47,168
Let's concentrate on
one mystery at a time,

411
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:48,901
- shall we?
- Um.

412
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:52,641
New arrivals cause
static on video cameras,

413
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,775
so it's pretty obvious
that it's six new Travelers.

414
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,110
With a total disregard for Protocol 5.

415
00:20:58,146 --> 00:20:59,679
Maybe they're working on mission.

416
00:21:00,075 --> 00:21:01,614
Let's be sure. In the meantime,

417
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,349
we bury any connection to this hotel.

418
00:21:03,384 --> 00:21:04,851
Philip, are you there?

419
00:21:04,886 --> 00:21:05,985
Yeah, go ahead.

420
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:08,454
I'm leaving what looks
like the scene of a mass arrival...

421
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:09,923
six people in a hotel conference room.

422
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,157
Do you remember anything about

423
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,216
a group of travelers
arriving today in Bellingham?

424
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:14,626
Uh, how were they supposed to die?

425
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:16,462
I'm just guessing, but something

426
00:21:16,497 --> 00:21:17,530
with a shuttle bus.

427
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:18,597
Brake failure, maybe?

428
00:21:18,632 --> 00:21:19,665
Nothing like that today,

429
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,267
but you know the timeline's
been changing.

430
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:23,001
Yeah. Or maybe they went missing

431
00:21:23,037 --> 00:21:24,437
for a different reason.

432
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:27,873
What, you mean like how we went missing?

433
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:29,307
Let's hope not.

434
00:21:29,342 --> 00:21:31,109
I'll keep on it.

435
00:21:31,732 --> 00:21:33,178
Sorry about that.

436
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:35,313
Oh, must be a relief.

437
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:36,548
What?

438
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:38,684
If you're seeing changes
in the timeline,

439
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,819
it'll mean you won't have
to carry the burden

440
00:21:40,854 --> 00:21:42,921
of knowing everyone who's about to die.

441
00:21:42,957 --> 00:21:44,655
Maybe eventually.

442
00:21:45,246 --> 00:21:46,657
It's amazing how little has changed

443
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:48,499
considering everything we've done.

444
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:52,962
I know what happened
with Aleksander Andreiko.

445
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,900
Maybe we shouldn't
be talking about that.

446
00:21:55,935 --> 00:21:57,569
Hey, I agree with what you did.

447
00:21:57,604 --> 00:21:59,337
You saved that kid's life.

448
00:21:59,843 --> 00:22:01,639
You know the Director isn't perfect.

449
00:22:02,346 --> 00:22:04,041
We definitely shouldn't
be talking about that.

450
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:06,210
Don't forget. We created it.

451
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:09,239
The Director might not
be able to break rules,

452
00:22:09,264 --> 00:22:11,548
but we can.

453
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,234
What?

454
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,055
I feel like I'm waiting
to be struck by lightning.

455
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:22,659
Not a black cloud in the sky.

456
00:22:34,378 --> 00:22:36,088
Come on.

457
00:22:37,074 --> 00:22:38,966
Where are we going?

458
00:22:40,411 --> 00:22:42,512
It's a surprise.

459
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,718
Is that any better?

460
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,754
I have no idea.

461
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:55,290
I have another, different treatment.

462
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:58,794
Can it be later?

463
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:00,495
Sure.

464
00:23:07,286 --> 00:23:08,270
Although, sometimes,

465
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:09,937
medicine is the best medicine.

466
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:12,974
Cannabis is known to help
with symptoms of...

467
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:14,192
Absolutely, it's known to.

468
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,996
You need to inhale the smoke.

469
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:20,682
Oh, I'm familiar with the process.

470
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:34,897
You know, it's excellent
for memory loss, too.

471
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:52,179
Hey.

472
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:54,915
Hi.

473
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,377
Come in.

474
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:00,320
Wow. This is nice.

475
00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:03,289
You've been here before.

476
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,219
We helped her move in.

477
00:24:05,728 --> 00:24:06,993
Right. Right.

478
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,329
All I remember is boxes.

479
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,133
What are you doing?

480
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:18,404
Opening some wine.

481
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,646
So, how long's Nicole away?

482
00:24:26,681 --> 00:24:30,015
All year. She's on sabbatical.

483
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,322
What's that?

484
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:39,795
Separation papers.

485
00:24:40,661 --> 00:24:41,994
They have to be filed...

486
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:43,528
Wait, wait, wait. You...

487
00:24:44,174 --> 00:24:45,231
You're talking divorce?

488
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:47,199
You broke your vows, Grant.

489
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:48,367
And I told you,

490
00:24:48,402 --> 00:24:49,888
it's the worst mistake I ever m...

491
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:51,670
Shit.

492
00:24:51,705 --> 00:24:53,338
No, don't touch it.

493
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:54,685
I'm sorry.

494
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,548
You're bleeding.

495
00:25:00,347 --> 00:25:01,880
Yeah.

496
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:03,515
I'll get it.

497
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,749
Do you have any...?

498
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:06,613
Yeah, yeah. In the bathroom.

499
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,620
Everything all right?

500
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:47,390
I got to go.

501
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:50,627
No, not before
you sign these, Grant. I...

502
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:57,900
Thank you.

503
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:00,203
Are you okay?

504
00:26:07,178 --> 00:26:09,078
Trevor? Are you asleep?

505
00:26:10,315 --> 00:26:12,949
Uh... I was.

506
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:15,417
I was dreaming.

507
00:26:15,453 --> 00:26:17,142
About what?

508
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,456
I was walking in the park.

509
00:26:21,355 --> 00:26:23,425
I don't dream much.

510
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:25,427
I can tell.

511
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:28,111
Sorry. I shouldn't have woken you.

512
00:26:29,032 --> 00:26:29,998
I'm just used to being able

513
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:31,132
to have intelligent conversations

514
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:32,468
24/7.

515
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,404
I thought you weren't
much of a people person.

516
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:36,572
Who said that?

517
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:38,507
Ellis.

518
00:26:38,956 --> 00:26:40,609
Oh.

519
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:43,245
He was right, actually,

520
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,013
but I was talking about the Director.

521
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:48,016
Lamenting those conversations
are over now.

522
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,685
I talked to the Director a few times.

523
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,087
I talked to it endlessly.

524
00:26:54,657 --> 00:26:56,657
I don't know what to do with myself.

525
00:26:56,693 --> 00:26:59,163
Protocol 5. You can counsel children.

526
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:01,645
Please, I said intelligent conversation.

527
00:27:02,729 --> 00:27:04,231
So you miss the Director?

528
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:06,967
Huh.

529
00:27:07,003 --> 00:27:09,336
I think I do.

530
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:11,639
Interesting.

531
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,200
You miss her, don't you?

532
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:19,280
I can tell by the way you look at me.

533
00:27:19,315 --> 00:27:21,415
What you see is my realization

534
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,050
that, instead of saving Grace's life,

535
00:27:23,085 --> 00:27:25,619
I made her last few hours terrifying.

536
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,155
I guess I've cheated death for so long,

537
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,323
I thought that I could do the same

538
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:30,716
for somebody else.

539
00:27:31,227 --> 00:27:32,793
But I've lived long
enough to know better.

540
00:27:32,828 --> 00:27:34,327
Well, try to understand

541
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:36,696
that the faction had already
corrupted the Director.

542
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:38,197
The grand plan was in jeopardy.

543
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,299
I understand.

544
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:54,213
Ladies and gentlemen...

545
00:27:54,249 --> 00:27:57,083
please give a warm welcome
to our speaker for this evening,

546
00:27:57,118 --> 00:27:58,751
Dr. Edwin Calloway!

547
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:05,658
You can't be serious.

548
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:08,627
Edwin Calloway?

549
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:09,829
Do you know how much hatred

550
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:11,430
and intolerance this guy inspires?

551
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:12,731
Immigration...

552
00:28:12,767 --> 00:28:15,768
is the true test of a nation,

553
00:28:15,803 --> 00:28:19,472
because the nation needs to be
strong enough to survive it.

554
00:28:19,507 --> 00:28:22,107
Too much accommodation...

555
00:28:22,142 --> 00:28:23,942
This guy is a racist dick.

556
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:25,077
I am not watching this.

557
00:28:25,112 --> 00:28:26,445
Shh. Just wait.

558
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,280
How many people here today feel like

559
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,548
this country is headed
in the right direction?

560
00:28:31,718 --> 00:28:32,917
And how many feel like

561
00:28:32,953 --> 00:28:36,621
their cultures and traditions
are being respected

562
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:39,223
by the people they suddenly find

563
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:42,494
taking their jobs,
dating their daughters?

564
00:28:44,063 --> 00:28:47,064
Well, there's a reason
you all feel this way...

565
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:51,636
Their cultures
don't respect your culture.

566
00:28:55,741 --> 00:28:57,408
That's a mistake.

567
00:28:58,511 --> 00:29:00,144
All right. Shut it off.

568
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,212
Shut it off!

569
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:03,947
Shut it off!

570
00:29:10,312 --> 00:29:11,429
You did that?

571
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:13,223
Still not struck by lightning.

572
00:29:23,502 --> 00:29:24,635
Here.

573
00:29:25,608 --> 00:29:26,925
No, thanks. I feel fine.

574
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:29,572
Yeah, but do you want to feel amazing?

575
00:30:12,075 --> 00:30:14,608
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

576
00:30:18,314 --> 00:30:20,051
Protocol 4, right?

577
00:30:28,791 --> 00:30:31,859
What was I saying?

578
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,680
Uh...

579
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,881
that you should sell the apartment?

580
00:30:36,917 --> 00:30:38,383
Right.

581
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,986
Although, I think you got
to say if someone died,

582
00:30:42,022 --> 00:30:44,053
you know, on the disclosure form.

583
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:45,456
Just...

584
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:47,725
Re-stain the floors
and nobody needs to know.

585
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,427
See?

586
00:30:49,462 --> 00:30:52,292
That's why you're an FBI doctor.

587
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:58,069
Who am I kidding?

588
00:30:58,673 --> 00:31:00,801
I can't sell this place.

589
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:03,641
All my stuff's here.

590
00:31:05,244 --> 00:31:06,210
Oh, man.

591
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:08,141
I'm really feeling this.

592
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:13,317
I don't feel anything.

593
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:22,492
Hey, Mac?

594
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:23,426
Whatever it is,

595
00:31:23,462 --> 00:31:25,929
try figuring it out on your own.

596
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:28,245
I just did. Come on, check this out.

597
00:31:31,971 --> 00:31:34,937
Two of our missing people were
just flagged in Sacramento.

598
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:36,973
Local PD got 'em
for running a red light.

599
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:38,107
"Dale Miller"

600
00:31:38,142 --> 00:31:39,776
and "Meredith Gilroy."

601
00:31:39,811 --> 00:31:41,944
Looks like they don't
know how to drive either.

602
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,279
I suggested that these two

603
00:31:43,314 --> 00:31:45,348
were just having an affair.

604
00:31:45,384 --> 00:31:46,683
What about the others?

605
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:47,784
Technically?

606
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,352
No longer under our jurisdiction.

607
00:31:49,388 --> 00:31:51,643
Local PD took it back.

608
00:31:52,561 --> 00:31:54,390
There's hope for you yet.

609
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,358
Hey.

610
00:32:03,394 --> 00:32:04,533
Hey.

611
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:06,802
What is this?

612
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:08,837
I got a present for you.

613
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,721
Wow.

614
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:12,474
Looks great.

615
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,722
It, uh, it even covers up the...

616
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:17,379
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

617
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,715
I got you a present, too.

618
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,283
Yay, safety.

619
00:32:21,318 --> 00:32:23,786
I'm not gonna be needing those.

620
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:25,887
I'm not staying.

621
00:32:25,923 --> 00:32:27,122
What?

622
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:28,890
You can continue
the therapy on your own,

623
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:30,158
as you feel you need it.

624
00:32:30,193 --> 00:32:32,727
But I can already tell
that you're getting better.

625
00:32:32,762 --> 00:32:35,196
W-When did you decide this?

626
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:38,533
I was told my living here
was always temporary.

627
00:32:38,568 --> 00:32:41,035
You can't just buy me
a goodbye rug and then...

628
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,070
David...

629
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:44,171
you went through a traumatic experience.

630
00:32:44,206 --> 00:32:45,940
Yeah, I'm feeling another one coming on.

631
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:47,445
Well, just keep up
with the treatments...

632
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:49,243
Don't talk to me like I'm a patient.

633
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:51,646
I'm responsible for what happened.

634
00:32:53,883 --> 00:32:55,249
You said we were safe.

635
00:32:55,284 --> 00:32:56,751
You are, but...

636
00:32:56,786 --> 00:32:58,218
you'll be safer without me.

637
00:32:58,254 --> 00:32:59,987
How is that even possible?

638
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:01,021
You're the one who saved me.

639
00:33:01,057 --> 00:33:02,356
And look at the result.

640
00:33:02,391 --> 00:33:05,926
I mean, your anxiety
may never completely go away.

641
00:33:06,468 --> 00:33:08,295
I did that to you.

642
00:33:14,684 --> 00:33:17,979
You asked before
if we were intimate, and...

643
00:33:18,907 --> 00:33:21,858
I didn't know what to say
because, I mean...

644
00:33:22,678 --> 00:33:24,344
Well, I don't know,
because I'm an idiot.

645
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:26,696
What I should have said was, yes.

646
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:29,483
We were intimate.

647
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:32,986
I love you, Marcy.

648
00:33:33,955 --> 00:33:36,856
And you love me.
You just don't remember.

649
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,210
You're right.

650
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:43,863
I don't.

651
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,966
But I do care about you.

652
00:33:51,305 --> 00:33:54,039
Enough to leave.

653
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:07,785
I understand
this is a difficult time

654
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:09,321
for both of you.

655
00:34:09,356 --> 00:34:11,823
But the 72-hour
dependency action was filed

656
00:34:11,858 --> 00:34:14,426
and Jeffrey Jr. will be
in the care of the state

657
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:15,994
until the next assessment.

658
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,896
That's why we're here.

659
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,227
We need to see him.

660
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:20,698
Not until the next hearing.

661
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:21,966
I'm sorry.

662
00:34:22,335 --> 00:34:24,335
Trust that he's in a good home.

663
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,570
I'm his father!

664
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,905
I have a right to see my son.

665
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,801
The action was filed
for Jeffrey's safety.

666
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:30,041
By who?

667
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:33,344
It was you, wasn't it?

668
00:34:33,379 --> 00:34:36,847
When we received information
regarding the police incident...

669
00:34:36,882 --> 00:34:37,848
Okay. Hold on.

670
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:39,417
I was cleared of all charges...

671
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,984
I called you, Mr. Conniker,

672
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,853
and we spoke at length,

673
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:46,257
but I understand why you may
forget the conversation.

674
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:52,729
We also tried unsuccessfully
to contact you, Ms. Shannon.

675
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:55,832
So what do we do?

676
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:58,035
Based on your current behavior
and your history...

677
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:01,137
I think it might be time to consider

678
00:35:01,173 --> 00:35:04,775
allowing another guardian
to take care of Jeffrey.

679
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,976
Indefinitely.

680
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:08,478
I'm not gonna give my son
over to some stranger.

681
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:10,713
Unless things radically change,

682
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:14,717
that is going to remain
Jeffrey Jr.'s best option.

683
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:18,955
Philip?

684
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:19,956
Yeah!

685
00:35:19,991 --> 00:35:22,092
Just one minute!

686
00:35:23,228 --> 00:35:25,027
Who are you?

687
00:35:26,117 --> 00:35:27,296
This is Jenny.

688
00:35:27,331 --> 00:35:28,898
Hi.

689
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:30,532
Hello.

690
00:35:30,568 --> 00:35:32,468
Philip, can I talk to you for a second?

691
00:35:49,172 --> 00:35:51,386
Did you bring a 21st-er to Ops?

692
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:53,722
Well, actually, she's a Traveler.

693
00:35:53,757 --> 00:35:55,991
And that's better how?

694
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,892
So I'm gonna go.

695
00:35:57,928 --> 00:35:59,327
Good idea.

696
00:36:00,731 --> 00:36:02,196
Talk to you later?

697
00:36:05,102 --> 00:36:06,234
What's going on?

698
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:07,769
I'm clean, Marcy.

699
00:36:07,804 --> 00:36:08,837
That's how we met.

700
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:10,404
The Director sent her to help me.

701
00:36:12,575 --> 00:36:16,076
A synthesized drug
to help me get off heroin.

702
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:17,578
I need to know

703
00:36:17,614 --> 00:36:19,046
what this is made of.

704
00:36:19,081 --> 00:36:20,407
Naloxone, buprenorphine,

705
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:22,049
and some other things.

706
00:36:22,084 --> 00:36:23,151
What other things?

707
00:36:23,186 --> 00:36:25,453
I don't care. It works!

708
00:36:25,488 --> 00:36:27,221
My body doesn't hurt when I'm not high.

709
00:36:27,257 --> 00:36:28,330
I get to have a normal life.

710
00:36:28,365 --> 00:36:30,429
There's nothing normal about this!

711
00:36:30,465 --> 00:36:31,714
Why?

712
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:35,582
Because I met someone?

713
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,399
You have somebody.

714
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,702
Not anymore.

715
00:36:42,805 --> 00:36:44,237
I'm gonna stay here for a while,

716
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:46,874
until I find my own place.

717
00:36:47,313 --> 00:36:48,741
Of course.

718
00:36:49,148 --> 00:36:51,067
This place is yours, too.

719
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,072
You okay?

720
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:55,280
I'm fine.

721
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:02,095
Mr. Holden.

722
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,229
Mr. Doc.

723
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:04,898
What's the prognosis?

724
00:37:05,563 --> 00:37:07,195
Still a lot of inflammation.

725
00:37:07,231 --> 00:37:08,763
Do you feel anything yet?

726
00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:10,565
Even pins and needles?

727
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,900
I think so.

728
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:14,202
It's hard to say.

729
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:17,302
Well... let's, uh, do the test again.

730
00:37:18,393 --> 00:37:19,341
Ow!

731
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:20,943
Oh, I felt that.

732
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:22,610
And movement. That is excellent.

733
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:24,078
Excellent!

734
00:37:24,113 --> 00:37:25,680
- Does this mean...?
- It means there's hope!

735
00:37:26,102 --> 00:37:27,582
Wow.

736
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:29,517
Thank you so much.

737
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:31,307
Would you like me to contact your folks?

738
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:32,987
I-I would like that very much, yes,

739
00:37:33,022 --> 00:37:34,255
because they'll want to thank you, too.

740
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,257
I'll check in again later
before I go today,

741
00:37:36,292 --> 00:37:37,883
but how about one of these, buddy?

742
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:38,938
All right.

743
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:46,500
Hope?

744
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,371
There are medical nanites
designed in the future

745
00:37:50,406 --> 00:37:52,340
swimming through your spinal fluid

746
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,308
that I programmed personally,
repairing the damage.

747
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:55,642
There was never any doubt.

748
00:37:55,678 --> 00:37:58,378
Well, I wanted him to feel good
about the job that they did.

749
00:37:58,413 --> 00:38:00,146
Well, I want them to bring breakfast.

750
00:38:00,182 --> 00:38:01,815
They're half an hour late already,

751
00:38:01,851 --> 00:38:03,264
and I'm starving.

752
00:38:03,752 --> 00:38:05,285
Thank you for saving me, Grace.

753
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,768
You already said that.

754
00:38:54,535 --> 00:38:55,501
Hi.

755
00:38:55,536 --> 00:38:56,601
Come on in.

756
00:39:13,186 --> 00:39:14,553
Carly, what're you doing?

757
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:15,720
What do you think?

758
00:39:15,756 --> 00:39:17,022
You're not gonna find anything.

759
00:39:17,057 --> 00:39:18,232
I told you,

760
00:39:18,267 --> 00:39:19,857
I stopped drinking. This is for real.

761
00:39:19,892 --> 00:39:21,159
No, Jeff.

762
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:22,826
This is for show.

763
00:39:22,862 --> 00:39:25,396
And you better not screw it up...

764
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,533
because this is our one chance
to get Jeffrey back.

765
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:31,569
Don't worry. It's gonna work.

766
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:33,260
The big question is,

767
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:36,774
where do I put my, uh, stuff?

768
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,346
By the couch.

769
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,486
Hey, um, you hungry?

770
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,997
I was thinking...

771
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,742
She's not here, is she?

772
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,612
The bitchy little blonde?

773
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:17,213
"Marcy"

774
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,082
is out looking for an apartment.

775
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,818
That's why I texted.

776
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:23,119
You seen this?

777
00:40:24,788 --> 00:40:26,755
His followers went nuts on him,

778
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,124
and then, this morning,

779
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:30,759
he woke up, shot his wife and his kid,

780
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:32,228
before he killed himself.

781
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,695
- Philip, I know...
- His wife and child

782
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,364
...Are dead and it's our fault.

783
00:40:35,399 --> 00:40:36,732
You mean my fault.

784
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,033
I mean this is fucked up, Jenny!

785
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,136
No. It really isn't.

786
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:40,522
None of this would've happened

787
00:40:40,557 --> 00:40:42,004
if you hadn't hacked his presentation.

788
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,773
He probably would've
gone on spewing hate

789
00:40:44,808 --> 00:40:48,209
that led to the deaths
of hundreds of people.

790
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,878
Thousands!

791
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:51,412
You tell me, you're the historian.

792
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:52,881
It's not up to us.

793
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,116
I didn't tell him

794
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,450
to kill his family.

795
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:56,818
All I did

796
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,773
was tell the truth.

797
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:02,056
And his wife and child?

798
00:41:02,091 --> 00:41:03,924
The world is a better place

799
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,593
without Edwin Calloway.

800
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,594
And I'm sorry,

801
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,263
maybe he took some innocent people

802
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:09,264
down with him,

803
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:11,499
but I refuse to feel guilty about it.

804
00:41:11,953 --> 00:41:14,001
Yeah, well, the Director's gonna know.

805
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:16,837
If the Director thought
what we were doing was wrong,

806
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:18,839
why didn't I get a messenger?

807
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:23,210
Orders from another team to back off?

808
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:26,413
Can you look me in the eye and tell me

809
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:28,615
what I did was not a good thing?

810
00:41:49,171 --> 00:41:50,034
Kat.

811
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:51,604
Grant, what are you doing here?

812
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,173
You can't just show up here.

813
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:55,008
Kat. I know.

814
00:41:55,043 --> 00:41:55,975
What?

815
00:41:56,011 --> 00:41:57,543
That you're pregnant.

816
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:01,614
What? Did you show your badge
to my obstetrician?

817
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:02,949
No.

818
00:42:02,984 --> 00:42:04,116
Can I come in?

819
00:42:07,154 --> 00:42:09,655
I saw your supplements in the bathroom.

820
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:11,990
You went through my things?

821
00:42:12,026 --> 00:42:12,991
Yes, I did,

822
00:42:13,027 --> 00:42:14,193
and you can give me shit for that

823
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:15,194
after we talk.

824
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,567
I am not doing that.

825
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:18,264
Yes, you are.

826
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:19,932
Kat!

827
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:22,534
It happened the night
of your surprise party,

828
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:25,204
the one time we made love
in the past four months.

829
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,338
I just found out.

830
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:31,744
I haven't even decided
to go through with it yet.

831
00:42:32,325 --> 00:42:33,846
It was hard enough before,

832
00:42:33,881 --> 00:42:35,180
when I knew how you felt about me.

833
00:42:35,216 --> 00:42:36,215
You do know how I feel about...

834
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,282
And if I decide not to,

835
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:40,374
I won't have you standing there
judging me.

836
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:44,756
This is something we wanted
more than anything.

837
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:49,160
It's my decision to make,
and I'm gonna do it on my own.

838
00:42:51,598 --> 00:42:53,664
You should go.

839
00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:14,285
So, the Tuscan villa,
the Whistler chalet,

840
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,553
and the Caribbean hideaway...

841
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:18,355
Three stunning properties

842
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:22,726
all for the price of two
or three normal vacations.

843
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:28,298
All right.

844
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,867
I can tell you need
a little more motivation.

845
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:32,302
I'll go see if my manager

846
00:43:32,337 --> 00:43:34,905
can knock a few dollars
off the purchase price.

847
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,722
I'll be right back.

848
00:43:56,413 --> 00:44:04,438
