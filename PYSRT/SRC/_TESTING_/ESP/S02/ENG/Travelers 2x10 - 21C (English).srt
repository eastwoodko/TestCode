1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,754
Previously, on Travelers...

2
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:05,055
Get off of me! You killed my child!

3
00:00:05,057 --> 00:00:06,556
The Director was the one who sent me!

4
00:00:06,558 --> 00:00:08,525
I was on a mission!

5
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:09,927
You're alive because of me.

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,362
And perfectly healthy.

7
00:00:11,364 --> 00:00:12,743
Am I?

8
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:14,731
When you reset me,

9
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:16,500
you left out some things.

10
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:18,402
She left out

11
00:00:18,404 --> 00:00:19,895
what made me "me".

12
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:21,872
After the plane crash
that should've killed me,

13
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:23,440
my own consciousness

14
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:26,042
took refuge in the memories
of Grant MacLaren.

15
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:27,911
How do I possibly access that?

16
00:00:27,913 --> 00:00:29,513
You're the doctor.

17
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:51,552

00:03:23,515 --> 00:03:25,463
He thinks you don't like him.

19
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,651
You know what, who cares if I don't?

20
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:29,553
Well, he does.

21
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:31,121
He should get over it.

22
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:33,591
Anna, I don't think you get it.

23
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:34,992
Don't think I get what?

24
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:39,023
Bree?

25
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,965
Bree?

26
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:44,867
Anna Hamilton?
I'm Agent Hall with the FBI.

27
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,436
For your safety,
I need you to come with me.

28
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:48,037
What happened to my friends?

29
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,772
Your friends are gonna be fine,

30
00:03:49,774 --> 00:03:51,674
but you won't be, unless
you get in the car right now.

31
00:03:51,676 --> 00:03:52,942
Tell me why.

32
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:57,080
No! No! No!

33
00:03:57,082 --> 00:04:00,650
Ah! No!

34
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,465
Anna? Anna!

35
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:19,602
Anna!

36
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:32,347
What... will.. you... be?

37
00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:41,143
What ww-will you b-become?

38
00:04:42,693 --> 00:04:44,073
That's so good!

39
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,613
You wanna try the next part?

40
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:46,628
No.

41
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,717
Come on, girl. You can do it.

42
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:50,803
Tomorrow.

43
00:04:50,805 --> 00:04:52,680
It can't always say "tomorrow".

44
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,777
I'm here now, so let's try it.

45
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,938
Marcy! Mercy me. Time to rock and roll.

46
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,541
This is her reading time.

47
00:04:59,543 --> 00:05:00,708
The man wants to see her now,

48
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,709
which makes it

49
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:03,044
treatment time.

50
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:04,378
Let's go.

51
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,960
I told her she didn't have to go today.

52
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:08,649
Well, you shouldn't have said that, bud.

53
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:09,650
I don't...

54
00:05:09,652 --> 00:05:11,719
I don't want t-treatment!

55
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:14,021
No! No!

56
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,248
Hey. She's a person.
Treat her with respect.

57
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,992
You do your fricking job,
or you won't have one.

58
00:05:19,674 --> 00:05:21,528
I don't want to go...

59
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,596
I don't wanna go!

60
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:24,565
I'll be here for you when it's over.

61
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:26,132
No!

62
00:05:26,134 --> 00:05:29,236
James! James!

63
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,406
I don't want treatment!

64
00:05:32,408 --> 00:05:34,107
I don't want it.

65
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:35,408
I don't want it.

66
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,776
Hey. Hey.

67
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:38,411
Behave,

68
00:05:38,413 --> 00:05:40,313
or there'll be no ice cream after.

69
00:05:40,315 --> 00:05:43,583
I don't want it. I don't want it.

70
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:45,384
I don't want it.

71
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,620
Dear, sweet Marcy.

72
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:50,256
Don't be afraid, dear.

73
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:53,158
I have no desire to hurt you,

74
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,461
and I mean that sincerely.

75
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,230
No, quite the opposite.

76
00:05:59,033 --> 00:06:01,434
I only want to make you whole again.

77
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:08,774
What'd the messenger say?

78
00:06:08,776 --> 00:06:10,776
Another Traveler team
needs tactical support

79
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:12,377
in less than an hour
at these coordinates.

80
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:14,146
Got it. Where's the boss?

81
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,115
Mac, where are you?

82
00:06:16,117 --> 00:06:17,950
Must be off-com.

83
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:19,584
We can stop by
Kathryn's place on the way.

84
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:20,786
Where's Marcy?

85
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:21,887
She just texted me.

86
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:24,383
She's having some kind
of medical procedure.

87
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:26,891
We're just gonna have to do
the mission without her.

88
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:28,760
Okay, so nobody get shot today.

89
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:30,328
That's a good rule in general.

90
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:35,567
Hello?

91
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:38,637
Hi. I'm so sorry to bother you
at home, Kathryn.

92
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,904
What? How do you know my name?

93
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,572
He's one of my C.I.'s,

94
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:43,440
who knows better than to come here.

95
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:45,143
It's an urgent C.I. thing.

96
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:46,144
All right.

97
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:48,246
Are you the one
who stole my husband's car?

98
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:49,647
Well, actually, that's a funny story.

99
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,103
For another time.

100
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,450
Be back soon.

101
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:07,623
Look, um...

102
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,423
I need this job.

103
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,263
Just, uh...

104
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:18,975
Don't let it melt.

105
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,343
Marcy?

106
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,087
Did it work this time?

107
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:33,456
Oh.

108
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,524
I told him

109
00:07:34,526 --> 00:07:36,959
information transfer
was way, way too slow.

110
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:38,461
I tried to fix it.

111
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,743
To get you back in...

112
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,334
You're still in there.

113
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:47,669
You don't know because you're not here.

114
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:50,873
He knows.

115
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:52,843
I'll keep trying,

116
00:07:52,868 --> 00:07:55,708
but squid transistors
barely even exist here and now.

117
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,063
You gonna eat that?

118
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,463
Can I have it?

119
00:08:00,818 --> 00:08:02,303
Okay.

120
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:09,891
Well, if they're after me, then...

121
00:08:09,893 --> 00:08:11,960
how do you know my parents are safe?

122
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:12,961
Well, because

123
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:14,696
they're also under protection.

124
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:16,365
Right? And that's question number six.

125
00:08:19,737 --> 00:08:21,970
Oh, great.

126
00:08:23,073 --> 00:08:24,744
What the hell are you doing here?

127
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:27,541
I'm not exactly thrilled about it either.

128
00:08:27,543 --> 00:08:28,542
We got a messenger.

129
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:30,075
Tactical support at these coordinates.

130
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,612
Tactical?

131
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:33,882
I don't know. I, uh, I think we're good.

132
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:36,217
The Director doesn't seem to think so.

133
00:08:36,623 --> 00:08:38,386
Where are all the customers?

134
00:08:38,388 --> 00:08:40,053
You ever eat here?

135
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:41,503
I like it.

136
00:08:44,186 --> 00:08:45,551
Who's she?

137
00:08:46,262 --> 00:08:48,128
That's, uh, 53.

138
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,583
As in "P.O.T.U.S."

139
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,227
Centuries before my time,

140
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:54,261
but I'm pretty sure

141
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:56,063
the 53rd President
was another old white guy.

142
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:59,399
Do you even remember
the other candidate that year?

143
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,768
How close that election was,

144
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,336
and how the country was torn apart after?

145
00:09:05,141 --> 00:09:07,841
Anna, say hello
to Special Agent MacLaren.

146
00:09:07,843 --> 00:09:08,842
It's an honor

147
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:10,042
to meet you, Ms. Hamilton.

148
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:15,903
Hi.

149
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:19,653
So, are you assigned to protect me, too?

150
00:09:19,655 --> 00:09:21,120
- Actually...
- Yeah, you know, he is.

151
00:09:21,122 --> 00:09:22,121
Until 1600 hours.

152
00:09:22,123 --> 00:09:23,923
Why do I need protection?

153
00:09:23,925 --> 00:09:24,924
Hey, we had an agreement, right?

154
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:26,659
Ten questions? You're already at eight.

155
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:28,027
Ten questions?

156
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,352
Yeah, whatever.

157
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:30,930
What happens at 1600?

158
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:32,398
How the hell should I know?

159
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,233
All I got to do is make sure
that, until then, she's...

160
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,301
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

161
00:09:35,303 --> 00:09:37,469
Get her to cover now. Now!

162
00:09:44,178 --> 00:09:45,811
FBI! Get down and stay down!

163
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:50,623
We just lost a camera.

164
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:53,652
Tracking four targets.

165
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:57,356
You call this "tactical"?

166
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:58,624
Carly! Trevor?

167
00:09:58,626 --> 00:09:59,524
Ready, boss!

168
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:00,992
In position.

169
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:08,300
Ah!

170
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:11,837
Trevor, your 9:00,

171
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,471
moving toward the west side
of the restaurant.

172
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:36,393
The Director got the last one.

173
00:10:36,395 --> 00:10:37,394
We can't count on

174
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:38,896
the Director to have eyes everywhere.

175
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:39,864
We should move.

176
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:40,998
Stand by.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,499
We're moving somewhere safe.

178
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,701
You know, we were fine
until you showed up.

179
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:46,036
They must've followed you.

180
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:47,771
If we hadn't been
ordered here, you'd be dead,

181
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:48,905
and so would 53,

182
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:50,907
who I am taking to a safehouse right now,

183
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:51,875
with or without you.

184
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:53,623
MacLaren's right.

185
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:55,679
We should go.

186
00:10:58,884 --> 00:11:01,551
Yeah, yeah.

187
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,096
Come on, girl. Eat up.

188
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:10,464
I don't have time for this shit.

189
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:12,666
You know what happens if you don't.

190
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:14,568
I w-want to go home.

191
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,603
This is home now.

192
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:19,324
No, I w-work here.

193
00:11:20,164 --> 00:11:21,875
Get that outta your head.

194
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:23,644
I remember.

195
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:24,645
All right.

196
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,900
Doesn't have to be the hard way.

197
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:28,318
Don't make me do that.

198
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,312
Hey!

199
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,018
You do it again and I'll report you!

200
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:33,881
You'll report me?

201
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,751
I'm not the one who looks at her ass

202
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:39,020
every time she walks away.

203
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:40,821
I don't do that.

204
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:42,256
Don't get me wrong, it's a...

205
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:44,858
Treat her with respect,
or I'll talk to Dr. Carroll.

206
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,027
Carroll?

207
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:47,228
Ha! That's perfect.

208
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,229
Boom!

209
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:49,563
Yeah, you go ahead and do that,

210
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:52,599
while I feed your hot little girlfriend.

211
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,340
You are done.

212
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:02,224
Don't even bother signing out.

213
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:04,204
I don't wanna see your face.

214
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:19,092
I need to use the bathroom.

215
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:20,260
It's not far now.

216
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:21,894
You just have to hold it
a little longer...

217
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:24,597
...Madame President.

218
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:28,963
So in this timeline,
she actually wins the election.

219
00:12:28,964 --> 00:12:30,296
Why would the faction not want that?

220
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:31,931
'Cause they're working off
old information.

221
00:12:32,484 --> 00:12:33,933
Where are we going?

222
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:35,734
That's an excellent question, Anna.

223
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:36,869
You, uh, you got one left.

224
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,871
To an old farmhouse that I know of.

225
00:12:38,873 --> 00:12:40,372
We should be safe there.

226
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:41,640
That's what Special Agent Hall

227
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:43,709
said about the restaurant.

228
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:44,844
"Agent"?

229
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:46,712
"Special".

230
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:49,448
Why isn't Marcy with you?

231
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,216
Some sort of minor medical procedure

232
00:12:51,218 --> 00:12:52,317
I wish she'd told me about.

233
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:53,418
Is she all right?

234
00:12:54,721 --> 00:12:56,684
I'm sure she's fine.

235
00:13:16,643 --> 00:13:19,524
Simon... that's beautiful.

236
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:21,045
Thank you.

237
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:22,379
I like it.

238
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:24,381
Who is she?

239
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,417
0092.

240
00:13:26,884 --> 00:13:28,252
No, I mean, what's her name?

241
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,920
0092.

242
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,756
She's not born for another two...

243
00:13:33,084 --> 00:13:34,825
no, hundreds of years from now.

244
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:37,228
Oh! That's a very long time.

245
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,729
Yes, it is.

246
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:40,998
Home, sweet home...

247
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,434
The ozone layer is gone by then.

248
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:45,435
That's just one problem.

249
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:47,303
In a hundred years,
there are way worse...

250
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:48,908
we live under the ice.

251
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,007
Oh...

252
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:52,427
The math's not that complicated,

253
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:55,245
You have two people
that want the same thing...

254
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:58,025
the two people fight over the one,

255
00:13:58,027 --> 00:13:59,218
and then there's none.

256
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,416
Well...

257
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:01,917
I have

258
00:14:02,664 --> 00:14:03,884
two pills...

259
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:06,689
For one person.

260
00:14:06,691 --> 00:14:08,358
Okay? There you go.

261
00:14:09,764 --> 00:14:12,462
I'm not supposed to take
anything before treatment.

262
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:14,364
Marcy, isn't it?

263
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,766
Uh, yeah.

264
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:18,134
Good, I was hoping to catch you.

265
00:14:18,136 --> 00:14:19,268
Simon is correct

266
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,837
that I prefer he not be medicated

267
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,938
during the treatment.

268
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,840
Oh, well, there's
a daily schedule, Mr. Ingram.

269
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:26,042
Maintenance of the yeast vats,

270
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:27,176
first and foremost,

271
00:14:27,178 --> 00:14:29,045
is your responsibility to the community.

272
00:14:29,047 --> 00:14:30,846
Please, Simon...

273
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:32,948
allow me to speak with the orderly.

274
00:14:33,924 --> 00:14:35,524
You go on ahead.

275
00:14:43,644 --> 00:14:45,564
An hour is all I ask.

276
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:47,929
Dr. Carroll approves.
You can check with her.

277
00:14:47,931 --> 00:14:49,764
Dr. Carroll's gone home, and I-I can't...

278
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:50,899
Perhaps if you understood

279
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:53,234
more about the therapy I was working on.

280
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,303
You're curious.

281
00:14:55,305 --> 00:14:56,304
Of course, you curious...

282
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,684
More concerned.

283
00:14:58,141 --> 00:14:59,207
A few of the patients

284
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,709
who've gone through your treatment...

285
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:02,210
haven't...

286
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:04,378
...Returned to the ward?

287
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,816
Because they've been transferred

288
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:09,883
to another hospital

289
00:15:09,885 --> 00:15:12,486
as promising candidates
for further research.

290
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:14,684
I can show you the paperwork.

291
00:15:16,964 --> 00:15:18,326
The work we're doing here

292
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:20,928
is truly for the greater good, Marcy.

293
00:15:22,164 --> 00:15:24,331
We're making progress, I promise.

294
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,536
In fact...

295
00:15:30,404 --> 00:15:32,906
if you're open to it,
I could use your help.

296
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:44,551
It's a nice spot.

297
00:15:44,553 --> 00:15:46,010
Glad you approve.

298
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,954
A sign on the road says it's for sale.

299
00:15:47,956 --> 00:15:49,088
Might be a good investment.

300
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,957
FBI seized the house from a meth cook

301
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,627
who burned himself to death
in the kitchen, so...

302
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:55,729
So, big kitchen?

303
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,131
I need you to set these claymores up

304
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,465
there and there.

305
00:15:59,467 --> 00:16:00,466
We can do that.

306
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:01,700
Conceal 'em best you can,

307
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,469
then run the wires back to the house.

308
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,905
What, you take orders
from your tactician?

309
00:16:06,404 --> 00:16:07,907
So should you.

310
00:16:09,364 --> 00:16:11,103
Hey, look, I can still tell

311
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:12,145
you got a problem with me,

312
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:13,211
but you gotta get over that, all right?

313
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:14,913
The Director keeps putting us together.

314
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:16,382
Must be some good reason.

315
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:17,883
"Ours is not to reason why."

316
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:18,984
It's like we're two disciples,

317
00:16:18,986 --> 00:16:20,386
but we don't see eye to eye.

318
00:16:20,388 --> 00:16:21,487
I'm not in the mood for mythology.

319
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:22,821
But we're both disciples, right,

320
00:16:22,823 --> 00:16:24,456
so what're you gonna do?

321
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:26,492
Hey, look, what I'm trying to say...

322
00:16:26,494 --> 00:16:28,727
Don't you freakin' touch me, Hall!

323
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:30,528
Take it easy. Relax.

324
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:33,932
Let's just get to 1600.

325
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:53,351
The technology scans the brain

326
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:56,421
and records specific patterns,

327
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:59,490
not dissimilar to something like an MRI.

328
00:16:59,954 --> 00:17:02,358
What exactly am I signing?

329
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,861
Legalese.

330
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:09,200
The fee for allowing me
to perform the scans

331
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,884
is on the last page.

332
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:18,503
That's a lot of money.

333
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,724
Is it?

334
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,275
I'm embarrassed to say
that I've lost perspective.

335
00:17:31,305 --> 00:17:33,524
Simon... what are you doing here?

336
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:37,124
I helped build the first one
in the future, too.

337
00:17:37,584 --> 00:17:39,317
Good for you.

338
00:17:39,846 --> 00:17:41,563
He likes to "assist."

339
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:43,615
I consider it part of his therapy.

340
00:17:44,004 --> 00:17:46,218
Um, Mr. Ingram...

341
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,554
uh, I've changed my mind.

342
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:50,556
You've signed the papers, you can't.

343
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:52,356
I just did.

344
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,512
Marcy, it's a harmless scan.

345
00:17:54,514 --> 00:17:55,894
You won't feel it.

346
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,162
Sorry, I don't...
I don't feel comfortable.

347
00:17:57,164 --> 00:17:58,329
Please, be reasonable.

348
00:17:58,331 --> 00:17:59,330
I'm sorry.

349
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:00,331
You can keep your money.

350
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,549
It's not about the money, my dear,

351
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:04,736
but now you've seen the device.

352
00:18:04,738 --> 00:18:06,071
This is awkward.

353
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:07,672
Drake!

354
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:11,576
- Move!
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

355
00:18:11,578 --> 00:18:12,843
Let go of me!

356
00:18:20,986 --> 00:18:23,387
You really should read
everything you sign.

357
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:24,909
No!

358
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:50,872
I'm always in awe
of the potential of youth.

359
00:18:51,555 --> 00:18:53,308
Of what may come.

360
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,600
Even if we didn't know who she was.

361
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:57,925
If we succeed in our mission,

362
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:58,874
she'll become

363
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,542
one of the great leaders of a generation.

364
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:01,566
Mm-hmm.

365
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:05,315
So I'd very much like to make it to 4:00.

366
00:19:05,902 --> 00:19:07,467
I wonder if it's a coincidence

367
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:08,555
that the Director assigned you

368
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:10,317
a mission to preserve the life of a child

369
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,115
after what happened to you and Kathryn.

370
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:15,891
I think the Director
isn't a licensed therapist,

371
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:17,491
and neither are you.

372
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:19,560
I do understand
what you're going through.

373
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:20,828
You couldn't possibly.

374
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,530
Yeah, I do.

375
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:24,338
Even you forget.

376
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:25,362
I've lived long enough

377
00:19:25,387 --> 00:19:27,854
to see two of my own sons die of old age.

378
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:30,831
Uh, no. This isn't the same thing.

379
00:19:30,856 --> 00:19:32,856
You're right, it isn't.

380
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:35,841
You're grieving a life lost
that hadn't even begun yet.

381
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:38,314
A loss of potential.

382
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:41,193
Anna has that.

383
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,681
All I'm saying.

384
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:53,075
We got vehicles.

385
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:56,763
Yeah. I see 'em. Anna!

386
00:19:56,765 --> 00:19:58,064
Get inside.

387
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,502
The Director will, too,
as soon as they get closer.

388
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:02,537
Smile for the camera, Mr. Faction.

389
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,590
Protocol three is suspended.

390
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:09,911
Protect Anna Hamilton at all costs

391
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:11,910
and hold until reinforcements arrive.

392
00:20:14,518 --> 00:20:16,384
What just happened?

393
00:20:16,386 --> 00:20:18,352
Nothing happened. Just go inside.

394
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,221
You're fine.

395
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:23,724
Here I thought we were gonna

396
00:20:23,726 --> 00:20:26,460
make it to 1600 without any trouble.

397
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,044
She doesn't even recognize me.

398
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:45,512
There was a malfunction.

399
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,848
Some information
was lost during the scan.

400
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,583
Simon is working to restore it soon.

401
00:20:49,585 --> 00:20:50,584
Simon?

402
00:20:50,586 --> 00:20:51,652
Until then, Marcy is now

403
00:20:51,654 --> 00:20:53,353
to be considered
a patient of this facility,

404
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:54,821
under the care of Dr. Carroll.

405
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:57,057
Dr. Carroll agreed to that?

406
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,259
And so will you.

407
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,361
I can make you very wealthy,

408
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:03,329
very easily.

409
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,468
We can move patients to different wings,

410
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,137
but there'll still be staff
who know Marcy as an employee.

411
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:14,574
Bribe those you can
and get rid of the rest.

412
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,809
I leave it to you.

413
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:39,965
The Director should

414
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,266
turn every one of them into hosts

415
00:21:41,268 --> 00:21:42,267
or kill them by messenger

416
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:43,335
as soon as they're on camera.

417
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:44,681
Maybe Anna should hide
upstairs and wait...

418
00:21:44,683 --> 00:21:46,504
Don't. If they don't find her,

419
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,139
they'll burn this place to the ground.

420
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,241
It's what I'd do.

421
00:21:50,243 --> 00:21:51,910
Really?

422
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,550
And you...

423
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:56,982
keep your head down.

424
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:58,650
Why do they want to hurt me?

425
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,986
Because they're afraid of you.

426
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:02,353
More than you?

427
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,150
Even more than me, yes.

428
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,270
Why don't we just talk to them?

429
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,960
Wow.

430
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,330
Even now...

431
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,799
Anna, this won't happen,

432
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,336
but if they manage
to get through this door

433
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,005
and they try to take you,

434
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,755
you fight them,

435
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:24,341
and you keep fighting,

436
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,750
because help is on the way. Okay?

437
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,110
Okay.

438
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,803
Seriously?

439
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:53,802
That's all we got.

440
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:56,110
No, this'll help.

441
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:02,030
Didn't think the Director
would let them get this close.

442
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:08,050
We can't wait for the Director.

443
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:10,710
Aim center mass. Shoot when I shoot.

444
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:23,556
Oh! Crash!

445
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:24,590
Sorry.

446
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:26,459
I didn't see that... that move comin'.

447
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:27,793
Are you okay?

448
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:30,996
I... I'm fine.

449
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,165
I'm fine.

450
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,933
Uh... I was...

451
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:36,501
I was watching you there a little bit,

452
00:24:36,503 --> 00:24:39,071
and I was thinking you looked lost.

453
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,240
Maybe I can help.

454
00:24:41,242 --> 00:24:42,903
Is there some family that I can...?

455
00:24:42,905 --> 00:24:44,509
Mm. Mm.

456
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,590
Turns out we're going
the same way anyway.

457
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,482
Um, what's your name?

458
00:24:50,484 --> 00:24:53,718
Uh, M... Marcy.

459
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,753
Marcy?

460
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:55,920
- Yeah.
- Seriously?

461
00:24:55,922 --> 00:24:56,888
Yeah.

462
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,490
That is easily

463
00:24:58,492 --> 00:25:00,958
in my top ten favorite names
in the whole world.

464
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,527
You're the first one I've met in person.

465
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,299
My name's David.

466
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:25,781
Four of them are coming around
the south side of the house.

467
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,534
Hall, that's you!

468
00:25:27,536 --> 00:25:29,324
I know! I know!

469
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,307
It's like the freakin' Alamo!
Where's the Director?

470
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,284
They've gotta have an S.T.A.!

471
00:25:37,573 --> 00:25:38,472
What?

472
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:41,270
"Space-Time Attenuation" device.

473
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,794
It creates a field around 'em

474
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:44,552
in which the Director can't see 'em.

475
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:48,457
I see the S.T.A.!

476
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,525
It's in the green truck under the tarp!

477
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:52,858
Trevor... we need an end-run.

478
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,959
Go.

479
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:57,529
Son of a bitch!

480
00:25:58,632 --> 00:25:59,965
Cover him!

481
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,901
Cover him!

482
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:16,315
Like I said, it isn't much...

483
00:26:17,308 --> 00:26:19,884
But it's not the street,

484
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,720
and it's subsidized.

485
00:26:21,722 --> 00:26:24,689
Do... Do you live... here?

486
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:26,865
No.

487
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,884
This is your place now, remember?

488
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:31,362
See, there's a...

489
00:26:31,364 --> 00:26:33,044
there's a bed in here with...

490
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:37,235
clean sheets, like I promised,

491
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:38,569
and...

492
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:41,004
good, there's a towel, too.

493
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,188
And a dresser for all your things.

494
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:49,164
So first thing tomorrow,
we'll... we'll go...

495
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:51,604
get you some things.

496
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:55,444
And here, there's a little fridge,

497
00:26:56,644 --> 00:27:00,257
to keep your milk
for your cereal or your tea.

498
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:01,792
Do you like tea? Oh, looks like...

499
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:03,964
the previous tenant
left a big chunk of chocolate!

500
00:27:04,463 --> 00:27:05,764
No, that's hash.

501
00:27:07,245 --> 00:27:08,565
Take that away.

502
00:27:09,435 --> 00:27:11,204
And...

503
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,773
Good! That works, too.

504
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:18,708
You have a light to read your book by.

505
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:23,324
So, I will let you get settled in.

506
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,943
N-No... d-don't go.

507
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:29,884
Oh, I have to go.

508
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:32,084
I have other clients.

509
00:27:32,604 --> 00:27:37,373
I-I did look up the hospital
you said you were a patient at.

510
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:38,464
I w-work there.

511
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:41,097
You work there?

512
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:42,063
Mm-hmm.

513
00:27:42,065 --> 00:27:43,112
Huh.

514
00:27:43,114 --> 00:27:44,901
Well, that's different.

515
00:27:44,903 --> 00:27:46,913
Either way, they said
they have no record of you.

516
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,966
Oh!

517
00:27:47,968 --> 00:27:49,805
Don't go!

518
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:50,839
Okay.

519
00:27:53,831 --> 00:27:55,524
I still have to go.

520
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,459
But I will be back tomorrow morning

521
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,035
to take you shopping.

522
00:28:00,604 --> 00:28:02,238
Oh, don't do that.

523
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:04,305
Oh, uh...

524
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,474
- Okay?
- Okay.

525
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,882
Don't forget to lock up.

526
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:15,404
Okay.

527
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:23,155
Okay.

528
00:28:42,244 --> 00:28:43,884
David?

529
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,550
Surprise!

530
00:28:49,924 --> 00:28:51,185
Hey.

531
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,519
I know I said the paperwork

532
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:54,721
was gonna take seven days, but...

533
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:58,125
...It only took a week.

534
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,650
Oh, you put some pictures up.

535
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:08,684
Nice.

536
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:13,558
Uh, so this is the paperwork
we need to sign,

537
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:15,091
in order to get you something to live on.

538
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:16,415
I've already filled out most of it,

539
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,540
we're just missing some things.

540
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,113
Um...

541
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:22,248
Do you happen to remember your birthday?

542
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,785
Well, that's not a problem.

543
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:28,921
We'll... We'll... We'll pick a day.

544
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:30,556
Oh...

545
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:31,991
Oh, wait! It's today.

546
00:29:31,993 --> 00:29:33,644
What are the odds?

547
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:36,362
Well, one in 365,

548
00:29:36,364 --> 00:29:38,464
but so long as we're saying today...

549
00:29:41,603 --> 00:29:44,503
It's for... for my birth... birthday?

550
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:45,604
Yeah.

551
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:47,444
Everybody deserves a birthday present.

552
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,831
It's not brand-new,

553
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,180
but, uh, it'll hold your stuff
when you go outside.

554
00:29:58,604 --> 00:30:00,118
Ohh...

555
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:03,821
My mom always says that it's bad luck

556
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:06,124
to give a bag as a gift
without putting money in it...

557
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:08,492
which, I guess, is why

558
00:30:08,494 --> 00:30:10,694
I asked for a new bag every Christmas.

559
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:13,864
The only thing we need
to figure out now is your age.

560
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:18,702
I'm guessing somewhere between 22 and 26.

561
00:30:18,704 --> 00:30:20,004
You pick.

562
00:30:20,352 --> 00:30:22,351
You pick.

563
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:25,475
42.

564
00:30:27,146 --> 00:30:28,779
56?

565
00:30:30,124 --> 00:30:31,181
Seven?

566
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:32,732
No!

567
00:30:32,734 --> 00:30:34,818
Well, you told me to pick.

568
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,353
Okay. We'll go...

569
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,556
We'll go with 25.

570
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:13,054
Carly?

571
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,656
I see it.

572
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:20,529
Hit the claymores!

573
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:21,896
Wait for my order.

574
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:32,040
Philip, there's two
going around the back!

575
00:31:32,042 --> 00:31:33,274
Understood.

576
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:08,375
It stopped short of the mines.

577
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:14,547
Carly!

578
00:33:21,564 --> 00:33:23,448
"'You're...

579
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,416
"a...

580
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:27,017
"big...

581
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:28,786
"girl now, '

582
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:30,822
"said...

583
00:33:30,824 --> 00:33:33,324
M-Mary's teacher."

584
00:33:36,924 --> 00:33:39,196
I couldn't have read it better myself.

585
00:33:39,198 --> 00:33:40,630
Have you been practicing?

586
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:41,598
Mm-hmm.

587
00:33:43,069 --> 00:33:44,568
Well, that deserves a...

588
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,004
I better check to see what I have on me

589
00:33:47,006 --> 00:33:49,240
before I start making promises.

590
00:33:52,144 --> 00:33:53,777
Oh, no, no, that's for you to buy

591
00:33:53,779 --> 00:33:55,484
things you need.

592
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:58,524
Okay, we'll call it a loan.

593
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:00,684
Come on.

594
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,795
Marcy, what are you doing?

595
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,898
You're m-my... you're my boyfriend.

596
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,567
I-I can't be your boyfriend.

597
00:34:19,444 --> 00:34:20,904
I can be your friend.

598
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,274
It's not because I don't like you,

599
00:34:24,276 --> 00:34:25,508
or that you're not

600
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:28,378
one of my favorite people
in the whole world.

601
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,912
It's because it would...

602
00:34:30,244 --> 00:34:32,084
it would be inappropriate.

603
00:34:34,285 --> 00:34:37,052
Yeah, I know that's a...
that's a big word.

604
00:34:37,054 --> 00:34:38,053
Mm-hmm.

605
00:34:38,055 --> 00:34:39,244
Listen.

606
00:34:39,924 --> 00:34:41,557
Boyfriends come and go...

607
00:34:42,524 --> 00:34:44,226
but if you want,

608
00:34:44,524 --> 00:34:46,764
you can be my B.F.F.

609
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:50,098
That means "Best Friend Forever".

610
00:34:51,468 --> 00:34:52,968
And I don't just call anybody that.

611
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:14,895
4:00.

612
00:35:15,295 --> 00:35:16,863
Where does the time go?

613
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,032
Is it over, Agent Hall?

614
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,202
Yeah, I think so, Anna.

615
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,904
You agree, Agent MacLaren?

616
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:26,373
Sure.

617
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,676
Gotta go! I'm late!

618
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:31,215
For what?

619
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:35,937
Mom? Dad!

620
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:52,707
Mom. Dad. All these people were trying...

621
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:53,689
We know.

622
00:35:53,691 --> 00:35:54,876
I was so scared.

623
00:35:54,878 --> 00:35:56,644
It's all right, Anna.
They told us what happened.

624
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:58,255
But we're here now,

625
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:01,377
and we're gonna take you
some place safe, okay?

626
00:36:15,163 --> 00:36:18,231
Hey, it's me,
I'm gonna be home around 5:00,

627
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:19,800
which is when I'm usually home,

628
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,234
but you asked when I was gonna be home,

629
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:23,637
so I am just confirming.

630
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:29,575
Did any of your people get hurt?

631
00:36:29,577 --> 00:36:30,643
Everybody made it.

632
00:36:30,645 --> 00:36:32,245
Why did you do this for me?

633
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:33,644
Ooh, no. That's...

634
00:36:33,646 --> 00:36:36,082
That's too bad,
that's question number eleven.

635
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,254
The future's gonna need people like you.

636
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:44,697
Thank you.

637
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:47,297
And thank you.

638
00:36:50,697 --> 00:36:52,197
Bye, everyone.

639
00:36:56,295 --> 00:36:57,373
I assume

640
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:00,739
her parents historically died
trying to protect her.

641
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:02,907
3:43 this afternoon.

642
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,009
We'll make sure she never knows.

643
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:05,643
Well, you'd better take good care of her,

644
00:37:05,645 --> 00:37:07,471
or you're gonna be
answering to both of us.

645
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:09,587
We trained for years to do just that.

646
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:11,017
Good.

647
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:16,088
Agent MacLaren.

648
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:20,257
Agent Hall.

649
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:23,297
Bugs the shit out of you, doesn't it?

650
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:29,100
Yep.

651
00:37:30,103 --> 00:37:31,469
I got your favorite.

652
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:33,437
"Police were forced to use tear gas

653
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:34,472
"to disperse a crowd

654
00:37:34,474 --> 00:37:36,040
"shortly after a not-guilty verdict

655
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:38,442
was announced outside of the..."

656
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:40,878
What?

657
00:37:42,497 --> 00:37:43,947
I don't want to say anything

658
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,897
until we talk to a doctor, but...

659
00:37:47,897 --> 00:37:49,887
I think a miracle just happened.

660
00:37:51,423 --> 00:37:52,589
Marcy?

661
00:37:53,592 --> 00:37:55,091
Marcy?

662
00:37:55,093 --> 00:37:56,292
Marcy!

663
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:08,071
You know, I think,

664
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:10,606
if I die in my sleep tonight,

665
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:12,608
I'm good to go.

666
00:38:24,488 --> 00:38:26,822
One... two... three... four...

667
00:38:26,824 --> 00:38:28,758
One... two... three...

668
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:31,243
Where's her medical kit?

669
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:32,343
What happened? What did she do?

670
00:38:32,345 --> 00:38:33,711
I just got here myself!
Just get the bag...

671
00:38:33,713 --> 00:38:34,746
- ...And bring it over here.
- Was she shot?

672
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:36,481
Get the bag!

673
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,563
Can you charge the defibrillator?

674
00:38:41,565 --> 00:38:42,486
What?

675
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:43,980
It's okay. Just take over.

676
00:38:43,982 --> 00:38:45,457
Get the bag and take over.

677
00:38:46,725 --> 00:38:48,225
Go, go, go, go, go!

678
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:53,030
One, two, three, four, five...

679
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:57,401
Mm. I can't believe
how much you suck at this.

680
00:38:57,403 --> 00:38:59,403
This is nothing like actual surgery.

681
00:38:59,405 --> 00:39:00,737
No, well, "wrenched elbow",
that's the easiest one.

682
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:01,738
That's not even a thing.

683
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,788
No, it is.

684
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,508
You know, I think I might
be a better doctor than you.

685
00:39:10,783 --> 00:39:12,215
Oh, she's coming back.

686
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,382
Oh, thank God.

687
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,383
All right. Help me.

688
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,418
Help me get her into the bed.

689
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,752
We've gotta get her body temperature up.

690
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:19,455
I thought something
terrible had happened to you.

691
00:39:19,777 --> 00:39:21,457
You must be David.

692
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,260
I'm told we're close.

693
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:25,697
"Close"?

694
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:30,199
Marcy, we're very...

695
00:39:31,097 --> 00:39:31,867
close.

696
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:32,697
W...

697
00:39:35,537 --> 00:39:36,972
What's wrong?

698
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,315
No...

699
00:40:21,817 --> 00:40:23,450
I'll yell at you later.

700
00:40:25,737 --> 00:40:28,417
You find the missing pieces
you were looking for?

701
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:39,700
David...

702
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:42,536
you weren't supposed
to find that unless...

703
00:40:42,538 --> 00:40:43,857
Unless you'd died.

704
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:46,897
Yeah, I figured that one out.

705
00:40:48,777 --> 00:40:50,110
How could you do this?

706
00:40:51,777 --> 00:40:54,347
Knowing that I was probably
gonna be the one to find you?

707
00:40:57,377 --> 00:40:59,137
Right now she needs to rest.

708
00:41:02,777 --> 00:41:04,124
Yeah.

709
00:41:04,933 --> 00:41:06,165
Whatever.

710
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,504
Hey.

711
00:41:19,817 --> 00:41:22,141
Sorry I was gone so long.

712
00:41:22,143 --> 00:41:24,937
It's okay. I was just dozing.

713
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,093
Everything okay?

714
00:41:30,084 --> 00:41:32,777
Yeah. Everything's fine.

715
00:41:37,897 --> 00:41:40,392
I saved a kid today.

716
00:42:05,297 --> 00:42:06,584
David?

717
00:42:14,786 --> 00:42:16,786
_

718
00:42:22,702 --> 00:42:24,434
Oh. Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later.

719
00:42:24,777 --> 00:42:25,769
Hey.

720
00:42:25,771 --> 00:42:27,104
Hi.

721
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:29,974
I wanted to talk to you
before you left for work.

722
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,297
Yeah, no, I, uh...

723
00:42:33,257 --> 00:42:35,445
thought maybe you'd want
to thaw some more.

724
00:42:37,497 --> 00:42:38,857
Can we talk?

725
00:42:39,451 --> 00:42:40,937
Sure.

726
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,455
If you wouldn't have found the note,

727
00:42:45,457 --> 00:42:46,956
you would have never known.

728
00:42:47,657 --> 00:42:49,125
Doesn't make it better.

729
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:51,628
It was the only way, David.

730
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,262
To do what?

731
00:42:53,577 --> 00:42:56,265
To find the missing pieces of myself.

732
00:42:56,267 --> 00:42:57,466
To find you.

733
00:42:57,468 --> 00:42:58,635
Okay, so?

734
00:42:58,637 --> 00:43:00,003
Was it worth almost killing yourself?

735
00:43:00,005 --> 00:43:01,270
Because honestly, this is...

736
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:18,620
Well, that was different.

737
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:21,523
I'm sorry that I scared you.

738
00:43:23,537 --> 00:43:25,661
You have no idea.

739
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:27,863
If I hadn't...

740
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,168
What?

741
00:43:36,057 --> 00:43:37,457
What is it?

742
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:40,275
Do you know who did this?

743
00:43:41,137 --> 00:43:43,180
Uh, yeah...

744
00:43:43,182 --> 00:43:45,224
some homeless guy, lives around here.

745
00:43:45,226 --> 00:43:46,281
Why?

746
00:43:46,977 --> 00:43:48,849
I need you to take me to him.

747
00:43:57,397 --> 00:44:05,485
