1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,400
Previously, on Travelers...

2
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:02,865
- FBI.
- Ted Bishop.

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,533
Flight 329 to Washington goes down

4
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:05,768
at 2:53 P.M.

5
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:10,976
You're not the E.M.T. team
I was expecting.

6
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:14,111
Traveler 3569, welcome to the 21st.

7
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:15,157
You seen my eyedrops?

8
00:00:15,192 --> 00:00:16,625
What's going on, Man?

9
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:17,660
Give me back my drops.

10
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:18,761
Here. It's a good thing

11
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:21,163
these are helping
with your addiction, huh?

12
00:00:21,198 --> 00:00:22,764
- I know.
- What?

13
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:23,966
That you're pregnant.

14
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:26,335
I'm just trying
to find the missing pieces.

15
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,769
Maybe someone is best defined

16
00:00:27,804 --> 00:00:30,339
by how they affect
the people around them.

17
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:42,316
"Helix"?

18
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:43,852
"Sandstorm."

19
00:00:43,887 --> 00:00:44,986
Prove it.

20
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:52,965
_

21
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:05,006
Did you bring it?

22
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,241
Did you bring it?

23
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:12,106
Keep it cool and dry.

24
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:17,651
We shouldn't contact each other

25
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:18,919
on the forums anymore.

26
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,086
Kill the trail here.

27
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,958
He's taken care of.

28
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:28,889
- Copy.
- Thanks.

29
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:32,899
Do you know how to handle that?

30
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,503
It's safe to walk around with, right?

31
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:39,672
It's stable. Wouldn't call it safe.

32
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,507
What does that mean?

33
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:42,670
That means

34
00:01:42,705 --> 00:01:44,724
don't drop it, don't shake it,

35
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:46,545
don't expose it to heat,
don't get it wet.

36
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,744
I know what I'm doing, asshole.

37
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,394
- She's pleasant.
- I can tell.

38
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,917
Reminds me of your girlfriend.

39
00:01:50,952 --> 00:01:52,438
This is what I asked you

40
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,605
to build, right?

41
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,006
I did a lot of research.

42
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,875
To your exact specifications.

43
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,444
Then we're good.

44
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,140
Long as you don't take it
through a metal detector.

45
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:05,049
Trevor, don't scare her away.

46
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:06,383
Why do you care?

47
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,853
Because I made it.

48
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:10,936
You do something stupid

49
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,311
and blow yourself up

50
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:13,758
trying to get through security...

51
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:14,791
Easy!

52
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:15,926
...It might come back on me.

53
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:19,696
You don't have to worry about that.

54
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:23,534
I should go after her.

55
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:24,568
Don't do it.

56
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:25,569
Marcy's right.

57
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:26,870
We don't want to push her too hard.

58
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:28,305
Hey, I'm not trying to push her at all,

59
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:30,774
but that's the mission
that the Director assigned us.

60
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,112
We'll just have to try again.

61
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,487
Agent MacLaren.

62
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:46,489
Congressman Bishop.

63
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:48,458
We meet again.

64
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:49,792
You met my host.

65
00:02:49,827 --> 00:02:52,629
We never actually met
because you improvised.

66
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,930
Almost got yourself
killed in the process,

67
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,446
and left me stranded,
waiting for another team.

68
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,636
Gee, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

69
00:02:59,671 --> 00:03:01,638
There was an extenuating circumstance.

70
00:03:01,673 --> 00:03:03,239
Always is, with you.

71
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:05,141
I'm amazed you're assigned
any missions at all,

72
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:06,776
let alone this one.

73
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,410
This one?

74
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:09,511
Well, I'm assuming

75
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:11,681
it's not just to drive you around.

76
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:16,198
Your mission

77
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,132
is to perform an assassination.

78
00:03:18,835 --> 00:03:20,802
Of who?

79
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:23,624
Me.

80
00:03:39,201 --> 00:03:47,307

Hi, Chloe.

82
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:12,352
It's your boyfriend!

83
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,291
Babysitting my little sister today.

84
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:19,993
Do you want to play Space Kebab?

85
00:04:20,028 --> 00:04:21,761
He's not your boyfriend, he's mine.

86
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:23,530
You can play, though,
if you don't tell Mom.

87
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,400
Want to play something else?

88
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:29,468
I can't stay,

89
00:04:29,504 --> 00:04:31,237
I just came for some drops.

90
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,106
You're burning through 'em fast.

91
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:35,207
We are.

92
00:04:35,243 --> 00:04:36,276
That's fair.

93
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:38,612
Maybe we can play a little.

94
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,642
Hi, this is David. Leave a mess...

95
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:34,601
It's open!

96
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,103
Hey!

97
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,471
Hey, hey. Let... Leave that.

98
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,174
I'm no stranger to moving furniture.

99
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,175
Yeah, I know,

100
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,313
but you shouldn't be overdoing it.

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,379
Part of my deal with Nicole

102
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,815
is to redecorate this place
while she's gone...

103
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,151
which... looks like
it could be a while, by the way.

104
00:05:55,187 --> 00:05:57,987
She's loving it in London, so yay.

105
00:05:58,023 --> 00:06:01,057
You really like it here,
huh, in this space?

106
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,892
Are you kidding?

107
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:06,329
It's the kind of place
I fantasized about living in,

108
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:07,835
until I met you.

109
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,934
You don't think I'd go
for something like this?

110
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,369
No.

111
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:15,442
Huh.

112
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:19,213
There's a unit for sale in this building.

113
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,477
Let's put in an offer.

114
00:06:21,774 --> 00:06:23,841
I'm serious!

115
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,377
But you love our old house.

116
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,190
It's a house.

117
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,988
Without you living there,
it's an empty house.

118
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:34,528
I say we downsize.

119
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:39,394
With the baby coming,
I need more space, not less.

120
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,164
- Oh.
- What?

121
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,817
Oh, come here.

122
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,869
Can you feel that?

123
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,506
I can't believe we're doing this.

124
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,542
What?

125
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,011
You said "we".

126
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,515
I got all excited.

127
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,817
I'm not ready for you to move in, Grant.

128
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,859
Well, a house doesn't get sold in a day.

129
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:07,909
And we're leaving the other one behind

130
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:09,029
either way, right?

131
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,068
I'm just...

132
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:13,934
thinking about the future.

133
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,105
Maybe I should've gone after her.

134
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,406
She comes to this cafe

135
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:27,548
almost every day, just after 10:00.

136
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:29,570
Okay, she's coming down Bellwood.

137
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:31,011
She's close.

138
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:35,982
She's stopped just outside.

139
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,726
Copy.

140
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:54,742
What are you doing here?

141
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,622
Huh?

142
00:07:56,657 --> 00:07:58,112
Are you following me?

143
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,140
How?

144
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,107
I've been here for two hours.

145
00:08:02,143 --> 00:08:03,636
Are you following me?

146
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:07,046
No. But that's my spot.

147
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:08,388
I was here first.

148
00:08:09,217 --> 00:08:10,583
Sit there.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,533
Whatever. Whatever.

150
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:29,294
Can I help you... "SandStorm"?

151
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,306
Sounds so stupid
when you say it out loud.

152
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:36,375
Yeah, it does.

153
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,219
I'm Trevor.

154
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,821
Abby.

155
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:44,236
Galston Agriculture fan?

156
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:46,618
Mm-mm. Not a fan. Definitely.

157
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:47,611
Why?

158
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:48,911
They stomp out the competition,

159
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,813
they stall unions, file nuisance claims,

160
00:08:50,848 --> 00:08:52,881
fund anti-environmental lobbyists.

161
00:08:52,917 --> 00:08:53,882
Other than that,

162
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:55,335
they're model corporate citizens.

163
00:08:55,886 --> 00:08:57,886
Okay, it's way worse than that.

164
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,760
Look at the bottom.

165
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,595
"Seed C589,

166
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:10,031
"scheduled for limited
release and production.

167
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:11,399
Patent pending."

168
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:12,700
That's all it says.

169
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:14,467
It's an experimental crop that's able

170
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:16,238
to extract more nutrients from the soil

171
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:17,739
in order to yield a larger harvest,

172
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,007
by 20% to 30%.

173
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,409
And what's wrong with that?

174
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:23,077
It's never been tested in the field.

175
00:09:23,113 --> 00:09:24,278
They don't know the limits

176
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,615
of how many nutrients C589
will pull from the soil.

177
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,984
It's not about sustainability,
it's about profit,

178
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,887
and for the sake of a few years
of record harvests,

179
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:34,055
this crop could decimate

180
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,590
all the farmland that it grows in.

181
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,793
A famine isn't just some biblical event.

182
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,028
No, I know. It happens.

183
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,632
They already have
a prototype strain ready to go.

184
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,832
When?

185
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:47,234
This week.

186
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:50,771
Well, it would have
to pass FDA regulations.

187
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:53,240
Not if Bill 939 gets passed,

188
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:56,310
which allows corporations
bypass the regulatory process

189
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,510
for standard testing.

190
00:09:59,815 --> 00:10:02,482
They want to get it to market
ahead of their competition.

191
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:04,184
How do you know all of this?

192
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,109
Not here.

193
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,148
Jeff?

194
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,084
Anyone home?

195
00:10:26,408 --> 00:10:28,408
I was pretty excited
when I got the internship.

196
00:10:28,443 --> 00:10:29,442
I thought I could take 'em down

197
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:30,843
from the inside, you know?

198
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:32,444
I wrote to our congress
I wrote to our senator,

199
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:35,347
I sent reports to the FDA
of their violations.

200
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:36,615
I even tried blackmailing

201
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,184
one of their private investors.

202
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:39,685
You go, girl!

203
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:42,287
You did not just say that.

204
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:44,957
Um, anyway, I got just moved

205
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,491
from the labs down to the basement,

206
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:49,160
so all I do now is archive old paperwork.

207
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:50,795
So, I'm not waiting around anymore.

208
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:52,197
What does that mean?

209
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,732
I still have access to the building

210
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,335
and I have what I need
to do something about it.

211
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,614
That's serious shit you're talking, Abby.

212
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:01,273
It's also a big job for one person.

213
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:03,975
I can do it.

214
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,710
You don't think I can do it?

215
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,646
You're not hearing me.

216
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,085
...And while House and Senate Democrats

217
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,820
are deeply divided on this issue,

218
00:11:15,856 --> 00:11:18,790
Congressman Ted Bishop
has taken a hard stand

219
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,057
against it.

220
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:23,093
We are gonna stop Bill 939.

221
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:24,862
We're gonna get the Senate to hear us...

222
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:27,698
that we will strike down
this destructive bill,

223
00:11:27,734 --> 00:11:29,256
and we will succeed.

224
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:34,746
This is it.

225
00:11:36,784 --> 00:11:39,918
Whoa... Holy shit.

226
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:42,020
This place is...

227
00:11:42,055 --> 00:11:43,523
- Hey.
- Hello.

228
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,018
Abby, Philip.

229
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:46,652
My hacker friend I was telling you about.

230
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:47,953
Oh. What'd he say?

231
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:50,288
Uh, you're the best,

232
00:11:50,324 --> 00:11:51,389
I can trust you,

233
00:11:51,425 --> 00:11:52,457
and you want to help.

234
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:53,792
There's so much more to me.

235
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,362
You guys live here?

236
00:11:57,397 --> 00:11:58,697
Mi Casa.

237
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,665
I still have a room at my parents' house,

238
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:01,666
but I'm here a lot.

239
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:02,801
Just the two of you?

240
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:04,103
And Poppy.

241
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:07,839
His pet turtle.

242
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,474
You do know they can carry

243
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:11,309
salmonella bacteria, right?

244
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:12,877
Noted.

245
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:14,059
Okay.

246
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:18,149
Our system is completely secure,
so go ahead and plug in.

247
00:12:21,087 --> 00:12:23,955
No shame in a little porn. I won't judge.

248
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:25,450
Rule 34.

249
00:12:25,892 --> 00:12:27,591
She's hilarious. Where'd you find her?

250
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,249
She found me.

251
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:35,066
These are the project work files

252
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,168
on C589 I managed to swipe.

253
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:38,402
I've gone through some of it,

254
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:39,803
but a lot of it's encrypted.

255
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:41,938
What's the timeline
we're working on here?

256
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:44,575
The Bill 939 vote is tomorrow.

257
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,834
Galston won't waste time.

258
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,012
The labs are always empty

259
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,581
between 11:00 and 1:00 for lunch.

260
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,683
That's our window.

261
00:12:54,453 --> 00:12:56,419
The heartbeat sounds good.

262
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:00,390
The kidney, liver, brain,
all developing very well.

263
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:02,659
This is just what we want
to see at this stage.

264
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:06,307
Now, there was one area
of concern that we saw.

265
00:13:06,342 --> 00:13:09,599
This dark spot here, behind the placenta.

266
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,425
What is it?

267
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:13,269
Too early to say for sure,

268
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:16,673
but we would be concerned
if it were a blood clot.

269
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,742
Have you experienced any spotting,

270
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:21,266
any contractions recently?

271
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,192
No.

272
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:24,547
What would a clot mean?

273
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:25,782
It could be the early signs

274
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:28,083
of a placental abruption.

275
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:30,119
But it could be nothing?

276
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:31,720
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

277
00:13:31,755 --> 00:13:33,255
There's no need for either of you

278
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,890
to worry at this time.

279
00:13:34,926 --> 00:13:36,247
But given your age and your history,

280
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,929
we're gonna... gonna keep
a close eye on this.

281
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,230
So, best to make an appointment

282
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:42,264
with my office,

283
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,333
come back and see me in two weeks. Okay?

284
00:13:44,368 --> 00:13:45,392
Yeah.

285
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:51,510
The doctor said it might not be anything.

286
00:13:51,545 --> 00:13:53,742
I know what the doctor said,

287
00:13:53,777 --> 00:13:55,388
and I've been through this before.

288
00:13:55,424 --> 00:13:57,111
That's not going to happen this time.

289
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:59,147
That's not in your power.

290
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:00,782
Oh, shit!

291
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,917
I left my phone in there.

292
00:14:02,953 --> 00:14:05,112
Wait for me in the car.
I'll be two minutes.

293
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:13,427
Thank you.

294
00:14:14,797 --> 00:14:16,797
Marcy? You got a minute?

295
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,333
I-I didn't want to have
this conversation over com.

296
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:20,434
What?

297
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,435
I need a favor.

298
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:22,436
Yeah, of course.

299
00:14:22,472 --> 00:14:23,904
One that breaks protocol.

300
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:25,506
I need you to understand

301
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,607
this happened the night

302
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:27,675
we were all under

303
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,510
the effect of the anti-toxin.

304
00:14:29,545 --> 00:14:31,078
Which you don't remember.

305
00:14:31,113 --> 00:14:32,847
We briefed you on the Helios mission,

306
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:33,881
this was the night after...

307
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,682
we were all affected.

308
00:14:35,717 --> 00:14:36,917
Okay.

309
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:38,252
Well, my wife had helped to arrange

310
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:39,819
a surprise party for me,

311
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:42,622
and I-I didn't realize
the effect the drug was having,

312
00:14:42,657 --> 00:14:44,291
I consumed too much alcohol.

313
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,592
You broke protocol 4?

314
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:50,163
And that puts her at, what?

315
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:51,598
20 weeks?

316
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:53,833
Something like that.
This is not her fault.

317
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:55,067
No, it isn't. It's yours.

318
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,353
- I know.
- What were you thinking?

319
00:14:56,388 --> 00:14:58,471
I... wasn't, obviously.

320
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,609
All right. Well,
it'd probably still be best

321
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:03,710
if you took her to a clinic.

322
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:05,412
The procedure's safe, even at this stage.

323
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,813
She's going through with it.

324
00:15:06,848 --> 00:15:07,947
It's her decision to make.

325
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:09,415
Well, talk her out of it.

326
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,844
I'm not going to do that.

327
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:13,619
No.

328
00:15:13,654 --> 00:15:14,820
We just came from the ultrasound.

329
00:15:14,855 --> 00:15:16,989
There's a problem. Placental abruption?

330
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:18,285
Yeah.

331
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,850
That's serious in any century.

332
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:23,162
Yeah, but you could improve her odds

333
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:26,031
of carrying the baby to term, right?

334
00:15:26,066 --> 00:15:28,967
There is a drug I could
technically synthesize, yes,

335
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:30,702
but you know that I can't do that.

336
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:32,833
I'm asking you to think about it.

337
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,976
I need to get back to work.

338
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,678
Hey, Marcy.

339
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:42,047
Dr. Barker.

340
00:15:42,082 --> 00:15:43,911
Uh, so is he your, uh...?

341
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:47,518
My boyfriend? No.

342
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:48,575
Excuse me.

343
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,101
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?

344
00:15:52,859 --> 00:15:53,891
Sure.

345
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:55,327
When?

346
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:57,929
How about... How about this weekend?

347
00:15:58,358 --> 00:15:59,597
How about now?

348
00:15:59,632 --> 00:16:00,865
I just got to go change.

349
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,696
Oh...

350
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,933
Okay, then.

351
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,547
I'll be giving my speech from here.

352
00:16:18,484 --> 00:16:20,951
Yeah. There's a decent vantage point.

353
00:16:20,987 --> 00:16:22,886
From which to shoot me?

354
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,222
That's why we're here.

355
00:16:26,258 --> 00:16:29,993
I was told there'll be
a distraction at 11:27 A.M.

356
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:31,194
Yeah, we're aware of that.

357
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:33,627
It's blocks away,
but the sound should carry.

358
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:36,900
Why don't you check out your spot?

359
00:16:39,657 --> 00:16:40,934
You all right?

360
00:16:41,907 --> 00:16:43,640
This is plan "B".

361
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:45,542
My original mission from the director

362
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:47,076
was a little more long-term.

363
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:49,979
Rise in the ranks of government,
maybe to high office.

364
00:16:50,015 --> 00:16:52,581
Unfortunately, my host
has a heart condition

365
00:16:52,617 --> 00:16:53,949
the Director wasn't aware of.

366
00:16:53,985 --> 00:16:56,252
You've still done great things
as a congressman,

367
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:58,154
things that your host wouldn't have done.

368
00:16:58,189 --> 00:16:59,955
Been paying attention, have you?

369
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:01,924
Felt I had a vested interest.

370
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,640
The Director has fattened me up

371
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:05,828
like a lamb being led to the slaughter.

372
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:07,730
All I've done
in the short time I've been here

373
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,598
is set myself up to become a martyr.

374
00:17:09,634 --> 00:17:11,266
We all have our part in the grand plan.

375
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,002
Yeah, yeah, it is what it is.

376
00:17:16,273 --> 00:17:17,439
Oh, I want to ask...

377
00:17:17,474 --> 00:17:19,640
that woman in the stasis field...

378
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:23,384
What was she to you?
Worth risking your life for?

379
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:25,947
Someone I care about

380
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:28,148
that was not supposed to be
on the plane that day.

381
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,352
She made it?

382
00:17:31,393 --> 00:17:33,393
Yeah. She did.

383
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:35,424
Well, that makes one of us.

384
00:17:40,263 --> 00:17:41,763
It'll be quick, right?

385
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:51,196
Thank you.

386
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:52,206
Yeah.

387
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:56,243
Um... to courage.

388
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:57,500
To courage.

389
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:05,886
So...

390
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:08,727
what drew you to health care?

391
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:10,895
God, that is an awful question

392
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:11,996
to lead with.

393
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:13,632
I am so sorry.

394
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,467
No. It's... It's fine.

395
00:18:15,502 --> 00:18:16,864
No, no. It's, uh...

396
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,608
I don't know what it is about you.

397
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:25,506
You're so...

398
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:30,320
At some point, I'm gonna need
you finish that sentence.

399
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:32,650
Every male in the entire hospital

400
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:34,681
would be jealous of me,
if they knew where I was.

401
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:36,659
This must be a really
good restaurant, then.

402
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,887
I mean, with you.

403
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,588
Obviously.

404
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:47,030
Uh, well, I got into health care

405
00:18:47,066 --> 00:18:48,399
because, in the future,

406
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:50,701
it's gonna be more important than ever.

407
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:51,969
I know.

408
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:54,505
And we're just on the cusp
of so many amazing things.

409
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,570
Mm.

410
00:18:57,538 --> 00:18:59,042
Why'd you become a doctor?

411
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,946
Um, similar reasons to you, really.

412
00:19:03,444 --> 00:19:06,149
I want to be part of
the changes that are coming.

413
00:19:06,185 --> 00:19:08,385
Think of what we're able to do now

414
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,021
that we couldn't even 10, 15 years ago.

415
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:14,057
Brain mapping, stem cell research,

416
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:15,993
robotically-assisted surgeries.

417
00:19:16,028 --> 00:19:18,227
Limitless ways to help people.

418
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,663
I mean, isn't that what it's all about?

419
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:25,268
You have a very positive
view of the future.

420
00:19:25,303 --> 00:19:26,736
Yeah, don't you?

421
00:19:28,273 --> 00:19:29,503
I do.

422
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:37,631
Here you go.

423
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,502
Thanks.

424
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:40,983
What are you writing?

425
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:42,518
It's like a mission statement.

426
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:44,586
I want people to know
why we're doing this.

427
00:19:44,622 --> 00:19:46,522
You don't think that
bombing a research lab

428
00:19:46,557 --> 00:19:47,756
makes a statement?

429
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:48,991
I don't want people to think

430
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:50,592
that I'm some radical.

431
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:51,660
There's a point to this.

432
00:19:51,695 --> 00:19:53,227
Yeah, that's why we're helping you.

433
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,865
I've been doing some reading.

434
00:19:56,901 --> 00:19:59,100
C589 is worse than you think.

435
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:00,368
How?

436
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:02,170
There are properties in
the genetic mutation of the seed

437
00:20:02,205 --> 00:20:03,138
that are monophyletic.

438
00:20:03,173 --> 00:20:04,973
Mono... what?

439
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,442
It means that the organisms descend

440
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:08,876
from the same common ancestor.

441
00:20:08,912 --> 00:20:10,312
In this case, the kudzu...

442
00:20:10,347 --> 00:20:12,880
a weed known for completely
taking over a territory.

443
00:20:12,916 --> 00:20:14,816
So if farmers start using C589...

444
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:16,884
Not only will it deplete
the soil of nutrients,

445
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,386
it will spread.

446
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:19,554
Rapidly.

447
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:22,223
With its genetic
resistance to pesticides,

448
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:24,892
C589 could become impossible to contain.

449
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,460
He's right.

450
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,630
All arable land on the planet
could be choked out in decades.

451
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:33,634
You guys really know your shit.

452
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,522
I don't really have
a life outside the Internet.

453
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:38,605
And I'm getting an "A" in biology.

454
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:26,210
No, thank you. Uh-uh.

455
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,046
Yeah, I spent many years

456
00:22:29,082 --> 00:22:31,182
very, very close to an old person

457
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:33,817
who had to fight for
every breath he took.

458
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,253
You trying to ruin this for me?

459
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,023
Nah. You're an intelligent person.

460
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,763
You can make your own decisions.

461
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,606
So what do we do now?

462
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:59,747
We can look at the stars.

463
00:23:01,014 --> 00:23:03,279
Nah, there's too much light pollution.

464
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,415
I can only see one.

465
00:23:06,153 --> 00:23:07,550
Sirius.

466
00:23:08,155 --> 00:23:09,619
Huh.

467
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:12,154
There's... There's another one.

468
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,925
That's Mars. That's a planet.

469
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,128
I defer to your astronomy expertise.

470
00:23:19,163 --> 00:23:22,131
Astrology, unfortunately.

471
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,371
My mom was into it.

472
00:23:24,768 --> 00:23:27,269
She based all her decisions,
all her relationships,

473
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:31,405
on bullshit like whether
Jupiter and Mars were aligned

474
00:23:33,576 --> 00:23:35,209
You know, most belief systems

475
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:37,045
are just a shared vocabulary

476
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,312
for people in search of meaning.

477
00:23:39,816 --> 00:23:41,149
I think maybe the important thing

478
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:43,424
is to just believe in something.

479
00:23:44,287 --> 00:23:46,154
You mean something spiritual?

480
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:47,394
Something.

481
00:23:49,425 --> 00:23:50,941
I don't believe in anything.

482
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:52,299
Yeah, you do.

483
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,569
You believe in humanity.

484
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,906
You believe that our future's at stake.

485
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:02,269
That's not spiritual.

486
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,171
Yeah, it is.

487
00:24:07,943 --> 00:24:09,643
What?

488
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,845
God, who are you?

489
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:15,683
I mean, where were you
when I was in high school?

490
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:17,484
It would've been nice to have at least

491
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,919
one interesting person to talk to.

492
00:24:19,954 --> 00:24:22,255
Well, I'm kind of an old soul.

493
00:24:23,497 --> 00:24:25,559
Yeah, no kidding.

494
00:24:29,665 --> 00:24:31,731
I like it.

495
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:38,705
I, uh... I should get back in there,

496
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,706
and see if Phil...

497
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:41,140
Yeah.

498
00:24:41,176 --> 00:24:43,843
...See if Philip needs help finishing up.

499
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:46,979
So... don't light up while I'm gone.

500
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:05,564
Good to go.

501
00:25:08,936 --> 00:25:10,869
Do you remember when Hall said,

502
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:13,947
"Don't think the future
doesn't get its hands dirty"?

503
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:22,280
I know how you feel.

504
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,049
But we knew, going into this,

505
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:27,761
that there's some parts
of history we can't change.

506
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:33,824
Some people still have to die.

507
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:37,337
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

508
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:54,578
Morning, Congressman.

509
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,780
MacLaren.

510
00:25:57,257 --> 00:25:58,448
Not much of a turnout.

511
00:25:58,484 --> 00:26:00,350
It's far more important
the event's covered

512
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:02,229
by news the outlets,
and they're all here.

513
00:26:02,755 --> 00:26:03,953
You know, for what it's worth...

514
00:26:03,989 --> 00:26:05,622
It's worth nothing.

515
00:26:05,658 --> 00:26:07,957
It's a life thrown away on the vague hope

516
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:10,727
that one man's death can turn a tide.

517
00:26:10,763 --> 00:26:13,029
I wish I'd never volunteered,

518
00:26:13,064 --> 00:26:14,397
but here I am.

519
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:16,399
You are going through with this?

520
00:26:17,402 --> 00:26:19,468
Don't worry, I'll play my part,

521
00:26:19,504 --> 00:26:21,104
however pathetic it might be.

522
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:24,140
Well, then again,
you might just change the world.

523
00:26:24,451 --> 00:26:26,475
I know the Director believes that.

524
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:41,835
Five minutes.

525
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:46,528
Bishop's ready.

526
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,300
I'm in position.

527
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,213
Me too. All set.

528
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:07,113
The device is set for 11:27,

529
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:08,911
so when you have it in place, here,

530
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:10,021
on the second floor...

531
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:11,020
I flip the engagement switch

532
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:12,455
and get the hell outta the building.

533
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:13,387
You got it.

534
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,169
All right.

535
00:27:16,492 --> 00:27:18,926
Okay. Here we go.

536
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:26,800
You good?

537
00:27:26,835 --> 00:27:28,048
Yeah.

538
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,971
Yeah.

539
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:33,821
I should go.

540
00:27:35,311 --> 00:27:37,844
We'll be right here the whole time.

541
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:40,894
See you soon.

542
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:03,248
_

543
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:26,858
Thank you.

544
00:28:26,893 --> 00:28:28,993
Thank you all for coming.

545
00:28:30,611 --> 00:28:32,331
We are gathered here

546
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:36,435
at a defining moment
in the history of our country.

547
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:41,306
Today, the senate will vote
on Bill 939...

548
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,175
...Which, at its core,

549
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,078
institutes provisions

550
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:49,114
that seek to diminish

551
00:28:49,149 --> 00:28:52,884
corporate environmental accountability.

552
00:28:54,654 --> 00:28:55,854
No way!

553
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:19,143
As your congressman,

554
00:29:19,178 --> 00:29:22,813
I stand here as a comrade in arms.

555
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:27,450
Ready to fight
against irresponsible policies

556
00:29:27,486 --> 00:29:28,919
brought forth to the senate,

557
00:29:28,954 --> 00:29:32,256
that seek to place short-term profits

558
00:29:32,291 --> 00:29:37,026
ahead of the health
and well-being of our planet.

559
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,077
I don't like it either.

560
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,334
I can't do it.

561
00:30:19,369 --> 00:30:20,301
What?

562
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:22,169
I changed my mind.
This isn't what I want.

563
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,270
Let's go.

564
00:30:23,306 --> 00:30:25,640
No. No, no. You need to trust the plan.

565
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:27,107
I don't. I'm not doing it.

566
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,442
I don't know what I was thinking.

567
00:30:28,477 --> 00:30:29,930
Abby...

568
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,713
Abby, what's changed?

569
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,015
You. Okay?

570
00:30:35,051 --> 00:30:36,783
It's you guys!

571
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:38,986
I mean, you've completely
opened my eyes to a possible...

572
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:41,322
Traveler 0115...

573
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:42,456
No! No!

574
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:44,658
...Complete the mission
in place of Abigail Paris

575
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:45,892
immediately.

576
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:49,229
Oh, shit.

577
00:30:52,835 --> 00:30:54,100
Help me.

578
00:30:57,724 --> 00:30:59,473
Why would the Director do this?

579
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:01,174
Because she was supposed to die.

580
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,643
What are you doing?

581
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:06,166
Protocol 1.

582
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,249
Bye.

583
00:31:11,753 --> 00:31:13,286
Trevor!

584
00:31:13,321 --> 00:31:14,387
Boss...

585
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:16,222
- ...We have a problem!
-  What?

586
00:31:16,258 --> 00:31:18,479
We have less than a minute,
then the bomb's gonna blow up.

587
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:21,193
We're in position, what's the problem?

588
00:31:21,228 --> 00:31:22,862
Trevor's the one taking it in.

589
00:31:22,897 --> 00:31:24,363
What?

590
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,665
Goddammit.

591
00:31:27,702 --> 00:31:29,067
Trevor, what are you doing?

592
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:30,669
Abby went Messenger...

593
00:31:30,705 --> 00:31:32,070
"Traveler 0115, complete the mission."

594
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:33,572
That's what it said.

595
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:36,708
Who cares what it said?
We'll find another way!

596
00:31:37,811 --> 00:31:38,777
Trevor!

597
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:42,680
Trevor!

598
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:45,350
Trevor!

599
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:49,021
We're down to seconds!

600
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:50,558
We don't have time!

601
00:31:50,593 --> 00:31:51,890
That's enough.

602
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:54,581
Both missions depend on this happening.

603
00:31:57,084 --> 00:31:58,797
So long, guys.

604
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,700
Boss, help me out here!

605
00:32:02,736 --> 00:32:03,968
Trevor, you know what to do.

606
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:06,026
What? No!

607
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,754
Come on!

608
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:50,871
This...

609
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:56,451
...Is a unique time in human history.

610
00:32:57,619 --> 00:32:59,719
Humanity is at a tipping point.

611
00:32:59,754 --> 00:33:02,055
This is a time in which
people of the future will ask,

612
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,190
"Did you act?

613
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:05,325
Or did you stand idly by?"

614
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,793
Where's the diversion?

615
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:09,429
Stand by. Trevor, it's time.

616
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:15,501
Boss, it won't detonate.

617
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:22,442
Where were you when it was us or them?

618
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:24,176
Because we must protect...

619
00:33:26,814 --> 00:33:28,592
He's having a heart attack.

620
00:33:28,621 --> 00:33:29,687
Call it now.

621
00:33:30,372 --> 00:33:31,817
He's dying anyway.

622
00:33:33,988 --> 00:33:35,087
We...

623
00:33:36,316 --> 00:33:37,723
must protect

624
00:33:38,218 --> 00:33:40,192
humanity's future...

625
00:33:41,162 --> 00:33:44,563
Regardless of our political beliefs.

626
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:47,999
Regardless of our religion...

627
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:51,603
The color of our skin.

628
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:53,304
Regardless

629
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,707
of personal cost.

630
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:08,619
He won't die a martyr
if he has a heart attack.

631
00:34:08,654 --> 00:34:09,620
This is the whole point.

632
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:10,788
I won't make it out.

633
00:34:10,823 --> 00:34:13,491
I got your back. Take the shot.

634
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:15,426
Now is the time for us...

635
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:21,532
There! Over there! I saw the shooter!

636
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:49,926
Get in.

637
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:55,965
Keep your head down.

638
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:06,976
Stay back!

639
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:09,211
Make some room!

640
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:16,550
He's gone.

641
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,587
What took you so long?

642
00:35:42,622 --> 00:35:45,157
We, uh, had to take care of Abby's body

643
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:46,591
before we came back.

644
00:35:48,248 --> 00:35:49,861
So what went wrong?

645
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:51,963
It was deactivated remotely.

646
00:35:52,644 --> 00:35:53,710
By me.

647
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:55,436
What?

648
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,839
I wasn't gonna let him die for nothing.

649
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:58,991
Like Abby?

650
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:00,508
It wasn't for nothing,

651
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:02,610
or we wouldn't have been
given the mission!

652
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:03,778
Galston's competition

653
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:05,780
is weeks away from their own prototype.

654
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:07,615
And come on, people.

655
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,183
Ted Bishop's assassination

656
00:36:09,218 --> 00:36:10,551
isn't gonna inspire a movement.

657
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,053
That's not for you to decide.

658
00:36:12,054 --> 00:36:13,953
Well, I did. And it's done.

659
00:36:13,988 --> 00:36:15,755
We could easily have lost one team member

660
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,922
to save another.

661
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:17,957
Without that diversion,

662
00:36:17,992 --> 00:36:20,360
Carly was completely exposed
after she fired.

663
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:21,727
You hung me out to dry.

664
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:22,628
And I see you made it.

665
00:36:22,664 --> 00:36:23,763
That's not the point, Philip!

666
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:25,531
You undermined a direct order...

667
00:36:25,566 --> 00:36:27,521
You mean like the order
the Director gave you?

668
00:36:28,722 --> 00:36:32,104
'Cause, if memory serves...
and hey, it usually does...

669
00:36:32,593 --> 00:36:34,373
you were given explicit order.

670
00:36:34,628 --> 00:36:36,642
"Kill 3468."

671
00:36:36,997 --> 00:36:39,044
But hey, maybe she just hasn't
gotten around to it.

672
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,111
This isn't funny.

673
00:36:40,147 --> 00:36:41,713
You look me in the eye and you tell me

674
00:36:41,748 --> 00:36:42,947
I am the only one on this team

675
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:44,216
who's improvised.

676
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:46,540
Tell me.

677
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,487
I am the only one

678
00:36:48,522 --> 00:36:50,210
that's broken the rules.

679
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:04,268
I can hack into Galston

680
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:07,305
and wipe all their data on C589.

681
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:10,709
We can even get another bomb in there.

682
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:14,212
But there are other ways to do this.

683
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:15,736
And if we get the mission,

684
00:37:16,616 --> 00:37:18,082
then that's what we'll do.

685
00:37:19,952 --> 00:37:21,485
It's out of our hands now.

686
00:37:21,521 --> 00:37:23,421
Protocol 5 until further notice.

687
00:37:23,456 --> 00:37:24,755
I should add,

688
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:28,449
despite my apparent
protestations to the contrary,

689
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:30,894
I'm very glad you're still alive.

690
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,763
Thank you.

691
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:34,231
You too.

692
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,220
Mac.

693
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:41,805
Get me one of her folic acid pills.

694
00:37:41,841 --> 00:37:45,609
If we're going to swap out a medication

695
00:37:45,644 --> 00:37:47,277
to prevent a miscarriage,

696
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:49,646
it'll need to look identical.

697
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,013
I didn't think you were gonna do this.

698
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:52,549
I'm a doctor.

699
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:53,816
I help people.

700
00:37:54,742 --> 00:37:56,653
I took that oath first.

701
00:37:57,411 --> 00:37:59,021
You know, technically, that's not...

702
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:01,557
Okay, then... I'm improvising.

703
00:38:03,094 --> 00:38:04,451
Thank you.

704
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,433
Hey. Can I get a ride?

705
00:38:11,602 --> 00:38:13,803
Sure. Van's out front.

706
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:15,972
Where to?

707
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:17,406
Honestly?

708
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:20,142
I don't really feel like going home.

709
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,265
I know just where that is.

710
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:25,139
Come on.

711
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:39,853
Kat?

712
00:38:46,927 --> 00:38:49,171
Kat? You home?

713
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:22,668
_

714
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:31,302
Hey. Perfect timing.

715
00:40:31,337 --> 00:40:33,066
I was just thinking about you.

716
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,276
Are you okay?

717
00:40:40,747 --> 00:40:43,748
Yeah. Long day.

718
00:40:46,225 --> 00:40:47,257
Come on.

719
00:40:47,714 --> 00:40:48,986
We'll be in my room.

720
00:40:49,022 --> 00:40:51,122
Answer the phone if Mom calls.

721
00:40:52,225 --> 00:40:53,224
Chloe?

722
00:40:53,259 --> 00:40:54,988
Okay.

723
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:29,089
Ready?

724
00:42:12,936 --> 00:42:15,236
How did you even find this place?

725
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:17,271
They're turning this old
government building

726
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:18,940
into condos soon.

727
00:42:18,976 --> 00:42:20,642
Jeff brought me here
to look at the view...

728
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:22,006
Mm.

729
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,778
Wants to buy one.

730
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:25,213
Seems like this address

731
00:42:25,248 --> 00:42:27,482
might be a little
out of your price range.

732
00:42:27,517 --> 00:42:28,949
Everything he likes

733
00:42:28,985 --> 00:42:31,219
is a little out of our price range.

734
00:42:31,254 --> 00:42:32,953
Likes to dream, that man.

735
00:42:33,454 --> 00:42:35,556
So... you two?

736
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:37,124
We three.

737
00:42:37,793 --> 00:42:38,826
That child is why we're doing this.

738
00:42:38,861 --> 00:42:39,827
That's the only reason.

739
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:41,762
Is it?

740
00:42:42,796 --> 00:42:44,364
He did stop drinking.

741
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:48,201
I got a zero-tolerance thing going.

742
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:50,771
We both love that boy, so.

743
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:53,154
Hmm.

744
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:55,208
I met a guy.

745
00:42:56,178 --> 00:42:57,411
You did?

746
00:42:58,112 --> 00:42:59,579
Doctor.

747
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,581
Well, at least you have
something in common.

748
00:43:01,616 --> 00:43:02,749
Yeah, I don't know.

749
00:43:02,784 --> 00:43:05,219
I don't really think
there's anything there.

750
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:10,957
Galston Agriculture's that way.

751
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:12,192
Trevor?

752
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:15,494
Trevor, where are you?

753
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,496
Come in!

754
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:18,598
Trevor?

755
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:20,132
Sorry, I was visiting my parents.

756
00:43:20,168 --> 00:43:22,268
Couldn't talk. You guys hear that?

757
00:43:22,703 --> 00:43:24,270
Yeah. We saw it.

758
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:25,672
Had to be Galston.

759
00:43:26,573 --> 00:43:28,809
Someone just completed our mission.

760
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:38,583
Traveler 3326,

761
00:43:38,618 --> 00:43:41,252
open memory chain 71985VX

762
00:43:41,288 --> 00:43:43,221
and store the following sequence...

763
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:46,191
Biosynthesis of the glycoproteins IgE,

764
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:48,560
IgM, IgD, IgA, IgG.

765
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:52,197
Cleave "H A" protein to form HA-1, HA-2,

766
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:54,465
and fuse with BHK 21-F.

767
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,134
Ribonucleic acid
compounds mRNA and tRNA...

768
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:06,500
