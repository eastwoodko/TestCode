1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,431
Previously, on Travelers...

2
00:00:01,433 --> 00:00:03,348
The Director gave me a new mission.

3
00:00:03,373 --> 00:00:05,808
We're going to make you
whole again, Simon.

4
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,888
One of the first things that Simon did

5
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:07,875
when he arrived

6
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,871
was create a whole new physical layer.

7
00:00:09,873 --> 00:00:11,413
Our back channel on the deep web.

8
00:00:11,415 --> 00:00:12,314
He's watching you.

9
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:13,648
Simon, what are you doing here?

10
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,425
I helped build the first one
in the future, too.

11
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:17,745
We're aware of your phone call.

12
00:00:17,747 --> 00:00:19,454
We want you to keep that appointment.

13
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,588
All you need to do is lead us there,

14
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:21,648
and we'll do the rest.

15
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:22,788
This is a message

16
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,565
for Agent Grant MacLaren.

17
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,761
He must come alone and on time,

18
00:00:26,763 --> 00:00:29,563
or I will never be heard from again.

19
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,466
Seven months ago,

20
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,786
my consciousness was sent
from the distant future

21
00:00:35,787 --> 00:00:38,286
into the body of Special
Agent Grant MacLaren

22
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,122
moments before he would,
historically, have died

23
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,526
in the line of duty.

24
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:46,697
Since then, I have assumed
his life, his work...

25
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,949
his marriage...

26
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:53,162
pretending to be a man
very different than myself.

27
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:57,838
In truth, I am Traveler 3468,

28
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,874
one of thousands of Travelers
around the world

29
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:03,380
who have come from a time
when life is all but wiped out,

30
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:06,313
to save humanity,

31
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:08,677
to change the path.

32
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,763
I know how that must sound,

33
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:14,725
especially to you, Kat...

34
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:18,145
but it's true.

35

36
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:57,321
Good afternoon, Agent MacLaren.

37
00:02:57,323 --> 00:02:58,722
Where is she?

38
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:00,591
Perrow? She's safe.

39
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,227
Though her neck might be a little tender

40
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:05,762
after having to remove the com
she allowed you to plant.

41
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:07,030
Let her go, Ingram.

42
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:08,098
Of course.

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,766
Soon as we put this to an end.

44
00:03:09,768 --> 00:03:11,967
I'd like to propose a truce.

45
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:13,912
You kidnapped

46
00:03:13,914 --> 00:03:15,739
and tortured my team,

47
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:17,440
killed Travelers all over the world.

48
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,309
I needed to know if
the Director was still after me,

49
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:21,511
and that suspicion was confirmed.

50
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,279
My mission was to die

51
00:03:23,281 --> 00:03:25,248
immediately after my arrival.

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,282
By surviving,

53
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:28,018
I committed a crime
against the Grand Plan

54
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,952
and was condemned to death.

55
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:30,786
Is that fair?

56
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:32,021
Not up to me.

57
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:33,189
No.

58
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,091
No, it's up to the Director,

59
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:37,660
who has no understanding,

60
00:03:37,662 --> 00:03:39,229
no forgiveness,

61
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:40,830
no soul,

62
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:43,466
because it is a machine.

63
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:44,967
I am tired of running.

64
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:47,036
Take a selfie, you can end it right now.

65
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:48,437
To me, the digital age

66
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,472
has created a prison around me,

67
00:03:50,474 --> 00:03:52,307
one that's been...

68
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,143
shrinking over time.

69
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:56,278
It's no way for my son to grow up.

70
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,003
Are you trying to get sympathy from me?

71
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,548
No. No.

72
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,983
No, I want your word
that you'll leave me alone

73
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:04,919
while I prepare my affairs
and face my accuser.

74
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:06,054
That's not going to go well for you.

75
00:04:06,056 --> 00:04:07,155
I have no illusions.

76
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:09,291
I know exactly what's going to happen.

77
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:10,759
I stole 16 years

78
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:12,561
that I wouldn't otherwise have had,

79
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:16,239
and in that time,
I created a precious life.

80
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:21,035
My son shouldn't have to pay
for the mistakes of his father.

81
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,507
Do I have your word?

82
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,310
You don't have my anything.

83
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:32,747
That's not actually true.

84
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,917
Grant, please help me!

85
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,178
You son of a...

86
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,191
If you freaking hurt her...

87
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:45,859
3468,

88
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,061
if you want to see your wife again,

89
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:50,230
follow this simple instruction...

90
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:52,099
Stay out of my way.

91
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,222
He showed me a video.

92
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:17,590
She's being held somewhere.

93
00:05:17,592 --> 00:05:18,758
Is she hurt?

94
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,814
I don't know, I couldn't tell.

95
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:21,528
Boss, he's faked things like this before.

96
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,995
Are you sure it was Kathryn?

97
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:24,697
Yes, and her phone
goes straight to voicemail.

98
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,664
What does he want?

99
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,266
- A truce.
-  Bullshit.

100
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:28,968
He said he's going
to show himself to the Director

101
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,102
and face punishment,

102
00:05:30,104 --> 00:05:31,304
but he wants us all to stand down

103
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,339
so he can make arrangements for his son.

104
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:34,773
Kat is his insurance.

105
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:37,409
He spent all this time
hiding and torturing Travelers,

106
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:38,644
only to turn himself in?

107
00:05:38,646 --> 00:05:39,979
I don't buy it either.

108
00:05:39,981 --> 00:05:41,913
Right now I just want Kat to be safe.

109
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,615
Philip, can you trace her phone's GPS?

110
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:44,650
I can try.

111
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:45,818
I don't think he can monitor our coms,

112
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,319
but let's be careful.

113
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:49,287
If he finds out we're looking for her...

114
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:50,389
What about Perrow?

115
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,457
He claims she's still alive,

116
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,991
but you should all check
on your loved ones

117
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:54,259
and make sure they're okay.

118
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:55,927
I'm going to Kat's place.

119
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:05,971
David's not answering.

120
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,772
Neither is Jeff.

121
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:08,773
Gary, hey!

122
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:10,641
I'm just checkin' in. How is everything?

123
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,944
Okay, let's go.

124
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:14,545
Mom's good, too?

125
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:16,146
No, I won't be home for dinner,

126
00:06:16,148 --> 00:06:17,147
and I gotta run,

127
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,916
but you guys have a good day.

128
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:47,878
Please!

129
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:53,646
I'm sorry for having
treated you this way,

130
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:55,385
but we needed to remove the device

131
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,454
as quickly as possible.

132
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:59,022
Where's my daughter?

133
00:06:59,024 --> 00:07:00,278
Home.

134
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:03,092
I don't believe you.

135
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:06,495
There's someone
supervising her as we speak.

136
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:08,631
Hello?

137
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:09,913
Ava!

138
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,068
Sweetie, are you hurt?

139
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,436
No.

140
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:15,204
There's a man here.

141
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:16,872
Are you coming home?

142
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:19,175
Soon, very soon.

143
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,215
Where are you? You said you were...

144
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:22,511
I promise you,

145
00:07:22,513 --> 00:07:23,979
Ava is going to see her mother shortly.

146
00:07:30,588 --> 00:07:34,089
There's just one more thing
I need you to do.

147
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:47,902
David?

148
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:08,356
Guys, David's gone.

149
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:10,424
So are Jeff and the baby.

150
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:12,460
Marcy, the place is destroyed.

151
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:16,063
What do we do?

152
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,965
Never thought my day
would start this way.

153
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,268
You really want to mount
an inter-agency investigation

154
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,302
into Vincent Ingram?

155
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,303
You're wasting time.

156
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:32,571
Mac, think this through.

157
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,705
He has them captive.

158
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,707
And he warned you things could get worse.

159
00:09:36,337 --> 00:09:37,809
The man said he was going
to give himself up

160
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,250
to the Director,
let's just wait this out...

161
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:40,402
And you believe him?

162
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,113
- Why would he go to the trouble of...
- He's psychotic!

163
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,683
He's spent years hunting Traveler teams,

164
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:45,984
mine included.

165
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:48,618
They'd be dead if I hadn't used
NSA resources...

166
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,788
Which is one of the reasons
why they're onto us.

167
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,890
What are you talking about?

168
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,659
A few weeks ago, I saw a report.

169
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:58,028
DOD, Homeland Security,

170
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,830
CIA, the NSA...

171
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,341
It wasn't just my host task force

172
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,400
that was suspicious.

173
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,868
We've been discovered across
all the intelligence services.

174
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,170
Probably worldwide.

175
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:08,839
Jesus.

176
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,774
They think we're some new
terrorist organization.

177
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:13,510
Cells in over a hundred countries.

178
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:16,141
They haven't acted because
they're scared as shit.

179
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,583
Our people at the NSA
and Homeland Security

180
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:21,451
are concealing us as best they can,

181
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:22,484
but at this point,

182
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:24,754
it's only a matter of time
before there are leaks.

183
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:28,425
Going after Ingram would raise
a red flag we can't afford.

184
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,026
Boss, I managed to unlock

185
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,561
multiple locations from their phones.

186
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:34,498
The last one recorded
was 3:28 p.m. yesterday,

187
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,099
all from the same place.

188
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:37,867
Send me the address.

189
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:38,935
Keep your eye on the back channels.

190
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:39,836
The rest of you, meet me there.

191
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:40,703
Mac!

192
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,379
Hello, Kathryn.

193
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,575
My name is Katrina Perrow.

194
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:22,346
I'm a psychologist.

195
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,478
Where am I?

196
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,613
I'm not permitted to tell you that.

197
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:37,825
Why are we here?

198
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:45,099
There are questions
I'm supposed to ask you,

199
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,633
but I want you to know

200
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:50,171
that I am also doing this
against my will.

201
00:11:53,482 --> 00:11:55,149
They've taken my daughter, Ava.

202
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:59,847
Now, if we just work together

203
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,881
and do what they want,

204
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:03,331
they'll let us all go.

205
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:06,167
Can we do that?

206
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:20,431
When did you first notice
changes in your husband?

207
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:27,976
It's all been for the greater good.

208
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,430
The lives lost when Van Huizen exploded

209
00:12:31,432 --> 00:12:33,699
ensured the survival of millions

210
00:12:33,701 --> 00:12:36,402
who would have died
just over a year from now.

211
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:37,870
Millions of people

212
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:40,238
who have no idea
how close they came to the end,

213
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,870
and they were saved by Travelers.

214
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:45,331
That's what we do.

215
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,047
Carly Shannon historically died

216
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:51,587
at the hand of her drunk,
abusive boyfriend.

217
00:12:52,352 --> 00:12:53,451
And now,

218
00:12:53,453 --> 00:12:54,653
instead of her child being raised

219
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,087
by a dead-beat father,

220
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,094
he is surrounded by love.

221
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,722
My love.

222
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:06,588
Jeffrey Conniker Jr.
will grow up to be a good man,

223
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:08,313
and millions of people around the world

224
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:10,738
won't suffer from the Helios catastrophe.

225
00:13:10,763 --> 00:13:12,029
So do you know what I have to say

226
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,323
about coming here,

227
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:17,196
and taking this body, and doing our work?

228
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:19,774
You're welcome.

229
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,394
Shit.

230
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,058
That's Grace's phone.

231
00:13:49,907 --> 00:13:51,907
_

232
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:05,870
Simon...

233
00:14:06,321 --> 00:14:08,455
you said it wouldn't take long.

234
00:14:08,457 --> 00:14:10,990
Yeah, but that's before
the interface overheated,

235
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:12,492
and yeah, I knew you were there,

236
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:14,094
you didn't sneak up on me.

237
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:16,729
There isn't much time.

238
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,032
I know. I have a clock in my head.

239
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,970
I need more coolant.

240
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:25,705
Did you bring it?

241
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:28,407
Everything you need is in this room.

242
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,043
Remember we're doing this for you.

243
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,145
You said "multiple uses."

244
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:34,480
Multiple transfers.

245
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,647
Yes,

246
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:38,049
and then we'll take care of you.

247
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,328
David?

248
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:49,628
David.

249
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:54,752
Sorry, I'm just...

250
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,214
never been kidnapped before.

251
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:01,873
I've been held hostage,
but that's a whole...

252
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,842
Please, just...

253
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:05,443
answer the question.

254
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:06,511
Uh, yeah.

255
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,079
I am,

256
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:11,015
was, her social worker.

257
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:13,020
How do you know about Marcy?

258
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,554
Where is she?

259
00:15:16,556 --> 00:15:17,733
She's safe.

260
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:20,724
As in...

261
00:15:20,726 --> 00:15:22,126
safely captured,

262
00:15:22,128 --> 00:15:23,823
or safe at home?

263
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,362
They didn't take her.

264
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:26,263
"They"?

265
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:28,699
The same people who took my daughter.

266
00:15:28,701 --> 00:15:30,167
I...

267
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,702
That's terrible, I'm...

268
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:35,293
Then they're after me?

269
00:15:35,641 --> 00:15:38,375
- What did I do?
- David, please...

270
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:39,709
just answer the questions

271
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,145
if you want us both to get out of here.

272
00:15:43,982 --> 00:15:44,981
Okay.

273
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:45,948
Is it true that one day

274
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,663
Marcy's cognitive abilities changed,

275
00:15:47,665 --> 00:15:49,419
and for all intents and purposes,

276
00:15:49,421 --> 00:15:51,767
she was an entirely different person?

277
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:54,353
Yeah.

278
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:56,981
Didn't that seem odd to you?

279
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:58,127
Of course it did.

280
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,261
I thought a miracle had happened,

281
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:00,693
are you kidding me?

282
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,362
How did you justify that change?

283
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:09,535
I'm pretty sure I shouldn't
be talking about this.

284
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,241
You have doctor-client privilege with me.

285
00:16:12,243 --> 00:16:13,175
You're not my doctor.

286
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:14,142
David...

287
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:15,311
She's a doctor.

288
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:16,144
Marcy Warton?

289
00:16:16,146 --> 00:16:17,746
With the FBI, undercover.

290
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:19,181
She goes on secret missions...

291
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:21,750
I've said too much.

292
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:23,485
And you believed her?

293
00:16:23,487 --> 00:16:24,620
Yeah, I met her boss.

294
00:16:24,622 --> 00:16:25,487
Grant MacLaren.

295
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:27,456
He's real. I've been to his office.

296
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:28,489
God, he's gonna kill me.

297
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:29,791
I cracked in, like, five seconds.

298
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:30,759
David...

299
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:34,262
Marcy Warton is not an FBI agent.

300
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,354
She's a traveler

301
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,800
from the future.

302
00:16:39,803 --> 00:16:40,910
A who?

303
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,704
A time traveler.

304
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:47,975
That is the stupidest thing I've ever...

305
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:49,210
She was supposed to be killed

306
00:16:49,212 --> 00:16:50,311
by a group of men

307
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,280
outside the library where she worked.

308
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:54,282
Seconds before her death,

309
00:16:54,284 --> 00:16:57,017
a consciousness was sent from the future,

310
00:16:57,019 --> 00:16:59,320
supplanting Marcy's own,

311
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:02,046
and that new traveler
survived the attack.

312
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,758
And...

313
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,159
just a few months ago,

314
00:17:05,161 --> 00:17:08,495
that consciousness
was replaced yet again.

315
00:17:08,497 --> 00:17:11,132
She called it memory loss,

316
00:17:11,134 --> 00:17:13,000
but in fact, she was...

317
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:15,101
overwritten.

318
00:17:17,584 --> 00:17:19,306
Lady...

319
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:21,908
what the hell have you been smoking?

320
00:17:47,848 --> 00:17:49,335
Hi.

321
00:17:50,748 --> 00:17:52,738
I'm sorta glad I'm not alone here.

322
00:17:58,112 --> 00:17:59,512
I'm David.

323
00:18:01,382 --> 00:18:02,715
Kathryn.

324
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,550
Kathryn...

325
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:07,327
Are they all right?

326
00:18:08,336 --> 00:18:10,588
Still on whatever drug they gave me.

327
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,952
You don't know any of them, do you?

328
00:18:15,953 --> 00:18:18,563
Uh... okay, wow. Yes.

329
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:19,431
You do?

330
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,583
Ray?

331
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:23,294
Ray, wake up!

332
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,631
He got me out of a legal jam recently.

333
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,206
It was weird...

334
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,467
Ray!

335
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:30,942
Ray! Wake up...

336
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,377
I already tried yelling.

337
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:37,849
Oh, for God's sakes.

338
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:38,717
What?

339
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,818
I know him too.

340
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,119
He's a cop.

341
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,754
He interviewed me once about Marcy.

342
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,274
Who's Marcy?

343
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:48,425
Apparently

344
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,661
a time traveler from the future.

345
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,930
She said my husband was, too.

346
00:18:52,932 --> 00:18:54,631
- Dr. Perrow?
- Yeah.

347
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,967
Yeah, but you don't a actually believe...

348
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:56,834
Of course not.

349
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:57,968
Of course not.

350
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,004
Oh, shit...

351
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,740
It's all right, you're not alone.

352
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,775
Where's my son? Where's Jeffrey?

353
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:05,942
He's just a baby...

354
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:08,178
He's not with us, I'm sorry.

355
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,114
You're MacLaren's wife.

356
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:12,182
Agent MacLaren?

357
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,649
You know who I am?

358
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:14,918
Yeah, I came to your house and told you

359
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,019
that your husband was screwing around

360
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,230
with my girl, Carly.

361
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:19,122
- Carly?
- What?

362
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:20,656
Yeah, you don't remember?

363
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:21,524
No, and I think that's something

364
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:22,458
I would remember.

365
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,027
So then why would he bring us here?

366
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:26,329
What? Why would Grant do this?

367
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,664
She's right, I don't think
this is an FBI thing.

368
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,766
How do you know

369
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:31,501
my husband works with the FBI?

370
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,981
He's Marcy's boss, isn't he?

371
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:34,383
David Mailer.

372
00:19:34,843 --> 00:19:35,976
You're the social worker creep

373
00:19:35,978 --> 00:19:38,374
that was screwin' around with
the retarded girl, Marcy.

374
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:39,341
That's a hateful word.

375
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:41,343
Okay, wait, who the fuck is Marcy?

376
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:42,612
His client!

377
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:44,179
One minute she's mentally disabled,

378
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:45,114
the next minute,

379
00:19:45,116 --> 00:19:46,015
she's whoopin' half a dozen boys

380
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,016
outside the library...

381
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:47,950
Yeah, she was under cover!

382
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:49,296
All right!

383
00:19:49,653 --> 00:19:50,719
Enough of this shit!

384
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:51,853
We talk,

385
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:53,688
or we get out of here.

386
00:19:55,893 --> 00:19:57,726
Hey!

387
00:19:57,728 --> 00:19:59,395
Whoever the hell you think you are,

388
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:01,530
you just kidnapped
a Metro police officer!

389
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:03,565
That's a class-A felony,

390
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:06,063
and I'm gonna put your ass away!
You hear me?

391
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:11,907
Do you have be so loud?

392
00:20:17,908 --> 00:20:19,314
Who the hell are you?

393
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,413
Hello. I'm... I'm David.

394
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:24,415
I'm a friend of Marcy's.

395
00:20:24,626 --> 00:20:25,719
This is Kathryn.

396
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:27,322
She's married to Agent MacLaren,

397
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:28,656
who's Marcy's boss.

398
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:29,757
This is Ray.

399
00:20:30,004 --> 00:20:31,492
He's still unconscious.

400
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:35,996
The unhappy man is Officer Conniker,

401
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:37,832
who I'm guessing is
in a relationship with Carly,

402
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,366
who's also a friend of Marcy,

403
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:42,035
all of whom may or may not
be time travelers.

404
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:43,737
And you are?

405
00:20:43,739 --> 00:20:46,974
I'm a... high school guidance counselor.

406
00:20:46,976 --> 00:20:48,909
Oh, okay. That makes perfect sense.

407
00:20:53,748 --> 00:20:55,282
Wait, no. Don't you touch me.

408
00:20:55,284 --> 00:20:56,749
No. No.

409
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:57,951
No...

410
00:20:57,953 --> 00:20:59,386
Where are you taking me?

411
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,854
Let me go!

412
00:21:00,856 --> 00:21:01,955
Let me go!

413
00:21:01,957 --> 00:21:03,423
The lady asked you to let her go...

414
00:21:04,893 --> 00:21:06,259
Back off! No!

415
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,261
Let me go!

416
00:21:11,399 --> 00:21:13,547
Who's he again?

417
00:21:14,402 --> 00:21:16,469
He's my lawyer.

418
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:33,852
Vincent's sending us something.

419
00:21:35,556 --> 00:21:37,071
Boss!

420
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:53,271
Grant, in order for me
to be released unharmed,

421
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:55,574
you must confess to...

422
00:21:55,576 --> 00:21:58,592
being a Traveler on video.

423
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:03,948
You have one hour to send it to this IP,

424
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:07,152
or they'll kill me.

425
00:22:07,637 --> 00:22:12,523
_

426
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,643
Shit, not again.

427
00:22:26,704 --> 00:22:28,150
Ray?

428
00:22:30,073 --> 00:22:31,106
David.

429
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:32,239
Yeah.

430
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:34,275
We've been kidnapped.

431
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:36,672
I know that sounds crazy, but...

432
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,508
How much do you owe Vargese?

433
00:22:41,743 --> 00:22:42,841
Vargese, anyone?

434
00:22:42,866 --> 00:22:44,500
We're not sure why we're here.

435
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,291
Does this have anything to do

436
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:47,426
with the guy in your apartment

437
00:22:47,428 --> 00:22:49,294
who, uh...

438
00:22:49,296 --> 00:22:50,461
What?

439
00:22:50,463 --> 00:22:52,496
Oh... maybe?

440
00:22:55,302 --> 00:22:57,601
What's with Mr. Big and Tall here?

441
00:22:57,603 --> 00:22:58,937
Hey, wait...

442
00:22:58,939 --> 00:23:01,822
Come on, take it easy, what the...

443
00:23:02,294 --> 00:23:03,748
Jesus.

444
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:05,910
Boss, I have to say this...

445
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:06,944
If we do this,

446
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:08,693
it goes against everything
we trained for.

447
00:23:08,718 --> 00:23:10,050
I know.

448
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:13,963
I'm sorry.

449
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:16,586
I'm not going to let my wife die.

450
00:23:16,588 --> 00:23:18,119
I feel the same way about David.

451
00:23:18,144 --> 00:23:19,743
Look, listen, listen!

452
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:23,059
I want nothing more
than to hold my son right now,

453
00:23:23,061 --> 00:23:24,494
but the mission comes first.

454
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:26,295
If you sit down at that computer

455
00:23:26,297 --> 00:23:27,663
with the intention of confessing,

456
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:28,630
you will be overwritten.

457
00:23:28,632 --> 00:23:29,999
I think I know how we can do this

458
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,226
and still maintain Protocol 1.

459
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:36,772
I got my hands on
an advanced rootkit virus

460
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:38,875
that I can plant in the code
of the video file.

461
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:39,976
Is it traceable?

462
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:40,943
Four months ago,

463
00:23:40,945 --> 00:23:42,411
it compromised the Relicus Maxicloud

464
00:23:42,413 --> 00:23:43,779
in Austria for 47 minutes,

465
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:44,713
and they still don't know who did it.

466
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:45,748
Do you?

467
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:46,982
The Faction.

468
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:49,317
I can track the video
on the back channels

469
00:23:49,319 --> 00:23:50,185
and find his location.

470
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:51,487
What if it spreads?

471
00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:52,621
I'll know where it goes,

472
00:23:52,623 --> 00:23:54,155
When the time comes, we can shut it down.

473
00:23:54,157 --> 00:23:55,257
Yeah, if the Director

474
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:56,792
lets us get that far.

475
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,296
I'm still not struck by lightning.

476
00:24:02,366 --> 00:24:03,550
Do it.

477
00:24:07,638 --> 00:24:09,337
Ready when you are.

478
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,620
Seven months ago,

479
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:28,756
my consciousness was sent
from the distant future

480
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,225
into the body of
Special Agent Grant MacLaren...

481
00:25:02,223 --> 00:25:05,858
Cooling systems at minus 270 degrees.

482
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,837
Superconductor efficiency, 99.8%.

483
00:25:14,502 --> 00:25:15,501
Simon!

484
00:25:15,503 --> 00:25:16,735
It's overheating.

485
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:17,570
Shut it down!

486
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:19,272
Simon!

487
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:32,551
It was supposed to work!

488
00:25:32,553 --> 00:25:34,119
Can you fix it?

489
00:25:34,121 --> 00:25:35,788
I told you, the device requires...

490
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,122
Simon!

491
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:38,991
Can you fix it?

492
00:25:40,327 --> 00:25:42,232
This was all for you.

493
00:25:42,696 --> 00:25:43,984
All for you.

494
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:47,362
I'm his only friend?

495
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:50,699
Man, that is tragic.

496
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:53,305
The guy travels through time,

497
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,896
becomes a junkie,

498
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:57,876
and his only friend is a lawyer
with a gambling addiction

499
00:25:57,878 --> 00:25:59,043
who uses him?

500
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:01,412
I'd like to, uh, keep us on track.

501
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:17,059
How are things at home?

502
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:30,440
Where's my son?

503
00:26:30,906 --> 00:26:32,475
Jeffrey's okay.

504
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:33,343
For now.

505
00:26:33,345 --> 00:26:34,645
What does that mean?

506
00:26:34,647 --> 00:26:36,246
It means if you and I cooperate,

507
00:26:36,248 --> 00:26:37,981
then you'll see your son,

508
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:39,182
and I'll see my daughter,

509
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:41,151
but that entirely depends on you.

510
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:44,320
There are some things about Carly

511
00:26:44,322 --> 00:26:45,838
you need to know.

512
00:26:46,797 --> 00:26:47,957
...In truth,

513
00:26:47,959 --> 00:26:49,792
I am Traveler 3468...

514
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:50,860
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mac.

515
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:51,794
We've got it under control.

516
00:26:51,796 --> 00:26:52,662
Clearly you don't.

517
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:53,796
My teammate at the NSA flagged this

518
00:26:53,798 --> 00:26:56,766
during her routine scan
for Traveler activity.

519
00:26:56,768 --> 00:26:57,833
If any other agent had found...

520
00:26:57,835 --> 00:26:59,169
Yeah, well, they didn't,

521
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:00,770
and we've taken extra precautions

522
00:27:00,772 --> 00:27:02,038
with Philip's virus.

523
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,306
Now, once we get to Vincent,
we can corrupt the video.

524
00:27:04,308 --> 00:27:05,841
I just need time to flush him out.

525
00:27:05,843 --> 00:27:06,709
The intelligence agencies

526
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:08,044
already have a target on our backs.

527
00:27:08,046 --> 00:27:11,313
Well, then, let's work together
and get ahead of it.

528
00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:14,650
Those with my specialty
are chosen as infants

529
00:27:14,652 --> 00:27:16,251
in order to develop their minds

530
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:18,996
to specifically serve
the Traveler program.

531
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:23,417
Some days I felt like an experiment,

532
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:26,587
other days like a super-human.

533
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,590
Today I'm...

534
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:37,973
The Director has kept watch
over my entire life,

535
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:41,309
knowing the outcome of every decision,

536
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:43,979
crafting my path forward,

537
00:27:45,608 --> 00:27:47,107
but here,

538
00:27:49,191 --> 00:27:51,158
I see people every day

539
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:53,183
who still believe in free will.

540
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,891
They don't know any better.

541
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:09,003
I've taken down bigger guys than you.

542
00:28:11,553 --> 00:28:14,507
Do any of you think
this could actually be true?

543
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:15,636
What?

544
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:19,512
A few months ago,

545
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:21,537
I definitely noticed changes in Grant.

546
00:28:21,562 --> 00:28:24,963
It was truly like
he was a different person.

547
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,620
What they're saying would explain...

548
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,621
Oh, please.

549
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:29,856
Like time travel is actually possible?

550
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:31,625
Okay, maybe you could send information

551
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,393
in the form of some coherent energy

552
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:34,561
across space-time,

553
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:36,095
but to calculate an exact position

554
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:38,698
would require an almost
impossible level of accuracy,

555
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,799
not to mention

556
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,801
nearly a billion zettaflops
of processing power,

557
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,870
and then to unpack it somehow,

558
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:45,204
without entropy,

559
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:48,507
in a... biological...

560
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,211
What do you do again?

561
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,946
Guidance counselor.

562
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:13,698
He knows you tampered
with MacLaren's recording.

563
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:20,471
Now each and every one of you
must record...

564
00:29:20,473 --> 00:29:22,974
your own confessions,

565
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:25,811
or we will all be killed.

566
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:30,615
Marcy, I just want to go home.

567
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:36,321
I just wanna go home.

568
00:29:38,436 --> 00:29:40,603
All right, look, look, look, listen,

569
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:42,505
we know there's only one way in

570
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:44,017
and one way out, right?

571
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:46,509
Now, there's two of them, two of us...

572
00:29:46,511 --> 00:29:48,077
Let's take 'em.

573
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:50,672
Oh, I can't wait to see this.

574
00:29:50,699 --> 00:29:52,233
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

575
00:29:52,235 --> 00:29:54,100
Next time, we jump 'em.

576
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:55,268
You take the tall one.

577
00:29:57,239 --> 00:29:58,447
Which one is the tall one?

578
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:01,641
Oh, my god.

579
00:30:01,643 --> 00:30:03,576
David... It's okay, I got you.

580
00:30:03,578 --> 00:30:05,912
I can't see out of my right eye.

581
00:30:05,914 --> 00:30:07,346
Is it okay?

582
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:09,515
It's just swollen shut.

583
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:10,416
"Just."

584
00:30:10,418 --> 00:30:12,285
Try that shit with me.

585
00:30:12,287 --> 00:30:13,786
Wait, wait, wait.

586
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:15,120
Don't.

587
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:18,758
I get it. I'm next.

588
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,092
Let's go.

589
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:30,187
My purpose is to save lives,

590
00:30:30,972 --> 00:30:33,739
whether that's a teammate in jeopardy,

591
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:35,497
or someone that's part of a mission

592
00:30:35,522 --> 00:30:36,985
ordered by the Director...

593
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,045
but I can't help but think

594
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,047
that I've put one person's life

595
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,326
in more danger than they deserve.

596
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:47,078
David...

597
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:49,415
you've suffered because of me,

598
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,834
and there's just...
there's no excuse for that.

599
00:30:53,993 --> 00:30:55,593
I cared enough to leave once.

600
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:58,586
I should have just stayed away.

601
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:05,469
I've lowered the temperature in the room.

602
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:06,904
I know it's cold.

603
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,580
It's bracing, yes.

604
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:09,798
Is it ready?

605
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,975
Almost.

606
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:12,676
It's almost done.

607
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:13,744
For 2,000 years,

608
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,714
mankind believed that God
was created in his image,

609
00:31:16,716 --> 00:31:19,717
guiding our lives, hearing our prayers...

610
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:21,251
Could you hand me the screwdriver?

611
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:23,186
But when those prayers weren't answered,

612
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:26,301
we just chalked it up to His divine will.

613
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:29,996
But then mankind created
the power to build God,

614
00:31:30,363 --> 00:31:31,895
a machine more powerful

615
00:31:31,897 --> 00:31:33,296
than any human mind could ever be...

616
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:35,031
It's just, uh, on the workbench...

617
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:36,066
The fate of our existence

618
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:37,667
just handed to an AI

619
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,435
with the ability to monitor

620
00:31:39,437 --> 00:31:41,704
each and every shifting timeline,

621
00:31:41,706 --> 00:31:44,241
while we blindly obey its orders

622
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:47,411
with the belief that salvation will come.

623
00:31:47,413 --> 00:31:48,617
It's the Phillips head...

624
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:51,114
The problem isn't the fact
that we believed in God...

625
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:52,790
"It's that we didn't
believe in ourselves."

626
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,646
Fine, I'll get it.

627
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:57,520
It's time to pull back the curtain

628
00:31:57,522 --> 00:31:58,855
and take control of the present,

629
00:31:58,857 --> 00:32:01,257
to fight for our future.

630
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,640
It's working.

631
00:32:20,912 --> 00:32:22,344
Simon...

632
00:32:23,647 --> 00:32:25,760
We can finally fix you.

633
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:32,454
A psychologist?

634
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:33,555
And you actually enjoy

635
00:32:33,557 --> 00:32:35,353
talking to people for a living?

636
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,647
When I'm not under duress.

637
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:41,067
All right, let's get it over with, then.

638
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,264
When are you from?

639
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,465
When are you from?

640
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:47,468
What is your mission?

641
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,636
What is your mission?

642
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:53,274
What is your specialty?

643
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:54,342
What is your Sp...

644
00:32:54,344 --> 00:32:55,832
All right, enough!

645
00:32:56,846 --> 00:33:01,248
You can stop pretending, Traveler 0027.

646
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:04,065
Shit.

647
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:13,026
The videos have been
disseminated to servers

648
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:15,095
in nearly every major city.

649
00:33:15,097 --> 00:33:16,930
Any luck over there?

650
00:33:16,932 --> 00:33:18,631
Locked out of everything.

651
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:20,800
You said you could control the virus.

652
00:33:20,802 --> 00:33:22,269
Yeah, well, he's pretty good, too.

653
00:33:22,271 --> 00:33:23,770
What are you saying?

654
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:26,340
What I'm saying is that
I can't corrupt the video files

655
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:28,031
that are already out there.

656
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:31,845
The world is about
to find out who we are.

657
00:33:31,847 --> 00:33:33,709
Why isn't the Director stepping in?

658
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,583
We must eventually
find a way to solve this.

659
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:39,218
If not, it had its chance
to overwrite any one of us

660
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,553
when we recorded our confession.

661
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:43,880
He's sending us a message.

662
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:46,633
UDIDs, MAC addresses,

663
00:33:47,168 --> 00:33:49,135
possible coordinates.

664
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:51,197
He's making us work for it.

665
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:52,898
He's a dead man.

666
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,200
He's a psychotic recluse!

667
00:33:54,202 --> 00:33:57,169
You're asking me
if time travel is possible.

668
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:58,337
You say that out loud again,

669
00:33:58,339 --> 00:33:59,905
and slowly.

670
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:04,307
You've seen it too.

671
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,841
We couldn't get ahead of it.

672
00:34:05,843 --> 00:34:07,009
He sent it to all the major news outlets,

673
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:08,010
intelligence agencies...

674
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:09,111
I have to believe

675
00:34:09,113 --> 00:34:10,479
that 21st-century skepticism

676
00:34:10,481 --> 00:34:12,014
is alive and well.

677
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:13,115
Yeah, for the New York Times, sure,

678
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,717
but this isn't going to be something

679
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,786
that goes away with the news cycle.

680
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,854
The information he has
fills in the pieces

681
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,022
on dozens of Traveler missions

682
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,423
the CIA could never explain.

683
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:22,657
It's only a matter of time

684
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,658
before they put it all together...

685
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,627
No, the Director
will never let that happen.

686
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:27,715
Yeah, well, here we are.

687
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:29,832
What about your wife?

688
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,134
Boss, I think I know where they are.

689
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,869
Sending you coordinates.

690
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:41,509
This is the same...

691
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:43,678
What the hell?

692
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,150
If you have any questions
about what you've just seen,

693
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,151
feel free to ask Grace.

694
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,830
She's one of them.

695
00:36:11,874 --> 00:36:13,673
Ava? Sweetie?

696
00:36:13,675 --> 00:36:14,674
Mom!

697
00:36:14,676 --> 00:36:16,743
The man said you're coming home.

698
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:18,444
I'll be home soon.

699
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:20,380
I love you.

700
00:36:20,382 --> 00:36:22,081
I love you too.

701
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,430
I wanted to say goodbye.

702
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:40,132
I'm scared.

703
00:36:40,134 --> 00:36:41,533
Don't be.

704
00:36:41,535 --> 00:36:43,735
You did it, Simon.

705
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:45,437
The device works perfectly.

706
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:51,108
Will you stay with me?

707
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:54,979
If that's what you want.

708
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:58,454
Thank you, Vincent.

709
00:36:59,794 --> 00:37:01,786
Thank you.

710
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,083
Thank you, Vincent.

711
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,493
I was part of the original test program

712
00:37:09,495 --> 00:37:11,929
for consciousness transfer...

713
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:15,066
something we had to master

714
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:19,387
before we could even dream
of traveling back through time,

715
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:21,405
and I lived in many bodies,

716
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:23,473
which makes me one of
the oldest living people

717
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:25,226
in human history...

718
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:32,567
I'll never forget what I saw
the first time I woke up...

719
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,945
my former body

720
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:39,449
with glassy eyes staring back at me.

721
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:42,658
There was no one in there anymore.

722
00:37:42,952 --> 00:37:44,694
Just a husk.

723
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,250
That image stays with me everywhere I go.

724
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,237
Traveler 5692.

725
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,376
Arrival successful.

726
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,086
All right,

727
00:38:46,088 --> 00:38:48,422
there's two of them, two of us.

728
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:50,520
It's now or never.

729
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:54,094
Cancel the plan, cancel the plan!

730
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,763
What are you... Ow!

731
00:39:01,871 --> 00:39:03,704
Where are you taking us?

732
00:39:03,706 --> 00:39:05,205
Though this news is still breaking,

733
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:07,541
we can confirm that Vincent Ingram,

734
00:39:07,543 --> 00:39:09,843
owner of one of the world's
leading securities firms,

735
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:12,445
is responsible for bringing to light

736
00:39:12,447 --> 00:39:15,348
what may be a new terrorist group

737
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:18,918
with cells positioned
throughout the world...

738
00:39:36,691 --> 00:39:38,004
Let me know when you have confirmation

739
00:39:38,006 --> 00:39:39,706
that the device has been moved.

740
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:43,609
I need to speak with my son.

741
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,662
Hello, Taylor.

742
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:05,331
Remember me?

743
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:06,599
Hi.

744
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:08,633
Did your father explain to you

745
00:40:08,635 --> 00:40:10,468
that you're going to be
living with me for a while?

746
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:13,471
Yeah, but he didn't say why.

747
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,976
So that we can be free.

748
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:26,984
I'm Dr. Katrina Perrow,

749
00:40:26,986 --> 00:40:28,620
and Vincent Ingram has been my patient

750
00:40:28,622 --> 00:40:30,442
for the last four months.

751
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:32,123
For the purposes of this recording,

752
00:40:32,125 --> 00:40:35,326
he has asked me to break
doctor-patient confidentiality.

753
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,095
This is not a subject
one can discuss openly,

754
00:40:38,097 --> 00:40:39,464
because frankly,

755
00:40:39,466 --> 00:40:42,499
it flies in the face
of 21st-century science

756
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:44,701
and what we currently perceive
to be possible,

757
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:46,761
but everything you've heard is true.

758
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:49,764
Travelers do exist.

759
00:40:50,723 --> 00:40:51,876
What do you see?

760
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:55,012
Nothin' but God's country.

761
00:40:56,848 --> 00:40:58,848
Only reason to take us
out to the middle of nowhere

762
00:40:58,850 --> 00:40:59,783
is to kill us.

763
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,153
Might as well say your prayers.

764
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:11,327
Do people still pray in the future?

765
00:41:20,338 --> 00:41:22,005
They operate covertly

766
00:41:22,007 --> 00:41:23,907
in cells made up of five members...

767
00:41:23,909 --> 00:41:25,341
...each with a specialty.

768
00:41:25,343 --> 00:41:28,211
Their missions are sent
from an advanced AI

769
00:41:28,213 --> 00:41:32,265
that continuously keeps watch
over an ever-changing timeline.

770
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:36,686
They are spies, terrorists,

771
00:41:36,688 --> 00:41:37,920
...and they will not stop

772
00:41:37,922 --> 00:41:40,889
until their Director
has achieved its primary goal,

773
00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:42,991
the Grand Plan.

774
00:41:51,268 --> 00:41:54,169
They are our wives, our husbands,

775
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:56,638
our sons, and our daughters.

776
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,210
They know our secrets,
they know our future.

777
00:42:01,678 --> 00:42:04,946
They gain our trust, our affection,

778
00:42:04,948 --> 00:42:06,716
but it's all a lie.

779
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:11,720
We must do whatever we can to stop them.

780
00:43:04,072 --> 00:43:06,373
Jesus, Kat, I was so afraid...

781
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,774
Who are you?

782
00:43:08,843 --> 00:43:09,909
David!

783
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:11,611
David!

784
00:43:11,613 --> 00:43:12,779
Don't... don't touch me.

785
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:13,646
We can get through this.

786
00:43:13,648 --> 00:43:15,247
I don't think so.

787
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:19,952
Ray, I am so sorry that
you had to go through that.

788
00:43:19,954 --> 00:43:21,086
I gotta hand it to you, kid,

789
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:23,856
you were straight with me from the start.

790
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:25,024
But let's not pretend we're friends.

791
00:43:25,026 --> 00:43:25,958
Please let me hold him.

792
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,793
Stay the hell away from my son.

793
00:43:27,795 --> 00:43:29,528
You hear me?

794
00:43:31,933 --> 00:43:34,699
Grace, are you okay?

795
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:36,768
I... I don't know.

796
00:43:44,845 --> 00:43:46,144
I'm telling you, this whole thing...

797
00:43:46,146 --> 00:43:46,978
No...

798
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,513
No, I can explain who did this.

799
00:43:48,515 --> 00:43:50,861
I don't want to hear anything from you.

800
00:43:51,552 --> 00:43:53,452
You killed my husband.

801
00:43:56,891 --> 00:44:04,904
