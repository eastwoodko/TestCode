1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:01,788
Previously on Travelers...

2
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:03,638
- Who is she?
- 0092.

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,690
She's not born
for hundreds of years from now.

4
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:06,858
A few of the patients

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,991
who have gone though
your treatment haven't...

6
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:10,899
Returned to the ward?

7
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:13,872
If you're open to it,
I could use your help.

8
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:16,931
Let go of me!

9
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,932
There was a malfunction.

10
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,134
Some information was lost
during the scan.

11
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:21,302
Don't be afraid, dear.

12
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:23,304
I only want to make you whole again.

13
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:25,306
Marcy?

14
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:26,774
Did it work this time?

15
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,542
Do you know who did this?

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,112
Grant...

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,471
Grant?

18
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:47,863
Mm-hmm?

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,996
Oh, Grant, we are not spending that much

20
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:52,297
on football tickets!

21
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:54,366
Have you seen the seats?
This is a bargain.

22
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:56,235
Do not get caught in a bidding war.

23
00:00:56,237 --> 00:00:59,138
Kat, it's for charity.
Think of the children.

24
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,514
I wonder how my steak knives are doing.

25
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:02,874
No. Grant...

26
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:04,175
Doesn't cost nothing to look.

27
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:06,277
Shit, I'm sorry, that was my fault.

28
00:01:06,279 --> 00:01:07,345
Let me get you another one.

29
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:08,594
Do you want another one, too?

30
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:10,175
I'm going to get you one.

31
00:01:10,177 --> 00:01:11,611
I'll get us all one.

32
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:16,983
My husband doesn't get out much.

33
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:18,083
Neither do I...

34
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:21,620
This is a great event.

35
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:23,021
Do you work for the hospital?

36
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:25,256
Someone my wife was very close to

37
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:26,424
received care here.

38
00:01:26,426 --> 00:01:27,659
We became supporters.

39
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:30,878
You?

40
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,831
We live nearby.

41
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,265
I donated a chair.

42
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:36,267
You endowed a new position.

43
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:40,603
Sorry. No...

44
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:43,140
I literally gave them a chair...

45
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:44,141
I'm a designer.

46
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,130
Is the chair in the auction?

47
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:48,330
It is,

48
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:51,734
and I would be very happy
to show it to you, Mr...?

49
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,735
Ingram.

50
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,736
But please call me Vincent.

51
00:01:54,738 --> 00:01:55,637
Kathryn.

52
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:58,140
Kathryn.

53
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:00,988
Um...

54
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:03,158
It doesn't have any bids, unfortunately.

55
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:05,580
Well, we'll have to see
what we can do about that.

56
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:08,050
My wife always put us down

57
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:09,238
for all...

58
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:13,620
...all... all the auction items

59
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:15,422
that could use a little support.

60
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,924
She sounds lovely.

61
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:18,771
She was. Unfortunately, she...

62
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,508
Forgive me, this work
has left me speechless.

63
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,776
It's beautiful, isn't it?

64
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:40,113
Apparently, these were created
by one of the patients.

65
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,606
Do you see a piece you like, Mr. Ingram?

66
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,123
All of them.

67
00:03:14,848 --> 00:03:16,714
I'll buy all of them.

68
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:39,231

69
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,422
Beth, where's the Petrov file?

70
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:58,083
Excuse me?

71
00:03:58,085 --> 00:03:59,225
All my material on the Petrov case...

72
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:00,421
it was right here.

73
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:02,023
It was reassigned.

74
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,024
Why?

75
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:05,059
We weren't expecting you all week.

76
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:06,227
Well, I'm here.

77
00:04:06,229 --> 00:04:08,763
I can see that,

78
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:10,798
but no one would think
worse of you if you weren't.

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,599
What is that supposed to mean?

80
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:14,634
Nothing, I was just trying to be nice.

81
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:18,200
Here.

82
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,740
Knock yourself out.

83
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,920
He keeps to himself mostly.

84
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:32,084
He has some issues with coherent thought,

85
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,085
but, hey, who doesn't?

86
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:34,553
How long have you known him?

87
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,122
About a year, year and a half?

88
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:37,056
I met him, actually,

89
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:38,553
not long after I met you...

90
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:40,259
He's a good person inside,

91
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:42,766
he just doesn't trust many people.

92
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:44,674
Paranoid? Delusional?

93
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:46,097
Oh, yeah.

94
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,966
He's on a mission from the Director.

95
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:49,267
Whatever that means.

96
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:53,338
Hey, here's some more.

97
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,904
They look new.

98
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,499
Just finished.

99
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:12,995
Hi, Marcy.

100
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:16,606
I like your hair. It looks nice.

101
00:05:46,891 --> 00:05:48,490
Philip?

102
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:51,659
Philip!

103
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:54,668
Can you change the song, please?

104
00:05:58,301 --> 00:05:59,833
I'm not your DJ, Carly.

105
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:03,271
This song is so slow.

106
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:06,540
I'm not your DJ.

107
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,075
But you're so good at it.

108
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:31,730
Thank you!

109
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:37,068
You say something?

110
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,173
Hmm?

111
00:06:38,872 --> 00:06:40,406
I like those moves.

112
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:41,907
I'll see you tonight?

113
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:49,468
Hey.

114
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:52,704
You bring it on yourself.

115
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:01,488
You know, I should have asked
if you wanted to drive,

116
00:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,414
give you the practice.

117
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,143
In a few years,

118
00:07:09,145 --> 00:07:10,914
cars're going to be driving themselves.

119
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:12,723
That's true.

120
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:16,560
You know, your mother and I

121
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,129
heard about what's going on
with your coach at school.

122
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,633
Nobody had any idea that was happening.

123
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:26,904
He seemed like a normal guy.

124
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:29,539
I hope he fries... sick bastard.

125
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:34,729
Anyway...

126
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:38,047
I want you to know
that we're here for you

127
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,450
if you ever want
to talk about it or whatever.

128
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:43,485
We'd feel awful if anything like that...

129
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,156
You don't have to worry, Gary.

130
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:46,889
It didn't happen to me.

131
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:49,452
Yeah, good.

132
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:52,060
Good.

133
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:53,094
That's what I figured.

134
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:57,832
No way, not my son.

135
00:08:14,317 --> 00:08:17,517
So strange to see these in the 21st...

136
00:08:21,723 --> 00:08:23,557
I remember him from the institution.

137
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:24,558
You do?

138
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,574
Host memories from a long time ago.

139
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:31,230
Which means he's several years
into a psychotic existence.

140
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:35,201
Hey, Simon.

141
00:08:36,886 --> 00:08:38,471
Simon, this is a friend of mine,

142
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:39,905
he has a couple questions for you.

143
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:41,385
Questions, yeah, right.

144
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:42,550
You got a gun,

145
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:43,923
I can see it.

146
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,777
I see everything.

147
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,479
And I'm on your side, Simon.

148
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:50,305
Can you tell me your traveler number?

149
00:08:55,122 --> 00:08:57,189
Do you remember
any of the rest of your team

150
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,423
or where they might be?

151
00:08:58,425 --> 00:08:59,750
I checked the area

152
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:01,459
in the shelter where he sleeps.

153
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:03,094
Seems like he's been on his own
for a while.

154
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:04,395
You want what's in my head,

155
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:07,131
but there's just so much
that you don't understand.

156
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,700
You might be surprised
what we can understand.

157
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:11,135
Okay, so you know

158
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:12,603
that an emission of Hawking radiation

159
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:15,406
concerns two mutually
entangled particles?

160
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:16,806
Who doesn't?

161
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,991
And if that particle enters a black hole,

162
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,478
it emits a finite amount of information,

163
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,778
leaving you with what?

164
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,438
A paradox!

165
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,749
The monogamy of entanglement

166
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,918
requires that the outgoing particle

167
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,653
be fixed inside two independent systems

168
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,305
at the same time!

169
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:35,324
Definitely upper echelon.

170
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,425
Probably a specialist.

171
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,360
Is that right, Simon?

172
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:39,561
Are you a specialist?

173
00:09:39,563 --> 00:09:40,629
Yes, I am,

174
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:43,399
and if you don't believe me,
ask the Director!

175
00:09:43,401 --> 00:09:45,134
- Ask the...
- Simon!

176
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:46,502
Shut up.

177
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:49,204
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

178
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,106
- Hey, Simon? Simon...
- No. I can't.

179
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,508
He's here.

180
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,955
Who's here?

181
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,210
I can't!

182
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,917
That's Vincent Ingram.

183
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,019
Yes, it is.

184
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,354
How do you know that? You never met.

185
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,758
There are no photographs.

186
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,758
He was at the institution.

187
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,026
He experimented on patients.

188
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:14,727
And you remember that?

189
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:17,976
He's 001.

190
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:20,492
What?

191
00:10:20,517 --> 00:10:21,955
- Simon.
- I didn't say anything!

192
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,407
I told you, Simon.

193
00:10:23,432 --> 00:10:24,790
- I was very clear.
- No!

194
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,971
You know what you have to do.

195
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,473
- I don't want to!
- You have to.

196
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:36,515
Now I have to take extreme measures...

197
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:39,918
Hey, whoa, whoa! He has a weapon!

198
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,252
Simon, take it easy!

199
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:42,820
Stop him!

200
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:44,155
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

201
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:50,462
You're okay. It's okay.

202
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:51,563
Lower him down.

203
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:55,031
You're okay.

204
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:58,114
What'd I miss?

205
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,448
Sorry, it's a bitch getting here.

206
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,383
Can we meet at an easier place next time?

207
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:22,725
Crazy how small they're getting, right?

208
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,188
Can I get another one next week?

209
00:11:25,163 --> 00:11:26,767
Next week?

210
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,030
I can try, but...

211
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:29,031
I gotta ask,

212
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,266
what are you doing with all this stuff?

213
00:11:30,268 --> 00:11:31,534
Don't tell him.

214
00:11:32,536 --> 00:11:33,535
What did you just say to me?

215
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:37,272
I said just what are you building?

216
00:11:37,274 --> 00:11:41,184
I mean, I just hope
it's nothing, like, illegal.

217
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,647
I'll see what I can find,
but I can't promise anything!

218
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:56,223
Simon...

219
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,559
Simon... Simon...

220
00:11:58,561 --> 00:11:59,627
Simon...

221
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:02,296
Simon... Simon...

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,899
Simon...

223
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,243
Simon!

224
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,845
What are you doing here?

225
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:22,815
You need to leave.

226
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,618
Hey.

227
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,657
Marcy said you'd be feeling
better when you woke up,

228
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,925
but there's still a few hours
left to go before dawn.

229
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,829
You can relax now, by the way.

230
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:39,164
You're safe here.

231
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,325
Oh, shit.

232
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:19,729
Oh, come on.

233
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:20,730
Grant?

234
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:23,165
Sorry. I...

235
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,266
It's 4:00 in the morning.

236
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,632
There's a sound...

237
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:26,818
What sound?

238
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,238
It's like a clicking. There's a clicking.

239
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,973
There. There.

240
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,138
The lamp's on a security timer.

241
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:45,758
Oh.

242
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,331
Now will you please come back to bed?

243
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,729
Yeah.

244
00:13:52,261 --> 00:13:55,394
Oh, no. Shh.

245
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,146
We can take turns being the strong one.

246
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:17,983
Morning. I didn't want to...

247
00:14:19,004 --> 00:14:21,238
That's a new interface.

248
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:24,043
It's cleaner.

249
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:25,567
And it's in color.

250
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,092
Color?

251
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:28,093
Do you mind if I...?

252
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,427
Sure...

253
00:14:36,436 --> 00:14:38,136
Multi-homed...

254
00:14:41,575 --> 00:14:43,007
asymmetric crypto...

255
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:52,783
Hello?

256
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,771
No...

257
00:15:50,306 --> 00:15:51,572
I surrender!

258
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:57,677
I surrender!

259
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:03,015
I surrender!

260
00:16:18,532 --> 00:16:19,898
Hi.

261
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,899
Hey.

262
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:22,334
Are you okay?

263
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:23,549
I don't know.

264
00:16:25,873 --> 00:16:27,205
Just tell me what's wrong.

265
00:16:27,207 --> 00:16:28,638
Maybe I can help.

266
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,378
All right, I'll just get right to it.

267
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:37,882
So I've been away and you've been home,

268
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:39,450
and that's totally fine.

269
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:40,566
Yeah...

270
00:16:41,755 --> 00:16:44,121
And I've been learning all this new stuff

271
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:46,323
and meeting new friends,

272
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:48,258
having these experiences,

273
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,203
and... it feels good, you know?

274
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:54,831
But then I come back home

275
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,233
and everything's the same,

276
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:58,568
but it's not.

277
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,538
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

278
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:04,940
You're breaking up with me.

279
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,642
No, I'm not...

280
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:09,978
Am I?

281
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,280
Yeah. You're growing...

282
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:12,782
into the woman you're going to become,

283
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:14,141
and that's exciting.

284
00:17:16,387 --> 00:17:17,586
You don't have to leave.

285
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:18,754
No, for sure,

286
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:20,655
it's just that you told me
it was an emergency,

287
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:23,000
so I kinda dropped
everything I was doing...

288
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:26,737
Yeah, it's an emergency
for our relationship!

289
00:17:27,163 --> 00:17:28,797
I don't even know what I want right now.

290
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,798
I understand.

291
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:33,167
Just take all the time you need.

292
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:34,636
You'll make the right decision.

293
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:45,840
Boss?

294
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,981
Go ahead.

295
00:17:50,118 --> 00:17:51,618
You're going to want to see this.

296
00:17:59,694 --> 00:18:01,115
Agent MacLaren.

297
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:02,528
David, what do you need?

298
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,529
I'm just...

299
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:04,530
Yeah, I just had some questions.

300
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:06,799
They're mostly about Marcy...

301
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:07,800
Mostly?

302
00:18:07,802 --> 00:18:09,502
All.

303
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:10,969
I'll ride down with you.

304
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,277
- I wrote them down...
- Yeah, I can see that.

305
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,981
Uh, has Marcy's situation
changed at work?

306
00:18:22,983 --> 00:18:25,183
You know I can't talk about our work.

307
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:27,285
Right, but in general,
is she under more stress?

308
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,119
Maybe she's dealing with
a difficult situation?

309
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:34,525
"Have I noticed
a sudden personality change?"

310
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:37,308
"Is she giving away
any personal possessions?"

311
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,898
This one here seems to be...
that's more of a statement...

312
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,605
What is this about?

313
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,835
Okay, well, I've had
some training in this,

314
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,003
and recently,

315
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,572
I've witnessed some signs
of self-destructive behavior.

316
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:51,362
I'm well aware
of what happened with Marcy,

317
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,208
- if that's what you're asking?
- With the tub and the ice...

318
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,878
I know how that must have looked,

319
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,912
but that wasn't self-destructive,

320
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:57,146
it was experimental.

321
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:58,247
Cutting-edge science...

322
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,248
It was extremely dangerous...

323
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,884
Look, would I have approved? No.

324
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:04,085
Do I understand why she did it?

325
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,212
Yeah, I do.

326
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:07,723
So should you.

327
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,427
Come on.

328
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:17,198
We have some new information.

329
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,099
Simon was one of the first Travelers.

330
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:20,100
004.

331
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:21,569
His mission was to set up

332
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,438
our communication infrastructure.

333
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,105
So what happened?

334
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:28,275
Schizophrenia manifests
itself later in life.

335
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:30,678
He was sent into a compromised host.

336
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,881
How well do you understand the Internet?

337
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:36,049
I'm good with languages.

338
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,353
Okay, well, broadly speaking,
there are four layers:

339
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:44,558
application, transport,
Internet, and physical.

340
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,461
One of the first things
that Simon did when he arrived

341
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:51,397
was create a whole new physical layer.

342
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,236
A dedicated backbone that piggybacks

343
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:55,064
off cell phone networks and
communications satellites.

344
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:57,235
Our back channel in the deep web.

345
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,105
Turns out our back
channel also has layers.

346
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:01,874
He's watching you.

347
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,843
Vincent's spying on us there, too.

348
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:05,578
He's using secret layers
in the back channel

349
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,046
for secure communication
and to spy on other travelers.

350
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:09,814
That's the bad news.

351
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:10,949
The good news is, now that we know,

352
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,550
we think we can use it against him

353
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:13,904
to find out where he's hiding.

354
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:16,921
Show me.

355
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,570
He presented very classically:

356
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,106
persecutory delusions,

357
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,740
fear of authority and surveillance...

358
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,776
The neuroleptics leveled him out,

359
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:31,130
and we've been working on
the other stuff ever since.

360
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,882
He believes he was sent from the future

361
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:36,889
on a mission to save the Earth.

362
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:39,652
He literally doesn't think
he's living in his own body.

363
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:49,690
The art therapy has been
a successful intervention.

364
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:52,165
As you know, he's a natural talent.

365
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:02,369
Simon, you have a visitor.

366
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:05,677
This is the man I was telling you about.

367
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,946
Hello, Simon.

368
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:09,581
It's a pleasure to meet you.

369
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:21,680
Dr. Carroll...

370
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:25,563
would it be possible

371
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:26,830
for me to speak with Simon alone?

372
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:28,098
You wouldn't be in any danger,

373
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,599
if that's what you're worried about.

374
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,401
I'd like to talk about his work

375
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,836
and I want him to feel free to open up.

376
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,863
Well, I suppose I could go
grab us some coffees.

377
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,145
Simon, will you be nice to our visitor?

378
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:45,704
Mr. Ingram is a close friend
of the institution.

379
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:52,795
You're not supposed to be here.

380
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:55,191
Simon, you heard what Dr. Carroll said.

381
00:21:55,193 --> 00:21:57,591
You were supposed to die
in the North Tower.

382
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:01,963
You know who I am.

383
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:03,639
I know that voice,

384
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,067
we searched for it for years.

385
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:07,368
Then you also know

386
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,571
that I'm important to the program, Simon.

387
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,173
I'm the very first traveler.

388
00:22:12,175 --> 00:22:13,908
The Director is not happy.

389
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,320
You were supposed to die.

390
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:16,544
Not anymore.

391
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,213
The Director gave me a new mission.

392
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:20,947
What mission?

393
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:22,849
The Director feels terrible
for what happened to you

394
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:23,850
and wants to fix it.

395
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:26,620
It sent me to help you.

396
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:31,492
We're going to make you
whole again, Simon.

397
00:22:35,863 --> 00:22:36,862
There are 16 continental switches

398
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:38,164
on the back channel,

399
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,898
but only four that handle
sub-channel traffic.

400
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,400
Simon helped me set up alerts

401
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,369
to log any suspicious network activity.

402
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:44,737
So what are we looking at?

403
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,871
This is Vincent

404
00:22:45,873 --> 00:22:47,394
communicating
with somebody late last night.

405
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:49,576
- With who?
- We don't know.

406
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,719
What does it say?

407
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:52,877
We don't know that either...

408
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,346
So where's it going?

409
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:55,647
We don't know
where it was sent or received.

410
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:57,915
Hops are encrypted along the sub-channels

411
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:59,900
as well as at both ends of the pipe.

412
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,492
Except for this one.

413
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:03,911
He's getting a call.

414
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:05,178
Well, grab it.

415
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,080
It looks like
the access point is unsecure.

416
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:08,715
We might be getting a phone number...

417
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:17,323
This isn't the last phone I sent you.

418
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:20,493
Those phones are meant for
your safety as well as mine.

419
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:21,928
I can't find that one.

420
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,929
This won't take long.

421
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:25,230
Vincent, you need

422
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:27,332
a more thorough treatment regimen,

423
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:30,669
one that at least allows for
the possibility of medication.

424
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:33,338
No. I don't need drugs,
I just need to talk!

425
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,441
We have an appointment.

426
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:35,707
And I'm calling to cancel it.

427
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:36,875
That is unacceptable.

428
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:38,109
Vincent, I'm sorry.

429
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:39,210
I can recommend...

430
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:40,846
No. I don't want to talk
with anyone else,

431
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,447
I just want to talk with you!

432
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:44,548
And I will, just as we agreed!

433
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,616
Goodbye, Vincent.

434
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:47,618
Please don't contact me again.

435
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,277
Call's over.

436
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:55,433
We got the originating number.

437
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,627
Good.

438
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:57,761
I've gotta get back to the Bureau.

439
00:23:57,763 --> 00:23:58,762
You track down that location.

440
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:00,197
Everybody else, Protocol 5.

441
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:01,898
The minute we find out
where Vincent is hiding,

442
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,266
we're going to knock down
his goddamn door.

443
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:06,936
Hey, Carly, hold up.

444
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:08,138
What?

445
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:11,574
I was thinking maybe you could stay.

446
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,142
For?

447
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:14,878
Protection?

448
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,605
I gotta pee.

449
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:21,216
I think you got this.

450
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:22,317
Bye, Philip!

451
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:27,589
Oh, Mr. Ingram?

452
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,224
Mr. Ingram.

453
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:31,259
I'm so glad I caught you.

454
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,494
I just wanted to thank you

455
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,929
for the personal interest
you've taken in Simon's care.

456
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,168
Oh, I'm happy to help.

457
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,432
But I'd also like to talk to you

458
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:40,453
about all the equipment
you've been bringing in...

459
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:41,617
Surplus electronic parts

460
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:42,837
from my various companies.

461
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,672
Most of it isn't even functional.

462
00:24:44,674 --> 00:24:47,141
Still, Simon's convinced

463
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:50,912
it will help
with his "consciousness issue".

464
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:52,436
Is that what he's saying now?

465
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:53,980
Of course, the problem is,

466
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:56,115
we have procedure to follow...

467
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:57,483
Safety and compliance,

468
00:24:57,485 --> 00:24:58,785
various approval committees...

469
00:24:58,787 --> 00:24:59,953
I understand.

470
00:24:59,955 --> 00:25:01,788
These things are expensive and take time.

471
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:07,448
Hopefully, this will address
the first problem.

472
00:25:08,476 --> 00:25:11,376
Perhaps you can help me with the second.

473
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:22,808
This is very generous.

474
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,476
Not at all.

475
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:27,144
Charity is a gift you give yourself.

476
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,111
Have a nice weekend, Doctor.

477
00:25:55,092 --> 00:25:56,315
Marcy?

478
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,664
In here!

479
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:02,920
I'm making dinner.

480
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:05,581
Really?

481
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:09,318
It's just, I've never seen you
cook before.

482
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,686
It's dinner, David,

483
00:26:10,688 --> 00:26:12,387
it's not brain surgery.

484
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:20,428
It's pasta.

485
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:21,830
Yeah.

486
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:24,713
How long's this been on?

487
00:26:24,715 --> 00:26:27,068
Not long enough
to boil off the water yet.

488
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:31,323
There's definitely still water in there.

489
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:35,529
I had a late lunch, so there's no rush.

490
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:49,800
You surprise me every time you do that.

491
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:17,482
Shit, I'm sorry.

492
00:27:17,484 --> 00:27:19,051
You're avoiding me.

493
00:27:19,053 --> 00:27:19,930
No, I'm just...

494
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:20,816
I'm...

495
00:27:20,818 --> 00:27:23,000
I see it when you look at me.

496
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:24,822
I remind you of what happened.

497
00:27:24,824 --> 00:27:26,837
And I'm not taking it personally,

498
00:27:27,226 --> 00:27:30,174
but it does convince me
that we need this.

499
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,063
Take out?

500
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:34,386
This is caponata...

501
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:37,467
this is moussaka, that's for me...

502
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:38,602
And this is Mexican,

503
00:27:38,604 --> 00:27:41,185
because there are
no Spanish places around here.

504
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:45,115
We just sold our house

505
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,734
and you have a ton
of vacation saved, so...

506
00:27:49,114 --> 00:27:50,747
Palermo,

507
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:52,348
Santorini,

508
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,349
Barcelona.

509
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:56,186
You need a break, Grant, we both do.

510
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:57,187
We take off

511
00:27:57,189 --> 00:27:58,354
for a couple of months,

512
00:27:58,356 --> 00:27:59,822
spend a ridiculous amount of money,

513
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:01,990
and hit reset on our entire life.

514
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:06,919
That would be...

515
00:28:07,732 --> 00:28:08,879
incredible.

516
00:28:11,736 --> 00:28:14,369
But you can't imagine
leaving work for that long.

517
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:15,837
I know.

518
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,516
Which is why I started thinking
about a different plan,

519
00:28:21,804 --> 00:28:23,498
one that costs just as much

520
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:24,855
and...

521
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:27,842
will definitely reset
the hell out of everything.

522
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:32,355
Adoption...

523
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,202
It's still too soon
to be diving in, I know,

524
00:28:34,204 --> 00:28:37,090
but we could at least
start talking about it.

525
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,401
It never would have occurred to me.

526
00:28:43,498 --> 00:28:45,332
Meaning what?

527
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,902
Meaning I think it's a good idea.

528
00:29:04,277 --> 00:29:05,877
Carly.

529
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:08,939
Carly!

530
00:29:12,358 --> 00:29:14,826
What... What is this?

531
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,861
Are you drunk?

532
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:18,648
Yeah, I mean, I had a couple drinks.

533
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,532
What do you want? You want me
to disrespect my boss on his birthday?

534
00:29:21,534 --> 00:29:22,733
Jeffery's sleeping,

535
00:29:22,735 --> 00:29:23,734
and you're drunk.

536
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:24,997
I'm not dealing with this right now.

537
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:27,404
Oh, you're not dealing right now?

538
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,407
How long are you going to hang
this over my head, Carly?

539
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:31,408
Come on, I been good,

540
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,910
and you know it.

541
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:36,379
Thought you were the one
that was sleeping around.

542
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:38,448
Okay. Get out.

543
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,983
I'm not going anywhere.

544
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:41,483
Don't touch me again, Jeff.

545
00:29:41,485 --> 00:29:43,152
Hey, come on. I been good. You owe me.

546
00:29:43,154 --> 00:29:44,391
Owe you?

547
00:29:47,658 --> 00:29:49,625
Am I gonna get some or what?

548
00:29:49,627 --> 00:29:50,626
Never, Jeff.

549
00:29:50,628 --> 00:29:52,695
Not now, not ever.

550
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:57,333
Stop it.

551
00:30:02,272 --> 00:30:03,939
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

552
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,512
Stay down.

553
00:30:11,514 --> 00:30:13,448
You shouldn'ta done that.

554
00:30:39,007 --> 00:30:40,106
Stay down!

555
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:42,641
I said, stay down!

556
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:49,147
Not now.

557
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,555
Not now.

558
00:30:58,525 --> 00:30:59,624
Damn it!

559
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:37,082
Morning.

560
00:31:38,085 --> 00:31:39,084
Hi.

561
00:31:41,555 --> 00:31:43,229
Were you watching me sleep?

562
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:45,557
You try looking at yourself some time,

563
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:47,125
it's hard not to.

564
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:48,759
You're ridiculous.

565
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:50,308
I am ridiculous.

566
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:55,387
I'm glad you stayed.

567
00:31:55,389 --> 00:31:57,468
This place is much cozier

568
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,651
than the place I've been staying, so.

569
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,988
Are you using me for my duvet?

570
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:10,745
I'm sorry it's taken me so long
to find my way back.

571
00:32:12,384 --> 00:32:14,082
Well, to be fair...

572
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,419
I was kinda playing hard to get.

573
00:32:21,626 --> 00:32:23,292
So help me understand.

574
00:32:24,428 --> 00:32:26,795
How could whatever it was you were doing

575
00:32:26,797 --> 00:32:28,397
make things better?

576
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,698
I mean, even if

577
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,368
you can't tell me the top-secret details.

578
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,503
Well, for example,

579
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:36,405
do you remember when we played
the "Operation" game

580
00:32:36,407 --> 00:32:38,732
and you said you were
a better doctor than me?

581
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:42,277
Because I do.

582
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:43,978
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,447
There's a lot of things that I...

584
00:32:46,449 --> 00:32:48,316
I remember...

585
00:32:48,318 --> 00:32:49,617
Most of which I can't tell you,

586
00:32:49,619 --> 00:32:50,952
but...

587
00:32:51,688 --> 00:32:53,663
I can tell you that...

588
00:32:54,324 --> 00:32:55,789
I love you.

589
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:01,296
You have no idea how happy that makes me.

590
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:05,765
Do you remember that you owe me $20?

591
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:07,762
Oh, I'll go get it.

592
00:33:07,787 --> 00:33:08,786
Oh, no. I'm kidding!

593
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:10,076
I'm kidding.

594
00:33:11,786 --> 00:33:13,433
I wonder if that pasta is ready.

595
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:16,342
Probably.

596
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:22,147
Hey, look, you survived.

597
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:23,735
Yeah.

598
00:33:24,653 --> 00:33:26,283
He started seeing
Vincent again in the night,

599
00:33:26,285 --> 00:33:29,154
but at least I got him
to start wearing pants.

600
00:33:29,156 --> 00:33:30,655
Mm-hmm.

601
00:33:30,657 --> 00:33:33,057
How about you? How are things at home?

602
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:34,292
I knew it.

603
00:33:34,294 --> 00:33:35,627
Ow!

604
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:38,062
That wasn't a random call.

605
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:39,526
What? I was up! I was bored!

606
00:33:39,528 --> 00:33:40,865
Bullshit.

607
00:33:40,867 --> 00:33:41,899
You knew something was going to happen.

608
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:43,235
How? That's impossible.

609
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:44,536
I don't know how,

610
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:45,670
but you knew.

611
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:48,593
The timing was too perfect.

612
00:33:49,308 --> 00:33:50,708
What was I going to do?

613
00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:53,170
Was I going to go to jail?

614
00:33:55,781 --> 00:33:57,185
Was I going to kill him?

615
00:33:59,818 --> 00:34:01,272
How is Jeff?

616
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:06,021
He'll live.

617
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:08,288
Probably won't even remember it.

618
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:10,263
So what are you going to do?

619
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:14,285
Hey. You got something?

620
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,694
The phone that called Vincent
was a burner:

621
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:19,778
paid for in cash,

622
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:20,935
no user info.

623
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:23,505
But I was able to use its IMEI
along with cell tower data

624
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:25,674
to find the neighborhood
that it was last used.

625
00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:27,418
Fancy part of town.

626
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,044
Right, which made this next part easier.

627
00:34:30,046 --> 00:34:31,346
Most people who live in this area

628
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:32,710
are upstanding citizens

629
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,449
who have actual names
attached to their phones.

630
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:37,600
Narrow the search to nameless devices...

631
00:34:37,787 --> 00:34:39,754
and our list drops close to zero.

632
00:34:40,232 --> 00:34:41,192
Simon and I spent the night

633
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:43,557
checking security footage
at these locations

634
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,359
and came up with our prime suspect...

635
00:34:45,361 --> 00:34:46,868
Katrina Perrow:

636
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,047
specializes in treating panic disorders,

637
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:51,799
social anxiety and agoraphobia.

638
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,033
Text me the address.

639
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:54,467
Carly, you're with me.

640
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,827
Yup.

641
00:34:56,237 --> 00:34:57,236
You've been given

642
00:34:57,238 --> 00:34:58,237
every resource to make this work!

643
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,206
We need more time.

644
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,790
We need to be operating
at the exascale, minimum.

645
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,507
- The meteor will...
- I told you... I told you...

646
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:07,414
I keep telling you...

647
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,752
the meteor doesn't happen for years.

648
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:12,117
Then we find another way, right?

649
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,127
Look, we've got the node clusters,

650
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:15,391
the math libraries,

651
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,389
we just need a qubit engine
and a field generator...

652
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:18,390
Where are we going to get that, Simon?

653
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,292
- The Director!
- Oh!

654
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:22,072
- This was a mistake.
- No...

655
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:24,403
- I've wasted so much time...
- No, we just need the plans.

656
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:25,763
No. We're finished here.

657
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:27,609
We've hurt so many people!

658
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,499
We hurt Marcy!

659
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:34,324
Just ask the Director for the materials!

660
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:37,174
Ask the Director!

661
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:14,142
Why didn't the Director help him?

662
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,311
Afterwards, I mean?

663
00:36:16,313 --> 00:36:17,784
Why'd it abandon him?

664
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,316
Probably for the same reason
it sent my consciousness...

665
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:23,985
yours, too, for that matter...

666
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:26,287
into a compromised host...

667
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:27,455
it didn't know.

668
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:29,557
No records from the institution

669
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,025
made it out of the 21st.

670
00:36:31,895 --> 00:36:33,466
Vincent covered his tracks.

671
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:36,697
I want to go home.

672
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:38,263
What's that?

673
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:41,558
Can I go home now?

674
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:45,506
Can I ask about...

675
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:46,507
No.

676
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,232
Dr. Perrow?

677
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,046
I'm Special Agent Grant MacLaren,

678
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:54,714
and this is my associate, Carly Shannon.

679
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:57,365
We'd like to speak to you
about one of your patients.

680
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:02,422
The FBI has been monitoring
Vincent Ingram for some time.

681
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:04,356
We know all about his paranoid delusions,

682
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:07,125
and, unfortunately,
he's starting to act on them.

683
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:08,327
He's hurt someone.

684
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:10,169
Yes, and we believe it will continue.

685
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,230
I didn't know.

686
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,231
I would have reported it.

687
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,499
None of that matters now.

688
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,593
We're just interested in stopping him.

689
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:19,270
Our professional relationship
deteriorated.

690
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:22,053
I just called him
to cancel an appointment.

691
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,174
We're aware of your phone call.

692
00:37:23,176 --> 00:37:24,910
We want you to keep that appointment.

693
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:26,445
What?

694
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:27,882
Why?

695
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:29,439
Ingram is in hiding.

696
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,216
You want me to keep my appointment

697
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,018
and you're going to follow me?

698
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,286
We have a device.

699
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,022
It's completely untraceable,

700
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:40,909
but it will allow us to be
in constant communication.

701
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:42,752
You mean like a wire?

702
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:44,661
Little more high-tech than that.

703
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,789
Will you help us?

704
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:51,290
I just got out of a board meeting,

705
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:53,792
and they told me that
you are withdrawing funding.

706
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:55,494
I told them that this must be
some kind of mistake.

707
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:57,029
It's not a mistake.

708
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:58,697
At least give us more time.

709
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:01,000
A more gradual reduction
of funds would allow us to...

710
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:03,035
I'm sorry, I've made my decision.

711
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:05,304
The institute has come
to rely on your generosity.

712
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:07,769
Whole programs will be shuttered.

713
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:09,812
And what about the patients?

714
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,910
A lot of them will be put
out on the street.

715
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:14,745
Well, then it's fortunate
you care so much

716
00:38:14,747 --> 00:38:16,959
and I've been able
to compensate you so well

717
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,516
over the years.

718
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:20,948
You can take my place as a benefactor.

719
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:34,998
All right.

720
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,534
This should be enough
to last you for a while.

721
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:38,735
Give us a call when you need more,

722
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:40,426
you know how to find us.

723
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:44,180
I'm glad it worked, Marcy.

724
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:46,108
Glad what worked?

725
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:51,020
The device in room 21C.

726
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:54,883
I thought you were gone forever,

727
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:55,884
but then you got better.

728
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:00,721
Maybe I can get better, too.

729
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,627
Okay. Take care of yourself, okay?

730
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:31,618
Okay, the car's approaching now.

731
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,052
Good luck.

732
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,517
All right, she's leaving the city.

733
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,019
Signal looks good.

734
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,022
Yeah. We see that, too.

735
00:40:11,024 --> 00:40:12,727
Following at a safe distance.

736
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,070
Dr. Perrow, you activated your com.

737
00:40:27,072 --> 00:40:28,071
Is everything all right?

738
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:29,072
It's fine.

739
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:30,806
We're right behind you.

740
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:32,075
All you need to do is lead us there

741
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:33,498
and we'll do the rest.

742
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,172
It's a fine day out there.

743
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:28,428
There it is.

744
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,429
GPS says she's inside.

745
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:30,763
I was going to say

746
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:31,897
we need to deactivate the cameras,

747
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:33,641
but I don't see any.

748
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:36,561
In fact, I don't even think
this barn has any power.

749
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,405
Makes sense if you want to hide
from the Director.

750
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:42,108
Why do these things
always end up in barns?

751
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,926
Philip, you got Perrow's com?

752
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:03,461
She's holding position.

753
00:43:08,257 --> 00:43:10,924
This is a message
for Agent Grant MacLaren.

754
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,995
I was acting on Agent MacLaren's behalf

755
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:18,030
in an unsanctioned operation.

756
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:21,374
I was found out

757
00:43:22,704 --> 00:43:26,045
and will be released unharmed,

758
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:30,549
along with my daughter...

759
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:35,214
As long as Agent MacLaren

760
00:43:35,216 --> 00:43:37,182
presents himself

761
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:40,319
to these coordinates
in the next two hours.

762
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:43,488
He must come alone

763
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,824
and on time...

764
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:48,559
or I will never be heard from again.

765
00:43:57,498 --> 00:44:05,537
