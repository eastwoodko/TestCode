1
00:00:00,013 --> 00:00:01,300
Previously, on Travelers...

2
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:02,365
Tell me about me.

3
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,900
I'm just trying to find
the missing pieces.

4
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:05,902
Someone like you does not happen

5
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:07,466
to someone like me.

6
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:10,782
It could be the early signs
of a placental abruption.

7
00:00:10,817 --> 00:00:12,584
- I need a favor.
- Yeah. Of course.

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,652
One that breaks protocol.

9
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:15,654
Give me one of her folic acid pills.

10
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:16,688
If we're going to swap out

11
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:18,489
a medication to prevent a miscarriage,

12
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:19,724
it'll need to look identical.

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,329
Traveler 3326, open memory chain 71985VX

14
00:00:25,365 --> 00:00:26,597
and store the following sequence...

15
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:28,466
...biosynthesis of the glycoproteins...

16
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:32,102
3326...

17
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:36,407
access memory chain 71985VX...

18
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:39,644
Write it down.

19
00:01:11,643 --> 00:01:13,710
That's all of it?

20
00:01:15,314 --> 00:01:16,479
Philip?

21
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:17,514
Is that all of it?

22
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,882
Is it error-free?

23
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:22,518
Yes.

24
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:23,984
Is it good?

25
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:26,622
It's great. Can you move?

26
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:36,365
How did you get in?

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,933
Little girl named Chloe.

28
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,167
I said I would send it to you.

29
00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:40,168
Yeah, well, something like this,

30
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:42,037
I have to see for myself.

31
00:01:42,072 --> 00:01:45,192
Those stereoisomers are going
to be difficult to reproduce.

32
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:47,199
We're gonna have to do it in batches.

33
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,592
We're leaving.

34
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:52,470
Sure. Good work, Philip.

35
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:09,713
Ohh... Oh. God.

36
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:14,092
What did we do last night?

37
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:17,009
We were going to your place.

38
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:18,455
We did.

39
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,247
We did?

40
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:26,485
This is disturbing.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,511
You hit the drops pretty hard.

42
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:29,883
Mm...

43
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,191
It's never felt like this before.

44
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,753
It'll pass.

45
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:38,016
We need to talk.

46
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,109
This has to end.

47
00:02:40,144 --> 00:02:41,734
What?

48
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,068
This.

49
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:44,369
Us.

50
00:02:46,974 --> 00:02:48,439
What?

51
00:02:48,475 --> 00:02:50,909
I got a new mission.

52
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:52,394
What mission?

53
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:53,694
Sorry, Philip.

54
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:55,295
Lightning struck.

55
00:02:56,432 --> 00:02:57,898
So "goodbye"?

56
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,914
We never see each other again?

57
00:03:02,332 --> 00:03:04,871
I... I thought we had a connection.

58
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:06,402
Right.

59
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,005
I am your connection.

60
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:10,310
That's not what I meant.

61
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:14,347
That should last you a few months,

62
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:16,449
if you use 'em
the way you're supposed to.

63
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:22,988
Jenny.

64
00:03:23,024 --> 00:03:24,824
Jenny!

65
00:03:36,993 --> 00:03:44,997
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

66
00:03:46,147 --> 00:03:47,279
Okay. It's almost over.

67
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:49,848
- Okay.
- It's 100.6.

68
00:03:50,626 --> 00:03:52,451
It's high, but manageable.

69
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:55,386
I know, I know, I know, I know.

70
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,756
So, um...

71
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,725
alternate between these two...
acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

72
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:04,828
It should manage his fever
or whatever pain he might be in.

73
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:05,885
That's it?

74
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,919
That's it.

75
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:08,587
He should be fine in a few days.

76
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:11,677
You hear that, baby?

77
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:14,314
Auntie Marcy says
you're gonna be all right.

78
00:04:14,315 --> 00:04:15,581
Ahh.

79
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:17,316
Stay for coffee?

80
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:18,584
Sure.

81
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:19,585
Okay.

82
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,328
So I'll put him down.

83
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:51,608
Philip.

84
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:56,687
You've been quiet lately.

85
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:58,949
Yeah, not much to say.

86
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:00,575
Well, some people

87
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,494
find talking about it to be therapeutic.

88
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:05,100
It has been two weeks.

89
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:09,000
You know that doesn't make
a difference for me, right?

90
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:12,302
I remember every detail
as if it just happened.

91
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:13,912
Okay, good chat. Ahem.

92
00:05:16,174 --> 00:05:17,608
Who is it?

93
00:05:17,643 --> 00:05:19,576
0115.

94
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,138
3326.

95
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,479
We were given orders to meet you.

96
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:25,747
You must be Graham.

97
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:27,811
Yeah. Come on in.

98
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:33,054
You boys hungry? I got soup on.

99
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,088
No, thank you.

100
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:35,957
Smells delicious.

101
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:37,058
You have a lovely home.

102
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:38,592
It's just temporary.

103
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:39,994
Driving up and down the state,

104
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:41,062
making hand-offs.

105
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:42,096
A long mission.

106
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,898
Well, roll out's been
longer than expected,

107
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,834
but I ain't complaining.

108
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:49,035
I got to see three eagles!

109
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:50,871
Hopefully you're done soon.

110
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:53,173
Yeah, well, your team's
one of the last on the list.

111
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:58,311
Excuse me.

112
00:05:58,347 --> 00:05:59,747
Here you go.

113
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:09,722
What a lovely couple.

114
00:06:13,996 --> 00:06:16,662
Thank you for coming
and checking him out.

115
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:18,564
I know I probably sounded crazy.

116
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,266
No, you don't sound crazy.

117
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:22,869
You had a natural maternal instinct.

118
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:26,873
I don't know about natural.

119
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,140
It's not like I'm really his mother.

120
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:29,742
Yeah, you are.

121
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,375
In every way that means something.

122
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,794
You guys have bonded.

123
00:06:35,712 --> 00:06:38,550
Who would've thought that would
happen to somebody like me?

124
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:40,185
You mean a soldier?

125
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:42,788
Maybe you've changed.

126
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,763
Maybe we all have.

127
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:47,008
I mean, I have to believe

128
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,809
that we are more than
just our consciousness.

129
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:52,103
At least, the one we came here with.

130
00:06:52,966 --> 00:06:54,356
Maybe that's...

131
00:06:54,902 --> 00:06:56,601
Maybe that's the better part of us.

132
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:58,537
It's funny, you said something like that,

133
00:06:58,572 --> 00:07:00,695
the night that you, uh...

134
00:07:01,274 --> 00:07:02,407
Um...

135
00:07:03,877 --> 00:07:04,976
What?

136
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:08,846
The night that I was reset?

137
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:10,997
What did I say?

138
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,885
Mac didn't tell you?

139
00:07:14,921 --> 00:07:17,188
Well, he said that it was
the only way to save my life.

140
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:18,856
It was.

141
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,925
So?

142
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:23,051
I really didn't have any choice then.

143
00:07:24,964 --> 00:07:26,464
You thought you did.

144
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,533
What... What does that mean?

145
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:34,472
I shouldn't have said anything.

146
00:07:34,507 --> 00:07:35,606
No, Carly.

147
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,303
We just didn't know
it was gonna happen so fast.

148
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:44,014
Are you saying that
it happened against my will?

149
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:46,316
I don't know.

150
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:49,719
We thought you had more time.

151
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:50,920
So did you.

152
00:07:50,956 --> 00:07:53,081
You said you wanted to go home,

153
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,625
because you wanted to think about it.

154
00:07:56,761 --> 00:07:59,487
What could there possibly be
to think about?

155
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,049
I mean, I'd be dead.

156
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:04,593
I know, that's what I said at the time.

157
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,670
Now I'm beginning to understand.

158
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,949
This is exactly how
it happened last time.

159
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:24,487
Kat... you've been taking
your medication,

160
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:26,255
you've done everything by the book.

161
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,289
It's gonna be all right.

162
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:29,158
Ohh, stop saying that.

163
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,695
Hi. Apologies.

164
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:35,597
The, uh, the printer was down.

165
00:08:36,634 --> 00:08:38,335
How are we?

166
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:40,019
Ahem.

167
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:44,519
Kathryn, the, uh, latest ultrasound,

168
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,307
it looks good.

169
00:08:46,343 --> 00:08:47,342
It looks really good.

170
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:49,177
The dark spot's completely gone,

171
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:50,954
which means that it was probably nothing

172
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,183
or maybe just a mistake with the scan.

173
00:08:53,883 --> 00:08:55,894
You and the baby are fine.

174
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:00,899
I'm sorry...

175
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,336
Thank you.

176
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,561
You're welcome.

177
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:07,695
Now, I want you to stick

178
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,964
to the calcium-rich foods,
the folic acid, and...

179
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:10,998
'Kay.

180
00:09:11,034 --> 00:09:12,366
I'll see you in a few weeks.

181
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:13,400
Okay.

182
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:14,468
Thanks.

183
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:16,136
'Kay.

184
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,042
Thank you.

185
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,617
Hoo...

186
00:09:36,491 --> 00:09:37,789
What was in the package?

187
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:39,270
An antiviral.

188
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:40,961
Historically,

189
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:42,729
this is the beginning
of a minor flu outbreak

190
00:09:42,764 --> 00:09:44,864
that kills 70,000 people worldwide.

191
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,232
That does not sound "minor" to me.

192
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:47,300
Percentage-wise.

193
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:49,069
We're not wired to think
in "billions" of people.

194
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:50,971
Over a few months, an antigenic shift

195
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:52,871
allows the virus to mutate,

196
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:54,540
infecting more of the population.

197
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:57,543
Eventually, the C.D.C.
and W.H.O. get it under control.

198
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:00,379
Must be why they provided
a broad-spectrum antiviral.

199
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:01,658
This will inhibit

200
00:10:01,694 --> 00:10:03,716
the development of each of its mutations.

201
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:05,684
Our mission is to save
three of the people

202
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,220
who, historically, don't make it.

203
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:09,121
Are there any more?

204
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:11,023
Jeffrey's already been
through the worst of it.

205
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,092
You need to protect yourself.

206
00:10:13,127 --> 00:10:15,728
Couldn't we have gotten the pill version?

207
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:17,429
These are the host candidates?

208
00:10:17,464 --> 00:10:19,098
Jordan Lam, Annie Kapoor,

209
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,187
and Brittney Palmer.

210
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:23,736
Personal trainer, a flight attendant,

211
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:25,537
a travel blogger.

212
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,439
Prime hosts that must
have spread the virus.

213
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:29,907
Well, let's make sure
that doesn't happen.

214
00:11:01,174 --> 00:11:03,374
Are you gonna do the whole class?

215
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:07,545
Just waiting for the right opportunity.

216
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:10,548
Hi, Brittney.

217
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,082
I'll be doing your vaccinations today.

218
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:14,324
- Okay.
- You can take a seat.

219
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,208
That's it.

220
00:12:13,244 --> 00:12:14,543
Have fun in Europe.

221
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,278
Thanks.

222
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,086
Mein Asthma.

223
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,336
_

224
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:52,546
Oh!

225
00:12:52,582 --> 00:12:55,115
God. I was stung by a freakin' bee.

226
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:56,817
Me too. I think.

227
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:58,218
Are you allergic?

228
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,853
No. I'm not.

229
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:00,888
Good.

230
00:13:10,232 --> 00:13:11,698
...As reports are increasing

231
00:13:11,733 --> 00:13:13,132
of an unknown flu strain

232
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,901
that seems to be rapidly spreading

233
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:16,603
throughout the country.

234
00:13:16,638 --> 00:13:18,055
The World Health Organization

235
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,574
describes the condition
as "atypical influenza"

236
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,543
and confirms five cases
have been reported...

237
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:25,412
- ...In the Pacific Northwest.
- It's starting.

238
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:28,380
Good. Nice work, everybody.

239
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,716
Protocol five until further notice.

240
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,823
We need to talk.

241
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:42,125
Hello, Miss Day.

242
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,127
When's the last time
you heard from the Director?

243
00:13:44,162 --> 00:13:45,402
The school board director?

244
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:46,402
What are you talking about?

245
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:47,736
Hey, you're worried about them?

246
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:49,572
Please! There's literally
nothing going on

247
00:13:49,607 --> 00:13:50,906
inside their tiny brains.

248
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,374
The girls are thinking about
their insipid friendships

249
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:54,484
and the boys are imagining them naked.

250
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:57,212
What do you want?

251
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:58,380
Have you heard

252
00:13:58,415 --> 00:13:59,915
from the Director?

253
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:01,783
We've had missions.

254
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:05,220
Well, why haven't I heard anything?

255
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:06,488
I don't know. Maybe because

256
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:08,023
you jumped here without permission?

257
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:09,992
Or maybe because you don't have a team?

258
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:11,259
Maybe I can join your team.

259
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:12,927
I could be your computer expert.

260
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:14,196
Nah, we already have a computer expert.

261
00:14:14,231 --> 00:14:15,830
I could be your vastly-more-capable

262
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:16,865
computer expert.

263
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,899
Doesn't work like that.

264
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:19,300
Well, it should! I'm getting bored!

265
00:14:20,937 --> 00:14:22,720
You gonna finish that?

266
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:29,844
Mm! Fake chicken.

267
00:14:34,117 --> 00:14:36,417
Mm!

268
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:40,221
Hey have you seen my, uh, my work jacket?

269
00:14:40,256 --> 00:14:42,623
You were supposed to take Jeffrey today.

270
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:44,791
I know that, but I just got called in.

271
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:45,792
There's this big bug going around.

272
00:14:45,828 --> 00:14:46,953
So?

273
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,197
So I'm going to work.

274
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,434
What'd I say?

275
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,629
It's what you didn't say.

276
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,873
"Hey, Carly.

277
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:01,975
"I know I was supposed
to take Jeffrey today,

278
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:04,110
but something came up. Can you help?"

279
00:15:04,146 --> 00:15:06,246
Well, why do I have to say all of that?

280
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:07,614
You're his mother.

281
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,416
And you're his father.

282
00:15:09,767 --> 00:15:11,751
We said we were
going to do this together.

283
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,353
Equal partners, remember?

284
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,259
Carly Shannon,

285
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,561
would you please help me out

286
00:15:21,596 --> 00:15:24,097
by taking our gorgeous son
to the babysitter's house

287
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,365
so that I can go to work

288
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,267
as an underpaid,
underappreciated, beat cop

289
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,969
one more day?

290
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:34,959
Fine,

291
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:37,342
but you're doing pick-ups
for the rest of the week.

292
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:38,629
Absolutely.

293
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:41,716
And your jacket's
on the hook by the door.

294
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,782
Thank you.

295
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:46,452
See you, little man.

296
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,088
I'll see you, uh, see you tonight.

297
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,826
Hey. You want your ducky?

298
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:58,297
Yeah, you do.

299
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,298
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

300
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,278
Oh? Where are you taking him?

301
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,539
Hello?

302
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:30,264
3185. Has your team taken the antiviral?

303
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,729
- Yeah.
- 'Kay, let us in.

304
00:16:39,238 --> 00:16:41,204
Oof!

305
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:48,991
Where's Marcy?

306
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,820
Hi. This David Mailer.
Please leave a message.

307
00:17:32,923 --> 00:17:36,258
Hi, David. Um, it's me, Marcy.

308
00:17:36,294 --> 00:17:37,393
Just wondering

309
00:17:37,428 --> 00:17:39,928
if you wanted to maybe
get together to talk.

310
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:41,429
Marcy, you there?

311
00:17:41,464 --> 00:17:46,301
Uh, so, if you'd like to,
just give me a call back.

312
00:17:46,336 --> 00:17:47,402
Okay. Bye.

313
00:17:47,437 --> 00:17:48,603
Marcy?

314
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:53,332
Yeah, Philip, go ahead.

315
00:17:53,367 --> 00:17:54,710
We need you at Ops.

316
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:56,711
Boyd showed up with one of her teammates.

317
00:17:56,746 --> 00:17:58,346
What's happening?

318
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,447
I don't know.

319
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,649
She said it's some kind
of viral infection.

320
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,218
There's growing concern

321
00:18:03,253 --> 00:18:04,885
for an outbreak of a new flu strain

322
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:08,256
that has infected a number
of people in recent days.

323
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,258
While much is still unknown
about this virus...

324
00:18:10,293 --> 00:18:11,625
Hey, Sarge.

325
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,061
I never got my assignment.

326
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:15,395
Connicker, what are you doing here?

327
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:16,496
I'm filling in.

328
00:18:16,532 --> 00:18:17,898
Yeah, right.

329
00:18:17,934 --> 00:18:20,467
This flu is kicking us around.
You get your shot yet?

330
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:21,602
No. Not yet.

331
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:22,989
Well, you better get on it.

332
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:25,139
You covering McAllister or Boyd?

333
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:26,273
McAllister.

334
00:18:26,308 --> 00:18:28,174
Hospital.

335
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,413
Top authorities are expressing concern

336
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,519
over the intensity of the symptoms

337
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:42,256
and the speed in which the virus
seems to be spreading.

338
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:43,990
So it presents like classic flu...

339
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,825
fever, sore throat, headache.

340
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:46,993
Yeah, but it's not the flu.

341
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:48,094
He received

342
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,522
the same broad-spectrum
antiviral we all did.

343
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:51,631
Okay, a virus that's not the flu...

344
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,199
Um...

345
00:18:53,235 --> 00:18:55,802
Meningitis? West Nile?

346
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:57,036
I checked those.

347
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:58,337
I checked them all, actually.

348
00:18:58,373 --> 00:18:59,622
There's no match.

349
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,377
Well...

350
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:06,445
...Okay, well, if it's a virus,
we can identify which one it is.

351
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:07,946
I've checked every gene sequence

352
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:09,348
for every virus in the 21st

353
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:11,216
and every century after that.

354
00:19:11,252 --> 00:19:13,469
Are you saying that it's a new pathogen?

355
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:16,322
Yeah. Unknown in this time or in ours.

356
00:19:16,357 --> 00:19:17,389
How is that even possible?

357
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,941
"O, my love, my wife!"

358
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,711
"Death...

359
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,646
"Death sucked the honey of thy breath,

360
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:45,082
have no power yet upon thy beauty."

361
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,786
Seriously, you guys?

362
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,554
How old are you?

363
00:19:50,047 --> 00:19:51,722
Go ahead, Trevor.

364
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:54,093
"...Upon thy beauty.

365
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,721
"Thou art not conquered.

366
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,529
"Beauty's ensign yet

367
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,232
"is crimson in thy lips
and in thy cheeks,

368
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,034
and death's pale flag..."

369
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,369
Trevor? You there?

370
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,064
...Aye.

371
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,873
Good. Okay, okay.

372
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:10,907
Take it from, um...

373
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:11,908
You in class?

374
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,076
Mm-hmm.

375
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,646
"Dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair?"

376
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,880
Okay, you need to leave.

377
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,682
You might be infected
with a dangerous pathogen.

378
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:19,683
Keep your distance

379
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,184
from other people and get outside.

380
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,686
- What's happening?
- Just go now.

381
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,721
We're skipping to the last section.

382
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,757
One final embrace,
one last kiss, and then...

383
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:29,392
Go, now. MacLaren's waiting for you.

384
00:20:29,427 --> 00:20:30,961
I got to go.

385
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,428
You don't have to kiss, just read.

386
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:35,431
Don't! Don't touch me!

387
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,467
I'm sorry... I got to go.

388
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,810
Hardly even looks like a virus.

389
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,512
No, you kind of expect something

390
00:20:49,547 --> 00:20:51,180
pleomorphic.

391
00:20:51,215 --> 00:20:53,416
Spherical capsid... radial symmetry.

392
00:20:53,451 --> 00:20:55,217
That's what's infected us?

393
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:58,620
That's what we're trying to determine.

394
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:01,423
Oh, good! I need blood from both of you.

395
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,557
What do you call it?

396
00:21:02,593 --> 00:21:04,326
Mm. We haven't got that far yet.

397
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:05,394
Boyd's viral count

398
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,762
is up in the hundreds of thousand,

399
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:08,797
her teammate's up over a million.

400
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,465
Here. Seems to be tied

401
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,467
to the antiviral mission somehow.

402
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,202
We got it two weeks before you did.

403
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:16,304
Heath's immune system
was already compromised.

404
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,006
I had to remove one of his lungs

405
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,174
after a mission blew up
near the beginning.

406
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,343
His antibodies
are showing no cross-reactivity,

407
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:23,745
his body just keeps amplifying it.

408
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:25,514
So how do we get it under control?

409
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,249
Heath!

410
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:29,850
- Little help?
- Guys!

411
00:21:30,887 --> 00:21:31,986
We need to sedate him!

412
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:33,754
Keep holding him down!

413
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:41,296
I can't get a BP.

414
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:42,763
There's no pulse.

415
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,933
One, two... three, four...

416
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:46,567
five, six, seven,

417
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:48,869
eight, nine, ten.

418
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:51,204
11, 12, 13, 14,

419
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,441
15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

420
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:55,008
Stop CPR.

421
00:21:56,746 --> 00:22:00,180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

422
00:22:00,215 --> 00:22:02,215
eight, nine, ten.

423
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:04,017
- One, two, three, four...
- He's gone. Marcy.

424
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,218
- ...Five, six...
- Marcy!

425
00:22:05,254 --> 00:22:06,976
He's gone.

426
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:26,052
I'm sorry.

427
00:22:27,188 --> 00:22:29,088
Come on.

428
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:32,489
Let's get you off your feet.

429
00:22:32,524 --> 00:22:34,224
You need some rest.

430
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:36,326
I think it's a little late for that.

431
00:22:45,384 --> 00:22:46,783
So...

432
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:48,601
how's it looking?

433
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:52,909
We're all infected, aren't we?

434
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
Not all.

435
00:23:00,318 --> 00:23:02,518
You, Philip, and Carly have it.

436
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:05,421
You and I somehow rejected the virus.

437
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:06,689
What?

438
00:23:06,724 --> 00:23:07,956
Each of your blood samples

439
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:10,926
has a viral load between 500
and 1,000 copies per milliliter.

440
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:12,261
Ours is zero.

441
00:23:12,296 --> 00:23:13,729
What about antibodies?

442
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:14,730
Trace amounts.

443
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:15,764
Somehow, we're immune.

444
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,233
How is that possible?

445
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:19,335
It's hard to say,
without running more tests.

446
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,903
So, if we're immune,
can't you create a blood serum?

447
00:23:21,939 --> 00:23:24,439
We'll try, but we might be
running out of time.

448
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:25,673
If this started with the mission,

449
00:23:25,709 --> 00:23:26,742
we can't be the only ones.

450
00:23:26,777 --> 00:23:27,876
Check the deep web

451
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:29,510
for any other teams
reporting the same symptoms.

452
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:30,946
If it's transmitted

453
00:23:30,981 --> 00:23:33,048
through air particles and fomites,

454
00:23:33,083 --> 00:23:34,249
that means there's a good chance

455
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:36,785
you've infected everyone
you've come into contact with.

456
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,098
Are you sure?

457
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:40,421
Outside of an immunity,

458
00:23:40,457 --> 00:23:41,589
we're predicting an infection rate

459
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,090
of over 40%.

460
00:23:43,126 --> 00:23:44,292
40?

461
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:46,060
Call everyone
you've come into contact with.

462
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:47,629
Tell them to stay inside.

463
00:23:48,357 --> 00:23:50,298
Boss, you're gonna want to see this.

464
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:51,766
Traveler teams from around the world

465
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,301
are reporting the same sickness.

466
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:58,205
They've been
transmitting it this whole time.

467
00:23:58,241 --> 00:23:59,940
If I get you more of the antiviral,

468
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:01,041
can you analyze it?

469
00:24:01,077 --> 00:24:02,609
See what went wrong?

470
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:05,112
Possibly, but I'm running low
on ethidium bromide.

471
00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:06,446
It's a controlled substance,

472
00:24:06,482 --> 00:24:08,382
it's not something you can get
on short notice.

473
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:09,383
What about your hospital?

474
00:24:09,418 --> 00:24:11,285
Yeah, the lab should have some.

475
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,486
I'll text you a name.

476
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:16,556
You two, track down the team
that handed off the vials,

477
00:24:16,592 --> 00:24:17,624
I'll go to the hospital.

478
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,493
I've got to get my son
from the babysitter's.

479
00:24:19,528 --> 00:24:21,395
Carly! You're infected.

480
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,298
The best thing that you can do
for Jeffrey right now

481
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,632
is stay away.

482
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:36,976
Hi, David. Um, it's me, Marcy.

483
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:38,144
I was just wondering

484
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,079
if you wanted to maybe
get together to talk.

485
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:43,949
Uh, so, if you'd like to,
just give me a call back.

486
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,150
Okay, bye.

487
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,159
David?

488
00:24:54,195 --> 00:24:56,261
Marce! Hey!
Sorry, I just got your message.

489
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:57,563
I was out riding.

490
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,064
Uh, I'd love to meet up.

491
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,632
Um, where are you right now?

492
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:01,632
I'm at home.

493
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:02,834
Okay, don't leave.

494
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:03,935
You coming over?

495
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,970
No, David. Uh...

496
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:09,007
A dangerous flu is spreading.

497
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:11,242
Like SARS?

498
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,877
Worse than that.

499
00:25:13,643 --> 00:25:14,746
W...

500
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,915
Wait. What-what? Where are you?

501
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,316
I'm-I'm safe. Just...

502
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,251
Why do I get more worried
every time you say that?

503
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:22,853
David, you don't
need to worry about me, okay?

504
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,090
Well, I do, I worry about you.

505
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:28,826
And I worry about my clients,
most of whom...

506
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,595
don't have a home to stay inside of.

507
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,729
David...

508
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:32,830
Just stay home.

509
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,397
I've seen how bad this can get.

510
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:35,432
Marce, I'm sorry.

511
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,234
Thank you for telling me,
but I've got to go.

512
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,395
David!

513
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,088
...And reporting
a wide range of symptoms,

514
00:25:50,124 --> 00:25:51,514
from common flu ailments,

515
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,583
like headache, fatigue, and fever,

516
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,119
to, in rare cases, more extreme symptoms,

517
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:59,122
including redness
and bleeding around the eyes.

518
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:00,223
At this point,

519
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,225
health authorities
are advising the public

520
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:04,261
to stay home if they don't feel...

521
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:08,430
Where are you headed?

522
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,431
Home.

523
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,733
When you get there, stay there.

524
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,301
There seems to be a bad flu going around.

525
00:26:12,336 --> 00:26:14,070
And tell everyone you know, all right?

526
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,371
Sure thing.

527
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:25,492
...Officials have been able to determine

528
00:26:25,527 --> 00:26:28,083
that despite being referred to
by most as "the flu,"

529
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:31,253
this is not actually
a new strain of influenza

530
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,722
but rather a new virus completely.

531
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,624
The origins of the virus...

532
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,510
Mac, where are you?

533
00:26:44,545 --> 00:26:45,736
It's all-hands over here.

534
00:26:45,772 --> 00:26:47,064
I know, listen.

535
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:49,204
Did you receive an antiviral
in the last two weeks?

536
00:26:49,239 --> 00:26:51,006
Yeah, I had to save some hosts.

537
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,473
Any of your team sick?

538
00:26:53,677 --> 00:26:55,310
Yeah. Three of us. Why?

539
00:26:55,345 --> 00:26:56,811
We've seen Traveler reports

540
00:26:56,846 --> 00:26:58,112
this is happening all over the world,

541
00:26:58,147 --> 00:27:00,147
and I think
we are the primary transmitters.

542
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:01,148
Shit!

543
00:27:01,184 --> 00:27:02,249
I have my team tracking down

544
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:04,251
the antiviral, to run some tests.

545
00:27:04,287 --> 00:27:06,086
All right, well, let me know how it goes.

546
00:27:06,122 --> 00:27:07,988
In the meantime,
the CDC's setting up shelters,

547
00:27:08,024 --> 00:27:09,424
Wakefield wants us

548
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:11,025
to meet up with the National Guard.

549
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,527
I'll text you the address.

550
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:13,560
Look, I'm on my way to the hospital.

551
00:27:13,595 --> 00:27:14,962
I'll have to meet you in 30.

552
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:16,285
All right.

553
00:28:13,454 --> 00:28:15,010
Graham?

554
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:22,017
Graham! It's Trevor.

555
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:36,674
I'll go check the back.

556
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:38,075
Sure.

557
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:12,511
Hi. Sorry. Can you tell me
who's in charge here?

558
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:13,545
What do you need?

559
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:16,515
He's got a bad fever, a headache.

560
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:18,050
He needs to see a doctor.

561
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:19,351
Well, he's not gonna get one here.

562
00:29:19,387 --> 00:29:21,953
The E.R.'s been in overflow for an hour,

563
00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:23,822
and people with the flu
are being sent home.

564
00:29:23,857 --> 00:29:25,303
He'll be better off at home.

565
00:29:25,338 --> 00:29:27,958
Excuse me. Excuse me.

566
00:29:29,704 --> 00:29:31,437
Nurse, he doesn't have a home.

567
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:32,705
Well, he's better off anywhere but here.

568
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:33,873
You his family?

569
00:29:33,908 --> 00:29:35,141
Case worker.

570
00:29:35,176 --> 00:29:37,443
How many people
are you caring for right now?

571
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,944
Uh...

572
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,780
Officially or unofficially?

573
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:43,715
Wait here.

574
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:50,355
Oh. Here. Um...

575
00:29:50,391 --> 00:29:51,490
It's not much,

576
00:29:51,525 --> 00:29:52,825
but it's better than nothing.

577
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,826
Thank you.

578
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,227
Yeah. Be sure to keep one for yourself.

579
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:56,461
Thank you, that's very kind.

580
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:57,446
Take care!

581
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,869
Agent MacLaren!

582
00:30:04,905 --> 00:30:05,904
David.

583
00:30:05,939 --> 00:30:07,306
Is Marcy here?

584
00:30:07,341 --> 00:30:08,373
No.

585
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:09,841
Maybe you could pass
along a message for me?

586
00:30:09,876 --> 00:30:11,075
Could you ask her

587
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,883
to come by the shelter a little later?

588
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:14,028
These guys are in rough shape.

589
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,079
I'll pass it along,

590
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,981
but her hands are pretty full right now.

591
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:18,416
Yeah, I bet.

592
00:30:18,451 --> 00:30:20,318
Excuse me! Why are you taking her?

593
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:21,319
We were here first!

594
00:30:21,354 --> 00:30:23,251
I'm not taking anyone, sir, relax.

595
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,223
We've got a kid here!

596
00:30:25,682 --> 00:30:27,491
How bad is it?

597
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:32,230
Okay. I'll let you get to it, then.

598
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:35,165
Remember to ask Marcy...

599
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,767
I will. Good luck.

600
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,937
Yeah, you too.

601
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:52,615
Pupils are sluggish.

602
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,417
Intracranial pressure?

603
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,685
I mean, that would explain

604
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,587
the headaches and the seizures.

605
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,688
We could try mannitol,

606
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:00,557
or skip straight to a cerebral shunt.

607
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,125
Great.

608
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:03,760
Isn't that your specialty?

609
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,095
Funny.

610
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,464
We got company.

611
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,465
Let me in!

612
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,400
I can't, we're sick.

613
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,268
So am I! Let me in!

614
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,576
One of those teenage
petri dishes got me sick.

615
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,214
What's all this?

616
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,782
We got a mission to save people

617
00:31:26,817 --> 00:31:28,284
who were gonna die from the flu,

618
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,253
but the Director's antiviral didn't work.

619
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,653
That's impossible.

620
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,659
There's also an outbreak
in Shanghai and Berlin.

621
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,964
Hey, Mac, you there?

622
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,366
Go ahead.

623
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,035
We found the delivery team,
but no antiviral.

624
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,336
The supply was cleared out

625
00:31:48,372 --> 00:31:50,406
and the team had been assassinated.

626
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,740
What?

627
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,576
There was no sign
of struggle or forced entry.

628
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,444
Wh... Are you thinking inside job?

629
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:58,346
It wouldn't be the first time
a team turned on each other.

630
00:31:58,382 --> 00:31:59,859
Right?

631
00:32:01,351 --> 00:32:03,184
None of this makes any sense.

632
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,954
Okay. I'll see you back at Ops.

633
00:32:15,164 --> 00:32:16,864
She doesn't look good.

634
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,087
Not helpful.

635
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,869
Hold this above her head.

636
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:23,003
None of this matters

637
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,338
in the long run.

638
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:25,807
The Director will fix it!

639
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:27,679
Didn't fix him.

640
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,381
Traveler incoming.

641
00:32:38,604 --> 00:32:40,154
Ah! Told ya!

642
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:41,288
Here comes the cavalry.

643
00:32:41,324 --> 00:32:43,457
It's good to see you. We need help.

644
00:32:43,492 --> 00:32:44,658
Everyone does.

645
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:46,292
All right, let's have the cure.
We can chat later.

646
00:32:46,328 --> 00:32:48,027
- There is no cure.
- What?

647
00:32:48,063 --> 00:32:49,228
Of course there is.
We're from the future.

648
00:32:49,264 --> 00:32:51,063
Several teams are working on a viricide,

649
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:52,532
but so far without success.

650
00:32:52,568 --> 00:32:54,901
I'm here to talk to Philip.

651
00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:57,003
I want to go over the antiviral
data one more time.

652
00:32:57,038 --> 00:32:58,338
Maybe we made a mistake.

653
00:32:59,085 --> 00:33:01,140
I don't know what you're talking about.

654
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,376
The formula you wrote on the wall.

655
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:04,377
It allowed us

656
00:33:04,412 --> 00:33:05,979
to synthesize the antiviral.

657
00:33:06,343 --> 00:33:08,314
It's right here, look.

658
00:33:11,219 --> 00:33:13,186
I remember this...

659
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,154
but I don't remember writing it down.

660
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,823
How do you not remember?
That's impossible.

661
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:19,157
When did this happen?

662
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:20,726
About two weeks ago.

663
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:22,361
You were with 4514.

664
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:23,395
Jenny.

665
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,429
What?

666
00:33:24,465 --> 00:33:25,931
I had a headache

667
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:28,033
and she told me it was from the drops.

668
00:33:28,068 --> 00:33:30,102
She must have given you
a memory inhibitor.

669
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:32,337
Oh, God.

670
00:33:32,373 --> 00:33:34,039
Please tell me what is going on.

671
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:35,173
Just go get her!

672
00:33:39,946 --> 00:33:41,222
Hello?

673
00:33:41,257 --> 00:33:43,081
Hey. It's me.

674
00:33:43,117 --> 00:33:44,716
What's happening? Are you all right?

675
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:46,618
Grant, have you seen the news?

676
00:33:46,653 --> 00:33:49,021
No. I-I haven't.
Are you sure you're okay?

677
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:51,022
Yeah, just feeling a bit...

678
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,290
shaky, I don't know.

679
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:56,193
Probably just the news making me crazy.

680
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:57,629
Can you come home?

681
00:33:57,664 --> 00:33:59,764
Not... Not yet. Look, just lie down, Kat.

682
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:01,799
And stay inside! Okay?

683
00:34:01,835 --> 00:34:03,374
Okay. What about you?

684
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,354
Are you gonna be all ri...

685
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:05,603
Well, look at this.

686
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:06,604
Grant?

687
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,140
I gotta go.
I just... uh, I'll call you soon.

688
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:11,075
Come to get a look at
some real police work?

689
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,476
Carly's worried about your son.

690
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:14,078
You need to pick him up and go home.

691
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:15,179
You running errands for her now?

692
00:34:15,214 --> 00:34:16,813
I thought that shit was over between you.

693
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:18,649
It was never what you thought it was.

694
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:19,650
And, right now,

695
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:21,152
this is about something bigger than that.

696
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:24,655
You need to pick up your son,
Jeff, and go home.

697
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:34,031
Hey, it's Marcy. We need you back at Ops.

698
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:36,232
We know the source of the antiviral.

699
00:34:36,268 --> 00:34:38,835
A Traveler named Jenny. Philip knows her.

700
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,729
I'm on my way.

701
00:34:53,618 --> 00:34:55,485
Mac, it's been over an hour.

702
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,752
What are you doing here?

703
00:34:56,788 --> 00:34:58,487
We're late. We gotta meet
with the National Guard.

704
00:34:58,522 --> 00:35:00,355
You'll have to do it without me.

705
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:01,824
We need you.

706
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:03,926
My team comes first.

707
00:35:19,843 --> 00:35:21,243
Jenny!

708
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:23,480
Chloe!

709
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:25,414
Jenny!

710
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,949
Jenny?

711
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,222
Oh, no... no, no, no, no, no.

712
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,124
No, no. Jenny. Hey, hey.

713
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:38,026
Hey! Hey.

714
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:41,663
No. No, no. No. No.

715
00:35:48,704 --> 00:35:51,172
Are you sure about this?

716
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:52,926
Do I have any other choice?

717
00:35:56,393 --> 00:35:57,545
All right.

718
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,057
Her vitals are good.

719
00:36:04,604 --> 00:36:07,187
Ohh...

720
00:36:30,445 --> 00:36:31,881
She's stable.

721
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:35,134
Okay.

722
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:55,655
Carly?

723
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:02,829
Shit.

724
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:08,354
Shh. It's okay. I got you.

725
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:10,556
I got you, I got you. It's okay.

726
00:37:11,225 --> 00:37:13,158
It's okay. It's okay.

727
00:37:16,897 --> 00:37:18,230
Shh-shh-shh. It's okay.

728
00:37:18,265 --> 00:37:20,665
It's okay. It's okay.

729
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,982
You know, when I was a kid,

730
00:37:38,017 --> 00:37:40,017
my mom would make me chicken soup

731
00:37:40,053 --> 00:37:41,253
when I was sick.

732
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:44,922
Not exactly sure
why it was always chicken soup.

733
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,591
Vera!

734
00:37:46,627 --> 00:37:48,392
Hey, I was trying to reach you.

735
00:37:48,427 --> 00:37:49,526
I said no doctors!

736
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:51,428
- Okay. No, no...
- Don't touch me.

737
00:37:51,464 --> 00:37:53,064
No. It's David. See?

738
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:54,665
Hi!

739
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,267
You okay?

740
00:37:56,302 --> 00:37:57,268
Yeah.

741
00:37:57,303 --> 00:37:58,302
All right. You got something to eat?

742
00:37:58,337 --> 00:37:59,336
- Yeah.
- Okay.

743
00:37:59,372 --> 00:38:01,438
I'll be around if you need me. Okay?

744
00:38:08,147 --> 00:38:09,680
It's okay, big man.

745
00:38:09,715 --> 00:38:11,181
We're gonna get through this.

746
00:38:12,718 --> 00:38:14,126
We're gonna be fine.

747
00:38:14,162 --> 00:38:15,719
You're a fighter.

748
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:17,220
Just like Mama.

749
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:19,590
Just like Daddy.

750
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:22,192
It's okay.

751
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:24,694
It's okay. It's okay.

752
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,886
Hey.

753
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:37,407
I sense that doctor you sent me to

754
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:39,275
likes you a lot.

755
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:40,276
Where's...

756
00:38:40,312 --> 00:38:41,577
what's-her-name, Jenny?

757
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:42,945
They should be back any minute.

758
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,180
Philip knows her how?

759
00:38:45,684 --> 00:38:48,150
Ah. Okay. So what's this?

760
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:49,452
I'm trying to determine

761
00:38:49,487 --> 00:38:51,721
the pathogen's reproduction number,

762
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:54,790
based on hospital databases,
social media updates...

763
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:57,110
Here. Let me show you something.

764
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:04,633
An "r-nought" indicates

765
00:39:04,668 --> 00:39:05,901
how infectious a virus is

766
00:39:05,937 --> 00:39:08,014
by determining the rate
of secondary infection.

767
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:09,280
If it's less than one,

768
00:39:09,664 --> 00:39:12,016
the virus will quickly die out.

769
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,385
If it's greater than one...

770
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,988
We have an epidemic.

771
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,256
So what are we dealing with?

772
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:19,524
Let's put it into perspective...

773
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,302
Influenza has an r-nought of one...

774
00:39:23,497 --> 00:39:27,031
...With an incubation period of two days.

775
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:29,399
Chances are you'd infect
one person in a day,

776
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:32,061
then they'd go on
to infect one more, and so on.

777
00:39:32,672 --> 00:39:36,140
This virus has an r-nought
of at least two,

778
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,542
with an incubation period...

779
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,945
of 10 days.

780
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,246
14 days ago,

781
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:44,748
10 traveler teams across the world

782
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,617
transmitted the virus.

783
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:49,253
So that is...

784
00:39:54,193 --> 00:39:55,325
Potentially

785
00:39:55,361 --> 00:39:58,495
150 people on day one...

786
00:39:58,531 --> 00:40:00,596
330...

787
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,056
...on day two.

788
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:04,668
I don't like where this is going.

789
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,970
So, based on the data I pulled

790
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,172
from people already reporting symptoms,

791
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:12,842
and factoring in
the exponential growth rate...

792
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:19,014
Over 4 million people

793
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,949
are currently infected.

794
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,785
Tomorrow, it'll be almost 10.

795
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,420
Most of them aren't showing symptoms yet,

796
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:25,588
but they will soon.

797
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,590
So how long before
the death rate starts to climb?

798
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,791
A couple of days.

799
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,194
I need some help out here!

800
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,698
Clear off that table.

801
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,969
Marcy, I don't know if she's breathing.

802
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,340
She took pills.

803
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:45,307
Get her up here.

804
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:49,644
I got a weak pulse!

805
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,978
What'd she take?

806
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:53,081
Oxycodone.

807
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,851
Hey. Hey, hey, Jenny.

808
00:40:56,886 --> 00:40:58,353
I'm here. I'm here.

809
00:40:58,388 --> 00:40:59,454
You're at Ops. You're safe.

810
00:40:59,489 --> 00:41:01,122
You're safe.

811
00:41:01,157 --> 00:41:02,757
You overdosed. I found you in your room.

812
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:05,694
Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

813
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:08,029
The mission is in trouble.

814
00:41:08,064 --> 00:41:09,230
No, Philip.

815
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,333
The mission went exactly as planned.

816
00:41:13,536 --> 00:41:15,302
What?

817
00:41:15,338 --> 00:41:16,838
What do you know?

818
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:18,740
It won't change anything.

819
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:19,874
What did you make me do?

820
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:25,379
My team...

821
00:41:25,414 --> 00:41:28,515
they tried to record messengers...

822
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:34,020
...but any incoming signal
caused static on our devices.

823
00:41:35,017 --> 00:41:36,423
We needed a historian.

824
00:41:38,327 --> 00:41:40,994
And someone to synthesize the catalyst.

825
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,029
No.

826
00:41:43,065 --> 00:41:45,598
I was directed to create an antiviral.

827
00:41:45,634 --> 00:41:46,666
Actually,

828
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:48,101
you were directed

829
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:49,903
to expedite genetic recombination

830
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:52,105
of the historical pathogen.

831
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:53,774
You created the new virus.

832
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,941
No, no, no. She's delirious.

833
00:41:55,977 --> 00:41:57,828
The Director would never
order that mission.

834
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,480
Who said the mission
came from the Director?

835
00:42:03,084 --> 00:42:04,584
The future I left

836
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:05,685
was divided

837
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,953
between those loyal to the Director

838
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:10,290
and the Faction.

839
00:42:10,325 --> 00:42:12,024
Both sides fighting for control,

840
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,723
back and forth.

841
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,197
When you reset the Director,

842
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:20,866
we lost the ability to access the 21st.

843
00:42:20,902 --> 00:42:23,335
We lost the past, we lost everything.

844
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:25,537
We had no choice
but to shut down the reactor.

845
00:42:25,572 --> 00:42:27,339
We've had missions.

846
00:42:27,374 --> 00:42:28,607
Received messengers.

847
00:42:28,642 --> 00:42:31,476
And that's all. Only messengers.

848
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,779
Without the Director's processing power,

849
00:42:33,814 --> 00:42:37,215
consciousness transfer isn't possible.

850
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,998
So...

851
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:41,886
before power was cut to the Director,

852
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:44,323
in our last moment of control,

853
00:42:44,358 --> 00:42:47,458
we sent everyone we could to the 21st.

854
00:42:47,493 --> 00:42:49,460
All at once.

855
00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:51,062
Into the quantum frame?

856
00:42:51,097 --> 00:42:52,063
How many?

857
00:42:52,098 --> 00:42:53,231
The frame is capable

858
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:54,598
of receiving and storing thousands.

859
00:42:54,634 --> 00:42:55,599
So Forbes,

860
00:42:55,635 --> 00:42:57,836
all those people with the FBI...

861
00:42:57,871 --> 00:42:58,870
Are all Faction.

862
00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:00,771
Every mission we've done since...

863
00:43:00,807 --> 00:43:02,111
...Has been for them.

864
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:04,575
The Faction has our own plan.

865
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,743
Overpopulation

866
00:43:05,778 --> 00:43:08,111
is the single greatest threat
to the 21st century.

867
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:13,016
The Director wasn't capable
of seeing the natural solution.

868
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:15,686
How many people are gonna die?

869
00:43:15,722 --> 00:43:17,254
The virus is genetically engineered

870
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:20,123
to preserve 70% of the population.

871
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:21,358
The future will survive.

872
00:43:22,527 --> 00:43:24,694
And those of us who die, including me,

873
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,030
will have made a great sacrifice.

874
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:28,165
70%?

875
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,600
Jenny, you're murdering
over 2 billion people.

876
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:34,037
The mission comes first.

877
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:39,108
Take positions
around the device and stand by.

878
00:43:43,014 --> 00:43:44,647
What the hell is that?

879
00:43:56,735 --> 00:44:01,104
