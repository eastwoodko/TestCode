1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,447
Previously on Travelers.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,800
Can you feel that?

3
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,436
The latest ultrasound looks good.

4
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:07,070
You and the baby are fine.

5
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:08,606
You got three races out of five

6
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:09,878
with those stupid odds.

7
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:10,877
How did that happen?

8
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:12,546
The timeline has changed a lot.

9
00:00:12,548 --> 00:00:14,347
We are in serious financial trouble.

10
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,082
What happened
to we're all on the same side?

11
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:17,584
I don't want to be in the same room.

12
00:00:17,586 --> 00:00:19,019
I should be leading this team.

13
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:19,853
Do we have a problem?

14
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:20,854
No.

15
00:00:20,856 --> 00:00:22,355
FBI! Show me your hands!

16
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:24,490
Son of a bitch.

17
00:00:24,492 --> 00:00:25,391
Sergeant Richard Hall,

18
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,259
you have the right to remain silent.

19
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:27,260
Anything you say

20
00:00:27,262 --> 00:00:29,395
can and will be used against you...

21
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,930
First time?

22
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,185
Yeah. You?

23
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,450
Second.

24
00:01:00,688 --> 00:01:02,221
Third for him.

25
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:12,637
Good evening, Historians.

26
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,473
Welcome to Regional Update 4.

27
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:17,075
I'm Traveler A-26
of the archivist program.

28
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,514
If this is your first time,

29
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:19,688
please take a moment

30
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,470
to look inside the bag
you were provided on the way in.

31
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:27,307
The two green pills

32
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:29,809
are to be taken immediately
following the update.

33
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,943
It's important

34
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:33,813
that we restore any chemical
imbalances in the brain.

35
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:37,330
The yellow pills
you will need going forward.

36
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:39,418
From time to time,

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,720
you may perceive
what we call "projections..."

38
00:01:41,722 --> 00:01:43,156
visual manifestations

39
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:46,530
of one or more alternate timelines...

40
00:01:46,895 --> 00:01:47,960
an unavoidable side-effect

41
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:50,263
of memory not acquired
by conventional means.

42
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,064
The yellow pills

43
00:01:53,066 --> 00:01:55,167
will help to focus
your sensory perception

44
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:57,336
on one timeline at a time.

45
00:01:57,338 --> 00:01:58,609
When you run out,

46
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:01,173
call this number to arrange for more.

47
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:02,610
Get that?

48
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:04,145
Yeah.

49
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:06,244
Next, Protocol 2H...

50
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,582
the update is not to be
discussed with anyone.

51
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,918
Ever.

52
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,052
Do not break this protocol.

53
00:02:14,054 --> 00:02:16,587
This update will include
historical information

54
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:19,291
relevant to your team's role
in the Grand Plan,

55
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:22,194
including potential candidates,
investments, etc.

56
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,296
But by its very nature,

57
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:27,632
your update may also include
historical information

58
00:02:27,634 --> 00:02:30,835
about your team members, loved ones.

59
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:32,036
About you.

60
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:34,639
This is a burden
you will have to carry with you

61
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:36,474
until the day you die...

62
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:38,443
a date which, for obvious reasons,

63
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:40,378
will be omitted from your update.

64
00:02:42,381 --> 00:02:43,613
Any questions?

65
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,610
Let's begin.

66
00:02:51,023 --> 00:02:52,656
Historians.

67
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:54,725
Open memory chain 1A.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

69
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:11,253
Hey. I made breakfast.

70
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:12,930
I don't wanna be late.

71
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:15,410
Hey, come on, Carly.

72
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,530
Take five minutes.

73
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,877
Grant! They chose me!

74
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,479
Who?

75
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:27,081
The Pattersons.

76
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,437
Uh...

77
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:30,451
You know, the restaurant owners.

78
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,452
Jill...

79
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:33,254
Jill. Right.

80
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,622
This means what exactly?

81
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,425
That I will be designing
their new restaurant

82
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:39,560
with a brand-new baby.

83
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:41,428
Well, you'll have my help with the baby.

84
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,931
I can't take a job
that I don't have time to do...

85
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:45,566
Kat... We'll figure it out.

86
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:48,143
- So I should say yes?
- Do you want to say yes?

87
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:49,402
Yes. Then yes.

88
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,170
Okay.

89
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,607
I'll let them know.

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,912
Nice work.

91
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:10,490
Hey, guys.

92
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:11,491
Hey.

93
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,159
What's the mission?

94
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:16,128
I got a messenger

95
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,630
with lotto numbers yesterday.

96
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:18,698
Director must've seen

97
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,332
we're in a bit of a financial hole

98
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:21,467
and decided to step up.

99
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:22,535
Good.

100
00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:24,196
I obviously can't win any more lotteries

101
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,471
without attracting undue attention,

102
00:05:25,473 --> 00:05:27,139
so...

103
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:28,940
you won 86k

104
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,642
on the super draw last night...

105
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:31,643
And these numbers

106
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:32,978
on the mega ball for tonight

107
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,013
will get you 62.

108
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:37,450
$62 doesn't sound like very much.

109
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,652
$62,000.

110
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:42,121
Oh, good.

111
00:05:42,123 --> 00:05:44,489
You both get 6 numbers out of 7.

112
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:46,224
Why don't we just win
7 out of 7 and we're covered?

113
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:47,711
Because historically,

114
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:49,027
someone else is supposed
to win the big one

115
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:50,028
and completely ruin their lives.

116
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,457
What about me?

117
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,164
You are too young to gamble.

118
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,333
An excellent example of irony.

119
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:59,137
So will that get us out of the hole?

120
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:00,471
Not even close.

121
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:01,739
This is seed money.

122
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,874
But I can quadruple it with horse races

123
00:06:03,876 --> 00:06:04,875
and use those earnings

124
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:06,477
to create something far more substantial.

125
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,146
How does that even work

126
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,214
if the historical record has changed?

127
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,651
The messenger gave me
very detailed instructions.

128
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,520
We're good.

129
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:16,932
Congratulations, you guys!

130
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:18,689
- Sweet.
- Thanks.

131
00:06:56,194 --> 00:06:57,293
So?

132
00:06:57,295 --> 00:06:58,294
What did you think?

133
00:06:58,296 --> 00:06:59,963
I liked it. It's like therapy.

134
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:02,031
Yeah. That's the idea.

135
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,600
We should do it more often.

136
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:05,401
I'm in.

137
00:07:05,403 --> 00:07:06,402
Hey, do you know

138
00:07:06,404 --> 00:07:07,403
if there's a store around here anywhere?

139
00:07:07,405 --> 00:07:10,573
So do I go for the $3.00 water,

140
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:13,875
the luxurious $5.00 bottle of water,

141
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:17,010
or the suspiciously-underpriced
99-cent water?

142
00:07:20,551 --> 00:07:22,118
You're buying a lottery ticket?

143
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,284
Mm-hmm.

144
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:24,720
Thanks.

145
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:26,421
I buy one once in a while

146
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:29,424
when the jackpot gets
insanely big like this one.

147
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:30,759
I don't know why.

148
00:07:30,761 --> 00:07:33,895
I mean, any size jackpot
would change my life.

149
00:07:34,898 --> 00:07:36,732
I always play my same lucky numbers.

150
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,566
Yeah. Do you ever win?

151
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:40,735
Nope.

152
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:48,291
Thank you.

153
00:07:50,286 --> 00:07:51,285
Thanks.

154
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:09,930
What's up?

155
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:11,850
Why'd you stop playing?

156
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,035
Same reason you did.

157
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,236
You got a concussion, too?

158
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:17,871
Whatever, Trevor.

159
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,274
Whoa, Kyle!

160
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:21,275
Don't try to tell me

161
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:22,676
that you don't remember what he did to us

162
00:08:22,678 --> 00:08:24,275
because of your concussions.

163
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:27,147
Nobody forgets shit like that.

164
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:31,417
Maybe I just don't like
to think about it...

165
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:42,250
Hey. Can I help you?

166
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,364
No, I don't need any help.

167
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:47,032
Do you need any help?

168
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:48,067
I'm good.

169
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,569
Yeah, no, we're good.

170
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,504
Who's your friend?

171
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:52,405
Kyle.

172
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,073
Well, hello, Kyle. Nice to meet you.

173
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,910
You know, Trevor and us, we...
we go way, way back.

174
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,214
I'm Hall. This is my associate, Luca.

175
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:02,480
Hey.

176
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:03,481
Hey.

177
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:05,184
Hey, Trevor, I'm gonna go.

178
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:06,685
I'll catch up with you later.

179
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,025
Boss, it's me.

180
00:09:13,027 --> 00:09:14,193
What's up?

181
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:15,961
Hall and Luca got out of prison early.

182
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:18,496
How do you know?

183
00:09:18,498 --> 00:09:20,064
Because I'm standing
right in front of 'em.

184
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,566
They're parked outside the school.

185
00:09:21,568 --> 00:09:24,102
I guess they don't know
I don't like being watched.

186
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:25,537
Tough guy. I love it!

187
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,539
Do me a favor...

188
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,490
Give my regards to the boy scout.

189
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:41,853
They just drove off.

190
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,721
What was that about? What'd he say?

191
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:44,756
Nothing.

192
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,557
Just thought you should know.

193
00:09:47,961 --> 00:09:49,293
Thanks for the heads up.

194
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:12,783
Hey, Philip.

195
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,419
Got your winnings.

196
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:19,171
Hopefully, we get
more messengers like that.

197
00:10:23,728 --> 00:10:24,727
Where's the rest of it?

198
00:10:24,729 --> 00:10:26,091
I took some.

199
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,392
I need to invest that.

200
00:10:29,394 --> 00:10:30,790
Well, turns out

201
00:10:30,792 --> 00:10:31,768
"baby needs a new pair of shoes"

202
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,537
isn't just a saying.

203
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,638
And my van need a new transmission.

204
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,393
Okay.

205
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:40,309
I can make it work.

206
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:43,251
How is all that going, by the way?

207
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:45,946
You and Jeff and the baby?

208
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:48,919
Is it workin' out?

209
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:50,842
It's fine. Why?

210
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:52,414
I don't know, just asking.

211
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,796
Asking what exactly?

212
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:57,211
Uh... if things were okay at home?

213
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,033
Are you developing a thing for me?

214
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,491
No!

215
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,470
I just haven't...

216
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:06,005
heard you talk about
that in a while, and...

217
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,006
It's all good.

218
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:08,440
Great.

219
00:11:11,198 --> 00:11:14,333
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I think you're very attractive.

220
00:11:20,587 --> 00:11:21,586
This is weird.

221
00:11:21,588 --> 00:11:22,554
I agree.

222
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:23,522
I'm going to go.

223
00:11:23,524 --> 00:11:24,523
Okay.

224
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:25,824
Thanks for the cash.

225
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:41,439
Atta boy.

226
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:42,740
Come on, Kyle.

227
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:53,971
Come on, Kyle! One, two.

228
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:55,865
Atta boy.

229
00:11:57,157 --> 00:11:58,155
Atta boy!

230
00:11:58,157 --> 00:12:00,257
Way to work out some of that aggression.

231
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,492
Come on, let's get some water.

232
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,559
Come on, let's keep going.

233
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:05,517
Have a drink. Come on.

234
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:10,691
Let's talk a bit.

235
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:11,969
Leave it alone.

236
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:13,891
The old man can't touch us anymore.

237
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,339
Come on.

238
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:16,840
One, two, one, two.

239
00:12:19,711 --> 00:12:20,844
One, two.

240
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,111
One, two. One, two.

241
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,817
Why haven't you told anybody?

242
00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:29,486
Why haven't you?

243
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:31,371
We're not talkin' about me.

244
00:12:33,725 --> 00:12:36,659
- He said if I let him...
- One, two.

245
00:12:36,661 --> 00:12:37,660
Come on, come on. One, two.

246
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:39,211
He'd take care of me!

247
00:12:39,904 --> 00:12:41,504
Set me up.

248
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,065
With scholarships and shit...

249
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,066
One, two.

250
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:50,171
What did he promise you, hmm?

251
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:53,542
The same.

252
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:57,079
Eight straight. Come on.

253
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,557
What if it's still going on
with other players?

254
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,479
Man, you know it is.

255
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,971
Then we gotta do something.

256
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,867
Like what?

257
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:20,268
You want to go to the police?

258
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,811
Go to the school?

259
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:24,272
Be his victims the rest of our lives?

260
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:25,273
If that ends it.

261
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:28,576
He can't stand against both of us.

262
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:33,515
We did nothing wrong, Kyle.

263
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,956
Would you... would you go in with me?

264
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:43,977
Absolutely.

265
00:13:47,296 --> 00:13:48,829
Come on. Let's see a two.

266
00:13:48,831 --> 00:13:50,297
Atta boy. One, two.

267
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:53,633
Grant?

268
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,122
Grant!

269
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:59,073
Grant!

270
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,460
Stay calm for us, Kathryn.

271
00:14:12,462 --> 00:14:14,153
Everything's
going to be fine, sweetheart.

272
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:16,255
This is exactly where you need to be.

273
00:14:16,257 --> 00:14:17,824
Grant, please don't leave.

274
00:14:17,826 --> 00:14:19,626
I'll stay right here. I promise.

275
00:14:21,262 --> 00:14:22,662
We're going to get her an ultrasound

276
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:23,897
and assess her from there.

277
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,264
She'll be out shortly.

278
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,588
Good morning, Trevor!

279
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,090
How are your grades?

280
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:54,358
Have you narrowed down
a list of colleges yet?

281
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,161
What can I do to better help you succeed?

282
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,696
I read my employee manual

283
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,499
and I am ready to guide the shit

284
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:02,966
outta these pubescent brats.

285
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:05,436
I need your help with something.

286
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,371
Marcy!

287
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,243
Hey!

288
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,611
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

289
00:15:18,383 --> 00:15:19,650
It's me. Luca.

290
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,171
2587.

291
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,822
I was just warned about you
watching members of my team.

292
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,324
I only want to talk.

293
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:30,460
Do you?

294
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,669
Hi, Kathryn.

295
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:42,672
I have the results from the ultrasound

296
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:43,706
and the baby is fine.

297
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,408
Oh, thank God.

298
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:48,010
You have formed

299
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:49,483
a small placental abruption,

300
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:50,680
so we want you to stay in for a bit,

301
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:53,015
just so we can monitor you and the baby,

302
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:54,416
make sure it doesn't get any worse.

303
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:55,608
But what if it does?

304
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,750
It won't.

305
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:57,853
If the baby forces our hand,

306
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,321
we can talk about our options,

307
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:00,389
but for now,

308
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:02,257
we just need to assess
where we're at, okay?

309
00:16:02,771 --> 00:16:05,327
Buzz the nurses if you need anything.

310
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:06,628
Thanks.

311
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,077
You don't remember
anything from that time?

312
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,406
Nothing.

313
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:25,113
I was briefed by members of my team

314
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:26,948
about the time I lost, but...

315
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,616
it's not the same as actually living it.

316
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,731
Well, at least now I know

317
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,891
why you never came to visit me in prison.

318
00:16:35,752 --> 00:16:36,851
Sorry.

319
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:40,961
You said you would have died...

320
00:16:41,938 --> 00:16:43,764
Losing my sister before I ever
really got to know her

321
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:44,765
would be worse than...

322
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,091
Luca, Luca...

323
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,971
we were separated so young.

324
00:16:50,171 --> 00:16:52,331
We can't know for sure
that we're really family.

325
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,609
Guys, it's Mac.

326
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:56,643
I'm going to be unavailable for a while.

327
00:16:56,645 --> 00:16:57,510
There's a problem...

328
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,232
What's wrong?

329
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:01,882
Kathryn's in the hospital.

330
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:03,283
She's had some medical...

331
00:17:03,691 --> 00:17:05,219
complications

332
00:17:05,221 --> 00:17:07,221
and I need to be here with her.

333
00:17:13,262 --> 00:17:14,261
Marcy?

334
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:15,895
Yeah. I'm on my way.

335
00:17:15,897 --> 00:17:17,971
- Is everything all right?
- Sorry, I have to go.

336
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:53,537
Holy...

337
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:56,563
Uh...

338
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:01,935
Hey, this is Marcy.

339
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:02,836
Leave a message.

340
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:04,697
Marcy, I won the lottery!

341
00:18:05,841 --> 00:18:06,940
6 numbers out of 7!

342
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:10,076
That's 31... $31,000!

343
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,345
Isn't that freaking amazing?

344
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,115
It would have been $62,000,

345
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:16,750
but someone else won the lottery.

346
00:18:16,752 --> 00:18:18,785
Oh, my God.

347
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:22,355
Oh, my God, that's you!!

348
00:18:22,357 --> 00:18:23,456
Because I took your numbers!

349
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,737
You won the lottery, too!
Congratulations!

350
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,377
Wait...

351
00:18:28,863 --> 00:18:31,998
I mean, that means
I took half your money.

352
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,299
I mean, that's like...

353
00:18:33,301 --> 00:18:34,834
That's like cheating.

354
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:36,177
Um...

355
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:38,938
Yeah, you know what,
I should just give it to you.

356
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,606
So...

357
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:42,308
That's what I'm gonna do.

358
00:18:44,345 --> 00:18:45,210
But, I mean,

359
00:18:45,212 --> 00:18:46,245
what are the chances

360
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:47,179
that your numbers would be picked

361
00:18:47,181 --> 00:18:48,897
any more than my mine, right?

362
00:18:49,717 --> 00:18:51,483
Oh, my God, did you hear
the greed in my voice?

363
00:18:51,485 --> 00:18:53,097
Because I sure did.

364
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,120
I mean, I may as well

365
00:18:55,122 --> 00:18:57,937
have just come out and said
"That money's mine!"

366
00:19:01,195 --> 00:19:02,627
This is how money ruins people.

367
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:05,997
I think I'm going to be sick.

368
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:15,507
Still no answer.

369
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:20,745
We said we'd meet after second period.

370
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:23,514
You know, for my first actual case

371
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:24,816
as a guidance counselor,

372
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:26,517
you could have eased me into it.

373
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,086
Holden!

374
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:29,888
I have been looking all over for you.

375
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,389
Connor needs a QB
that can hit him in the hands

376
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:33,017
if we want to win state.

377
00:19:39,865 --> 00:19:41,399
So...

378
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:42,937
we'd love to have you out.

379
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,177
And Connor, how are things?

380
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:55,617
Could use my old quarterback
back on the team.

381
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:58,548
Talk some sense into him.

382
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,884
Oh, I don't understand sportsball, so...

383
00:20:01,337 --> 00:20:03,737
Can't keep a spot open for you
forever, Trev.

384
00:20:11,296 --> 00:20:12,395
Why didn't you just deal with him

385
00:20:12,397 --> 00:20:13,396
right then and there?

386
00:20:13,398 --> 00:20:14,897
Not in front of the kid.

387
00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:17,100
It's gonna be hard
enough on him as it is.

388
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:33,628
_

389
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,958
78...

390
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,727
79...

391
00:20:45,729 --> 00:20:47,463
1,000.

392
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,302
I'm really diggin'
us workin' out together.

393
00:20:53,304 --> 00:20:55,157
Yeah? That's good.

394
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:56,905
And this playlist...

395
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:58,337
Damn.

396
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:00,441
You like it?

397
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:02,177
Oh, yeah.

398
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:03,278
You gotta...

399
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,589
You gotta get that...
that core engaged, right?

400
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:06,621
You know what I mean?

401
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:07,645
Get that heart rate up.

402
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:12,987
You know what I mean?

403
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:15,490
Come on, Carly.

404
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:17,091
You know that body likes to dance.

405
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:20,828
I don't even know what you're doing.

406
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,863
Come on, Carly, it'll come to you.

407
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,257
Let it go.

408
00:21:31,273 --> 00:21:33,377
- That's right.
- Okay.

409
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:37,712
There she is.

410
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:00,267
Hey.

411
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,634
What did you find?

412
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:02,635
I took a look at her file.

413
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:03,970
There's nothing out of the ordinary.

414
00:22:03,972 --> 00:22:05,238
She's stable.

415
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,372
I mean, her blood pressure's
a little high...

416
00:22:06,374 --> 00:22:07,573
Those drugs you gave me...

417
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,743
shouldn't they have
protected her from this?

418
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,457
They were designed to help,
not to make her invulnerable.

419
00:22:13,314 --> 00:22:14,680
How do we get you in there?

420
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:16,315
I don't think you understand...

421
00:22:16,317 --> 00:22:18,384
there's nothing even I could do.

422
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,085
She's right where she needs to be,

423
00:22:20,087 --> 00:22:21,686
and if they need
to take the baby out early,

424
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:22,754
a Caesarean section

425
00:22:22,756 --> 00:22:25,022
is a standard procedure
for these doctors.

426
00:22:28,595 --> 00:22:31,497
Medicine isn't magic... in any time.

427
00:22:33,066 --> 00:22:35,657
Would you like me to inform
the team of what's going on?

428
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:38,137
No.

429
00:22:38,738 --> 00:22:40,838
No, I'll do it when the time is right.

430
00:22:44,878 --> 00:22:47,444
...And, uh, yeah,

431
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:48,579
it just feels good to know

432
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:51,215
I'm not doing that to my family anymore.

433
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:52,937
Thank you, Mike.

434
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:56,400
Philip...

435
00:22:57,222 --> 00:22:58,589
did you want to share?

436
00:23:00,092 --> 00:23:02,377
Uh, yeah, I do.

437
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:05,962
Hi. My name's Philip and I'm an addict.

438
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,665
Hi, Philip.

439
00:23:11,136 --> 00:23:12,977
I have a secret.

440
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:16,497
I know the future.

441
00:23:18,543 --> 00:23:20,543
I know what's going to happen.

442
00:23:21,377 --> 00:23:23,280
Global events.

443
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:25,115
Deaths.

444
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:27,097
Winners of horse races.

445
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,721
It was all recently
delivered to me like a movie.

446
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:38,428
And mostly, it's the same future
that I remember,

447
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,929
but there are differences.

448
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:46,737
You all think I'm crazy right now...

449
00:23:47,738 --> 00:23:49,438
but it's true.

450
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:57,146
For example, I know
that somebody in this room

451
00:23:57,148 --> 00:23:59,448
has very recently
been diagnosed with cancer

452
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,337
and has decided to ignore it.

453
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:07,188
As if ignoring the problem
is going to make it go away.

454
00:24:08,925 --> 00:24:11,737
Because there is only a 50/50 chance

455
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:13,328
that the treatment will work.

456
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:18,166
And they're afraid

457
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:20,977
of going through the pain
of chemotherapy for nothing.

458
00:24:22,472 --> 00:24:23,504
And the truth is,

459
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:24,577
I don't know...

460
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:27,708
whether this person
is going to live or die

461
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,310
if they decide to get treatment.

462
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:34,782
I only know for certain
that without it...

463
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:36,484
Philip?

464
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,653
Philip?

465
00:24:42,324 --> 00:24:44,358
I'm sorry, what... what was I saying?

466
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:46,326
Not much.

467
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:49,829
You stopped talking

468
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:51,831
after you said "I have a secret."

469
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:55,297
Oh.

470
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:57,737
I'm sorry. Um...

471
00:24:57,739 --> 00:25:00,540
maybe someone else should go.

472
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:03,097
It's all right.

473
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:05,512
We've all been there.

474
00:26:00,868 --> 00:26:01,894
Where have you been?

475
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,328
I'm on my way now.

476
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,296
Don't worry about it, bro.

477
00:26:04,298 --> 00:26:05,297
We're gonna do this.

478
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,732
Have you been drinking?

479
00:26:06,734 --> 00:26:07,733
Pull over.

480
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:09,902
Trevor, I'm fine. Chill.

481
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:10,903
Where are you?

482
00:26:10,905 --> 00:26:12,371
Where are you? Where are you?

483
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:32,448
_

484
00:26:49,421 --> 00:26:51,654
Oh, hey, nurse. How's she doing?

485
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,552
Excuse me. I asked you a question.

486
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,487
No.

487
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,855
It was for your own good.

488
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:06,897
What did you do?

489
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,225
Code blue. Code blue.

490
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:11,795
Go be with her.

491
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:19,402
Dr. Higgins, what's happening?

492
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,870
I can't talk right now, Mr. MacLaren.

493
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,305
Please stay out of the way.

494
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,781
Philip, I need eyes on Hall right now.

495
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,283
He's leaving the hospital.

496
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:34,377
I'm on it.

497
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,291
Don't lose him.

498
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:51,666
_

499
00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:21,060
Kyle! Kyle!

500
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,166
Back up!

501
00:28:27,168 --> 00:28:28,635
Kyle, get outta the car.

502
00:28:36,578 --> 00:28:38,177
There's something wrong with this host.

503
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:41,346
You're just drunk.

504
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:46,385
Traveler 5532,

505
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,746
welcome to the 21st.

506
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:01,633
This is too much.

507
00:29:01,635 --> 00:29:03,601
Andrew, I have watched you

508
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:05,737
do everything in your power
to change your circumstances.

509
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:07,405
I mean, you got clean,

510
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:09,907
you got that part-time job
at the grocery store.

511
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:11,942
This is just a little financial help

512
00:29:11,944 --> 00:29:13,210
to put a roof over your head.

513
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:15,012
But I'll never
be able to repay you. This...

514
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:16,492
No, I don't want you to.

515
00:29:16,494 --> 00:29:17,399
Just, just...

516
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:19,216
Just keep doing what you're doing

517
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:22,086
and I'll count myself lucky to know you.

518
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,021
I don't know what to say.

519
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:25,489
You don't have to say anything.

520
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:28,259
Thank you, David.

521
00:29:31,063 --> 00:29:32,462
Okay.

522
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,037
Okay.

523
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:52,809
Wendy?

524
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:56,986
I'd like to make your day.

525
00:30:04,061 --> 00:30:05,060
Come on.

526
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:06,884
You must know something by now.

527
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:08,230
My latest information

528
00:30:08,232 --> 00:30:11,767
is that your wife is still in surgery.

529
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,402
Mr. MacLaren.

530
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,786
Would you come with me, please?

531
00:30:24,982 --> 00:30:25,981
Philip!

532
00:30:26,386 --> 00:30:27,816
I need your help.

533
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,987
Look, I know

534
00:30:31,989 --> 00:30:34,756
that the historical record
has changed since we got here,

535
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:35,790
but not everything, right?

536
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,791
A lot stays the same.

537
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,026
Yeah, why?

538
00:30:38,028 --> 00:30:39,627
Carson Perry.

539
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,128
He's a football coach at my high school.

540
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,666
Ring any bells?

541
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,435
Come on, dig deep.

542
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:50,972
Carson Perry...

543
00:30:51,426 --> 00:30:53,675
gets arrested on 16 counts
of sexual-assault charges

544
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:55,009
as well as possession and distribution

545
00:30:55,011 --> 00:30:56,177
of under-age pornography.

546
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:57,044
When?

547
00:30:57,546 --> 00:30:58,445
Not soon.

548
00:30:58,447 --> 00:30:59,910
We can't wait.

549
00:30:59,912 --> 00:31:01,615
Trev, I've been through this,
you assign yourself vigilante...

550
00:31:01,617 --> 00:31:03,851
What if it's my protocol 5?

551
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:06,220
I recently learned

552
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:08,826
that my host was abused
before I got here by him.

553
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:11,825
I had no idea.

554
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:13,026
Neither did I.

555
00:31:15,364 --> 00:31:17,564
I promised my friend, Kyle,
that I would help take him down,

556
00:31:17,566 --> 00:31:18,565
and just now...

557
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:19,900
Kyle was a host candidate.

558
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:22,102
- You knew?
- 3:09 this afternoon.

559
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:23,136
Driving drunk.

560
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:24,772
I'm sorry.

561
00:31:24,774 --> 00:31:26,573
I understand why you couldn't tell me,

562
00:31:26,575 --> 00:31:29,186
but as far as I'm concerned,
that coach killed him.

563
00:31:29,946 --> 00:31:31,177
I need to fix this...

564
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:37,918
Mr. MacLaren,

565
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,085
in this case,

566
00:31:39,087 --> 00:31:43,523
it was Antiphospholipid
Antibody Syndrome, or APS.

567
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:45,324
She developed an arterial thrombus,

568
00:31:45,326 --> 00:31:47,760
which then caused a coronary embolism,

569
00:31:47,762 --> 00:31:50,763
which is a clot in the heart.

570
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:52,946
Kathryn went into cardiac arrest.

571
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:58,370
Mr. MacLaren, in our efforts
to save Kathryn's life...

572
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,105
We lost the baby.

573
00:32:00,107 --> 00:32:01,266
Yes.

574
00:32:01,521 --> 00:32:03,108
And all I can say is

575
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,410
that it's extremely fortunate

576
00:32:04,412 --> 00:32:06,011
that that clot passed on its own,

577
00:32:06,013 --> 00:32:06,946
or this would be

578
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:08,080
an even more difficult conversation

579
00:32:08,082 --> 00:32:09,426
for both of us to have.

580
00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:15,546
When can I see her?

581
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:16,956
She's in recovery,

582
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:18,022
she's sedated,

583
00:32:18,024 --> 00:32:19,958
but you can see her in a few hours.

584
00:32:22,295 --> 00:32:23,428
Mr. MacLaren,

585
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,530
we have counselors
available if you need them.

586
00:32:25,532 --> 00:32:27,198
Philip, tell me where Hall is.

587
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,467
Boss, he's here.

588
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:29,734
What?

589
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,605
Hey, Boss. Easy.

590
00:32:35,908 --> 00:32:38,376
- Get off of me!
- We can't do that.

591
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:39,877
- You're a dead man!
- I know, I know, I know...

592
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:40,911
You killed my child!

593
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:42,246
That's not what happened.

594
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:43,647
You'd better hope the Director
overwrites you before I get...

595
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:45,416
The Director was the one who sent me!

596
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,719
I was on a mission.

597
00:32:49,822 --> 00:32:50,906
Let him go.

598
00:32:52,029 --> 00:32:53,028
Let him go.

599
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:55,493
There you go.

600
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,346
What're you talking about?

601
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:02,332
The child was never going to survive.

602
00:33:02,334 --> 00:33:03,501
It was never supposed to.

603
00:33:03,503 --> 00:33:04,434
You don't know that.

604
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:06,346
My mission was to save your wife.

605
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,939
There had to be a way to save them both.

606
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:11,666
I don't think there was.

607
00:33:12,244 --> 00:33:14,511
Listen to your medic, MacLaren.

608
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:17,780
What did you do?

609
00:33:17,782 --> 00:33:19,016
Kathryn MacLaren

610
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:20,013
was going to die

611
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:21,451
of an undiagnosed coronary embolism

612
00:33:21,453 --> 00:33:22,585
that stopped her heart

613
00:33:22,587 --> 00:33:24,787
during the delivery
of her stillborn child.

614
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:26,288
The Director ordered me

615
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,991
to give her a traveler-synthesized drug

616
00:33:27,993 --> 00:33:29,025
to eliminate the clot

617
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:30,793
so that she would survive,

618
00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:32,826
because she wasn't supposed to die.

619
00:33:33,832 --> 00:33:36,866
Because you broke Protocol 4.

620
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:43,372
She wanted a child more than anything...

621
00:33:44,642 --> 00:33:47,609
You're gonna stand there
and blame her for this?

622
00:33:47,611 --> 00:33:48,906
Is that what you're doing?

623
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,949
No.

624
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:57,819
Look, I get it.

625
00:33:57,821 --> 00:33:59,054
I get it.

626
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:00,388
It's tough to stay focused in the 21st.

627
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:01,623
I mean, that's what I've been
trying to tell you guys

628
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:02,751
ever since I met you.

629
00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:04,392
Trying to teach you guys

630
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:06,826
to not get caught up in all the bullshit.

631
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:10,666
But you had to stab me in the back, huh?

632
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,370
The Director obviously agreed with me

633
00:34:15,372 --> 00:34:17,106
or you wouldn't have gone to prison.

634
00:34:21,644 --> 00:34:22,843
Yeah...

635
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:24,346
I can't argue with that.

636
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,314
I guess we all need a lesson

637
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:27,866
now and then of what our mission is.

638
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,484
And this was yours.

639
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:31,783
But, hey.

640
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:34,266
MacLaren, your wife is still alive.

641
00:34:36,631 --> 00:34:38,164
Go be with her.

642
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,856
Welcome home.

643
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,691
Hey. Yeah. Sorry.

644
00:35:06,693 --> 00:35:07,926
- Hi.
- Hi.

645
00:35:07,928 --> 00:35:09,561
I know it's later than I said.

646
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:13,232
Can I hold him?

647
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:14,966
I was trying to get him to go to sleep.

648
00:35:14,968 --> 00:35:16,339
I know. I don't care.

649
00:35:16,341 --> 00:35:17,769
Hey.

650
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:20,046
You wanna cuddle with your mama, big man?

651
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:24,126
So...

652
00:35:24,611 --> 00:35:26,277
How was today for Carly Shannon?

653
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:29,814
It's over now, let's leave it at that.

654
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:30,882
You?

655
00:35:30,884 --> 00:35:32,050
I had a pay duty.

656
00:35:32,052 --> 00:35:34,152
I basically just chaperoned
some drunk college kids

657
00:35:34,154 --> 00:35:35,766
for time and a half.

658
00:35:36,757 --> 00:35:37,755
Sounds awful.

659
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:38,756
Wasn't so bad.

660
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:40,406
You okay?

661
00:35:41,594 --> 00:35:43,446
Tell me about the day he was born.

662
00:35:45,764 --> 00:35:46,963
Ah...

663
00:35:46,965 --> 00:35:48,665
Are you sure you wanna
go there right now?

664
00:35:49,286 --> 00:35:51,486
'Cause that's not your favorite story.

665
00:35:53,605 --> 00:35:55,938
I want to hear it from your perspective.

666
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:18,994
Grant?

667
00:36:18,996 --> 00:36:20,566
I'm here.

668
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,369
They told me she was a girl.

669
00:37:01,804 --> 00:37:03,204
Holden.

670
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:05,340
Change your mind?

671
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:06,673
You're going to come clean.

672
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:08,185
Sorry?

673
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:10,344
You're going to come forward
to the police

674
00:37:10,346 --> 00:37:12,846
and you're going to detail
all that you've done.

675
00:37:13,482 --> 00:37:15,682
Trevor, what are you talking about?

676
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:19,019
Do it on your on volition
and face the consequences,

677
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:20,686
or it'll be done for you.

678
00:37:22,858 --> 00:37:23,724
Yeah?

679
00:37:23,726 --> 00:37:25,058
Mm-hmm.

680
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,846
I'm not gonna do that.

681
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:29,195
Those are your only two options.

682
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:32,899
I don't think you realize
what you're doing here.

683
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,702
You're really willing
to throw everything away

684
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:37,437
to destroy both of our lives?

685
00:37:37,439 --> 00:37:38,838
There are other lives to consider.

686
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,939
Oh, come on.

687
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:41,741
Maybe you don't want
to play football anymore,

688
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:43,076
but you do not want

689
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:44,277
the shit storm that'll come from this.

690
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:47,006
You prey on young boys
who look up to you.

691
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:50,383
You make promises

692
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,418
in exchange for access to their bodies.

693
00:37:54,222 --> 00:37:55,788
Come on, Trev.

694
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,757
I will come forward.

695
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:04,630
I'll talk about
the hotel rooms on the road.

696
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:06,299
The showers.

697
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:07,300
All of it.

698
00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:10,135
Who's gonna believe you?

699
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:12,104
You're a bad kid and everybody knows it.

700
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:13,571
People change.

701
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:15,740
Not the Trevor Holden I know...

702
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:18,443
I don't know where this act came from,

703
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:20,578
but I don't buy it for a second.

704
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,747
I know you.

705
00:38:22,749 --> 00:38:24,766
Intimately.

706
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:27,752
You're going to keep your mouth shut.

707
00:38:28,526 --> 00:38:29,654
I'm not threatened by you.

708
00:38:29,656 --> 00:38:31,289
You should be.

709
00:38:34,294 --> 00:38:35,760
Don't push me, kid.

710
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:50,741
Release the materials.

711
00:38:50,743 --> 00:38:51,608
On it.

712
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,609
"Release the materials?"

713
00:38:52,611 --> 00:38:54,246
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

714
00:39:00,153 --> 00:39:01,319
Thank you, Philip.

715
00:39:01,321 --> 00:39:04,120
That's what Trevor and Kyle
would've wanted.

716
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:07,190
All we did was accelerate
what was going to happen anyway.

717
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:11,246
Freak had whole hard drives
of incriminating shit.

718
00:39:11,964 --> 00:39:13,606
He made his choice.

719
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:22,686
No...

720
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:25,342
What?

721
00:39:27,379 --> 00:39:28,845
Oh, no.

722
00:39:33,818 --> 00:39:34,817
Oh, no.

723
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:36,051
Oh, my God.

724
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,129
Oh...

725
00:39:58,286 --> 00:39:59,726
There she is!

726
00:40:01,545 --> 00:40:02,711
Did you get your winnings?

727
00:40:02,713 --> 00:40:03,712
I did.

728
00:40:03,714 --> 00:40:04,914
Amazing luck.

729
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,215
Isn't it!

730
00:40:06,217 --> 00:40:08,149
You're not upset that I cheated?

731
00:40:08,151 --> 00:40:10,852
No, of course not. I'm happy for you.

732
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:12,197
You must be thrilled.

733
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:13,843
Yeah! Yeah.

734
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:15,302
It's all gone.

735
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,659
What?

736
00:40:17,661 --> 00:40:19,628
Did you ever hear
of the story of St. Francis?

737
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,695
No.

738
00:40:20,697 --> 00:40:21,730
Yeah. No, me neither.

739
00:40:21,732 --> 00:40:23,264
Somebody called me that today.

740
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:26,334
I don't understand.

741
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:27,535
I didn't feel right

742
00:40:27,537 --> 00:40:28,702
taking what would have been yours

743
00:40:28,704 --> 00:40:29,938
if I hadn't peeked at your numbers,

744
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,272
and I know

745
00:40:31,274 --> 00:40:32,773
that you wouldn't let me give it back,

746
00:40:32,775 --> 00:40:33,975
so I gave it all away.

747
00:40:35,278 --> 00:40:36,610
I helped out a lot of good people.

748
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:38,346
Honestly, Marcy, it was...

749
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:39,948
it was the best day of my life.

750
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,483
Remember my...

751
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:43,751
my client, Jason,

752
00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:46,730
with the bad teeth and the hair?

753
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:47,888
Yeah. I do.

754
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:49,089
Yeah. Great teeth now.

755
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:51,191
I mean, they will be.

756
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:53,846
Even getting them cleaned
has made a huge difference.

757
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,171
And on Wednesday,

758
00:40:55,173 --> 00:40:57,230
he's got some much needed dental work.

759
00:40:57,232 --> 00:40:58,765
Good for Jason.

760
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:01,126
Yeah! No, he hates dentists.

761
00:41:01,736 --> 00:41:03,437
Who else?

762
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:05,705
I'm not sure if you remember Marjorie.

763
00:41:05,707 --> 00:41:07,107
I bought her a new walker.

764
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:08,766
They're pricey for what they are.

765
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:12,412
Steve got one of those scooters
to get to his new job.

766
00:41:12,414 --> 00:41:15,166
He can't walk very far
without breaking into a sweat.

767
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,086
Jordan got my bike
for his pizza delivery job.

768
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:19,118
Your bike?

769
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,319
Yeah.

770
00:41:20,321 --> 00:41:22,526
Yeah, I thought I'd buy myself a new one.

771
00:41:23,937 --> 00:41:25,470
I should have saved some.

772
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:27,260
All of it?

773
00:41:27,262 --> 00:41:29,528
I know it sounded like a lot of money,

774
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,997
but, I mean, everything
is just so expensive,

775
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:34,933
and I had a whole list of people.

776
00:41:37,405 --> 00:41:38,870
- David...
- It doesn't matter.

777
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:40,306
I'll get my steps in.

778
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:42,326
So...

779
00:41:43,411 --> 00:41:44,410
what're you gonna do with yours?

780
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:47,212
Um...

781
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:48,814
I have some debts to pay off.

782
00:41:48,816 --> 00:41:50,188
Debts!

783
00:41:50,304 --> 00:41:51,670
Wow, that is responsible.

784
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,893
I should have some left over.

785
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,822
Even more responsible!

786
00:41:58,591 --> 00:41:59,624
So what're you gonna do with it?

787
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:02,627
Well, first...

788
00:42:02,629 --> 00:42:04,261
I'm going to buy you a new bike.

789
00:42:05,632 --> 00:42:07,366
I'm so happy you said that.

790
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:20,900
What's happening right now?

791
00:42:20,925 --> 00:42:22,024
Where the hell is this kid?

792
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:24,061
_

793
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,916
Give him a minute.

794
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:26,984
He's probably hungover.

795
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,599
I'm sorry, he's what?

796
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,326
Sorry, I'm late.

797
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:36,359
I was having a hard time

798
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:37,924
deciding what clothing to bring with me.

799
00:42:37,926 --> 00:42:39,596
Yeah, not a problem, kid.

800
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,864
Just don't make it a habit.

801
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,468
So, what's the mission?

802
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:48,338
...The Prime Minister
has called highly threatening.

803
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,874
This will severely impact
foreign relations

804
00:42:50,876 --> 00:42:52,942
if the troops continue
to invade the region

805
00:42:52,944 --> 00:42:54,177
against U.N. sanctions.

806
00:42:54,179 --> 00:42:55,945
...In local news,

807
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:57,313
a fire ravaged

808
00:42:57,315 --> 00:42:59,448
a downtown apartment complex last night,

809
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,683
and authorities are saying

810
00:43:00,685 --> 00:43:03,486
that the cause is more than likely...

811
00:43:30,047 --> 00:43:31,479
The yellow pills

812
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:33,315
will help to focus
your sensory perception

813
00:43:33,317 --> 00:43:35,984
on one timeline at a time.

814
00:43:35,986 --> 00:43:37,519
An unavoidable side-effect

815
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:40,488
of memory not acquired
by conventional means...

816
00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:04,439
