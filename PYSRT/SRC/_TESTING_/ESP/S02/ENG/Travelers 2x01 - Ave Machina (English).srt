1
00:00:01,423 --> 00:00:03,022
Previously on Travelers...

2
00:00:03,023 --> 00:00:04,489
We're travelers from the future.

3
00:00:04,525 --> 00:00:05,657
In our time, many years from now,

4
00:00:05,693 --> 00:00:07,926
humanity has been all but wiped out.

5
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:09,428
We've come back to change that.

6
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:10,629
There are thousands of travelers

7
00:00:10,664 --> 00:00:12,163
already here taking part.

8
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,532
Let's save the world.

9
00:00:13,567 --> 00:00:15,166
Thanks.

10
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:16,635
No pressure.

11
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:18,937
I reset the Director.

12
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,004
What?

13
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,340
Rebooted its O.S. through a virus

14
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,474
to protect it from corruption

15
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:24,642
by the Faction.

16
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:26,277
What's happening in the future
while it's offline?

17
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:28,179
Chaos, probably.

18
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:30,648
A temporary power struggle.

19
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:32,116
Your team knows first-hand

20
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:34,152
the brutality they're capable of.

21
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:35,285
You mean they're the ones

22
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:36,320
who put us in those cages?

23
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:37,755
Duck.

24
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:40,658
What are you doing?

25
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:41,826
"Kill 3468..."

26
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:44,495
that is the mission
I was given by the Director.

27
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,464
We have to destroy the Quantum Frame...

28
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:47,965
- ...before they get here.
- Don't do it, son.

29
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,734
We don't have a choice,
they're going to be here soon!

30
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:50,735
Don't.

31
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,735
Ellis, there's another way...

32
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:54,004
They're coming in!

33
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,539
F.B.I., drop your weapons!

34
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:03,847
The dream begins the same every time...

35
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,910
_

36
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:22,491
Where's Greg?

37
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:23,626
Oh, he called in sick.

38
00:01:23,662 --> 00:01:24,760
I'm covering for him.

39
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:25,761
Just fix it, please.

40
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:27,163
Mr. Corrigan has
a conference call at 8:45.

41
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:28,197
Not a problem.

42
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:31,589
Greg, hey, thanks for coming.

43
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:32,580
I'm Vincent.

44
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:33,681
Screen's locked up again.

45
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:35,216
I'm gonna need it
for a call in five minutes.

46
00:01:35,252 --> 00:01:36,217
Can you get me back up?

47
00:01:36,253 --> 00:01:37,552
Oh, yeah, for sure.

48
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:38,900
I just need to get back there.

49
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:40,870
Hal? Listen, I gotta let the I.T. guy

50
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:42,083
work on the computer for a bit here.

51
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:43,617
Let me just duck into another office.

52
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:44,985
Yeah, let me put you on hold, hang on.

53
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,753
Just take two minutes, two minutes...

54
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:49,890
Sorry.

55
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,826
Just turn it off
and on again, I guess, huh?

56
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,461
No, no, no, sir.

57
00:02:05,981 --> 00:02:09,187
_

58
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:38,998
_

59
00:02:44,044 --> 00:02:46,512
From the moment
I arrive in the 21st Century,

60
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:48,413
something's wrong.

61
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:51,149
According to the historical record,

62
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:53,707
Anthony Corrigan, stockbroker,

63
00:02:54,188 --> 00:02:57,277
was at his desk on a conference call,

64
00:02:57,724 --> 00:03:00,948
but instead, it's someone else.

65
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:06,887
We were wrong.

66
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:13,271
I try to send the message,

67
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,196
but the computer freezes.

68
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,477
I practiced a hundred times,
but everything's wrong.

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,348
I try to reboot the system,
but there's no time now.

70
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:43,667
The mission's a failure.

71
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,274
So why should I sacrifice myself?

72
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:17,633
I decide I should at least
try to warn them.

73
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,135
Everyone listen!

74
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:22,472
I can't explain why,

75
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:23,906
but if you don't all
follow me right now,

76
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:25,842
you're going to die.

77
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,747
You have to leave now.

78
00:04:32,783 --> 00:04:34,216
Greg...

79
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,186
what the hell are you doing?

80
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,822
I run.

81
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:42,991
I don't even know what floor I'm on,

82
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:46,060
only that I have to hurry.

83
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,277
At first, I hear the plane...

84
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:06,914
and then the explosion.

85
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:13,254
And I don't remember anything else

86
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:15,856
until I'm outside, looking up.

87
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:18,325
All right, everybody, clear out.
Let's go.

88
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:31,972
We're going to need
that building evacuated.

89
00:05:49,624 --> 00:05:52,892
Everyone around me is looking
at the destruction above,

90
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,561
while I discard the last vestiges

91
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:57,424
of the man who was
supposed to die that day.

92
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:05,304
And then I hear the second plane.

93
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,475
And then I wake up.

94
00:06:17,952 --> 00:06:20,986
Dreams of 9/11 aren't uncommon, Vincent,

95
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:24,255
even for those who were
nowhere near ground zero.

96
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,192
I have the dream because it happened.

97
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,597
My mission was a proof of concept,

98
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:32,998
to send a confirmation

99
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:36,234
that I arrived safely
in the 21st Century,

100
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,470
then die, so no one could trace me.

101
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:39,471
But...

102
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:41,005
I survived.

103
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,708
They won't forgive that.

104
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,843
So you're afraid

105
00:06:45,878 --> 00:06:47,412
whomever you were
to send this message to

106
00:06:47,447 --> 00:06:49,214
intends to punish you?

107
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,117
They're already here.

108
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:54,219
I've seen the changes in history.

109
00:06:54,254 --> 00:06:57,217
At least, the histories that I remember.

110
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,758
And they'll be coming for me.

00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:33,990
Walt!

113
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:36,192
Jesus, what took you so long?

114
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:37,326
You're lucky they gave me permission

115
00:07:37,362 --> 00:07:38,728
- to talk to you at all...
- I'm gonna say one thing,

116
00:07:38,764 --> 00:07:40,196
and I need you to listen,

117
00:07:40,231 --> 00:07:41,731
destroy that device

118
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,967
by whatever means possible.

119
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:46,202
I've never asked you to do
anything more important.

120
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:47,336
What, that thing in the barn?

121
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:48,371
You need to do it now...

122
00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:49,539
What is it?

123
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:52,408
What is your association
with those people in the barn?

124
00:07:52,443 --> 00:07:54,777
They all raised a red flag
a few months back.

125
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:57,413
You said that they were
just a bunch of kids.

126
00:07:57,448 --> 00:07:59,081
I ask because

127
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:00,349
two of those people are in the hospital,

128
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,350
and a farmer is dead.

129
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:10,392
All right, I'll talk.

130
00:08:10,427 --> 00:08:11,694
A few weeks ago...

131
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:14,930
I received a top-secret
inter-departmental communication

132
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,132
asking if I'd noticed
any changes in you.

133
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:18,923
I told a pair of special agents

134
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,034
with very expensive sunglasses

135
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,236
that, yeah...

136
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:23,538
You know your friends are
giving you up as we speak.

137
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:25,207
Sir, can you please
be quiet so I can think?

138
00:08:25,242 --> 00:08:27,375
...and your wife noticed, too.

139
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:29,043
Nothing that either one of us
could point to,

140
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,144
but enough to say

141
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,246
that something is up.

142
00:08:32,282 --> 00:08:33,415
These people, whoever they are,

143
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,349
if they have something on you,
if they're using you,

144
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:36,617
if they're making you do things,

145
00:08:36,652 --> 00:08:38,019
we can protect you!

146
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:40,621
Destroy the device.

147
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,357
That's all I got.

148
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,093
They're never gonna do that, boss.

149
00:08:45,128 --> 00:08:46,660
Philip, stay off the coms.

150
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:49,831
I'm not talking to you anymore.

151
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:07,214
Before I go...

152
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:10,483
they wanted me to ask you about this.

153
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:14,421
Well, Walt,

154
00:09:15,523 --> 00:09:17,624
that's a handkerchief.

155
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,393
They tell me
it's a communication device.

156
00:09:20,428 --> 00:09:21,661
Really?

157
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:23,796
It's made from something
called graphine.

158
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,499
A technology we're working on
but we're not quite there yet.

159
00:09:26,534 --> 00:09:27,833
They suspect that it's powered

160
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:30,102
by the natural electricity
of the human body,

161
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:34,440
capable of broadcasting
an encrypted signal for miles.

162
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:36,309
This one came from
the high-school senior

163
00:09:36,344 --> 00:09:38,043
that's in surgery right now.

164
00:09:40,648 --> 00:09:42,148
How is she doing?

165
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:43,448
Rifle was shot from point-blank range.

166
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:45,450
There's severe damage
to the spleen and...

167
00:09:45,486 --> 00:09:46,833
Who are you?

168
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:47,933
Seriously, no one told you?

169
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:49,200
I'm a specialist,

170
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:50,555
here to assist from Grace hospital.

171
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,292
Call me Derek.

172
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:58,863
And suction?

173
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:00,891
Take care of that blood.

174
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,135
The bullet's causing
a lot of inflammation

175
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,304
between the T-12 and L-1.

176
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,705
I'm worried about the lumbar nerves.

177
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,706
We can't get ahead

178
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,107
of this blood loss anyway, so...

179
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,305
Okay.

180
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,279
Let's get it outta there.

181
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,250
I need to state for the record

182
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,384
that you gave me permission

183
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,519
to look at your phone
and listen to your messages

184
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,054
without a lawyer present.

185
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:25,589
Well, I have nothing to hide, so...

186
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,325
Wait, what are you doing?

187
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,527
I'm playing back a saved message.

188
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,528
Yeah, that one,

189
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:33,267
that has nothing to do
with... with anything.

190
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,767
Sir, the message came
from a phone registered to you

191
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,835
that called this number

192
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,504
two seconds before a man
with no identification...

193
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,708
who was allegedly holding
a gun to your head...

194
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,376
was fatally shot from
the apartment next door.

195
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,649
And you saved this message because...

196
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,652
It's kind of a keeper.

197
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,020
Hey, David, it's me.

198
00:10:57,056 --> 00:11:00,023
I guess it's my turn
to leave you a goofy message.

199
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,191
I just know how stressed out you get

200
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,525
when you don't hear from me,

201
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:06,262
so I wanted you to know that
I might be away for a while,

202
00:11:06,297 --> 00:11:08,398
maybe even relocated.

203
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,166
I just don't want you
wondering or worrying

204
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,534
if you don't hear from me.

205
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,569
You know, if it happens.

206
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:13,770
I don't even know for sure if it will,

207
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,242
but if it does,..

208
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:18,174
thank you for being there for me

209
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:20,676
when I really needed someone.

210
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:23,379
In another time or another life, right?

211
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:25,114
Goodbye, David.

212
00:11:28,652 --> 00:11:30,086
See?

213
00:11:31,186 --> 00:11:32,521
This is bullshit!

214
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,358
Jesus, he's having a bad day.

215
00:11:35,756 --> 00:11:36,888
Are you kidding me?

216
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:39,090
Hey, Jeff, keep your voice down.

217
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:40,091
I told you what happened.

218
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:41,760
The optics suck, and you know it.

219
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:43,795
It's on the news,
you shot a 13-year-old kid.

220
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,387
That was about to shoot Carly.

221
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:48,032
Who also murdered her mother
and brother last night.

222
00:11:49,129 --> 00:11:50,161
That kid?

223
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:51,418
Number 2 pencil to the head,

224
00:11:51,443 --> 00:11:52,408
both of them.

225
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,232
Girl was certifiable.

226
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:57,038
Now, get Carly's ass down here
to make a statement,

227
00:11:57,063 --> 00:11:58,029
and you're just

228
00:11:58,054 --> 00:11:59,186
the poor bastard who had to stop her.

229
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:01,944
Okay, Carly's not answering her cell.

230
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,005
We've been having trouble at home.

231
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,105
In the meantime, buddy, I'm sorry,

232
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,472
but I gotta take your badge.

233
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,251
Forensic's already got your gun.

234
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,309
Oh, come on,

235
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,543
this is bullshit, man.

236
00:12:10,578 --> 00:12:12,011
Let me just go down the hall
and talk to him.

237
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:13,045
Hey, no.

238
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,880
Not with booze on your breath, okay?

239
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,616
Hey, if I was forced to shoot a kid,

240
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:18,706
I might have a few drinks, too.

241
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:21,554
This is gonna work itself out.

242
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:24,724
Just go home.

243
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:34,075
I can see

244
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,467
there's a fight goin' on inside of you.

245
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:41,573
If you're worried about Kat...

246
00:12:41,608 --> 00:12:44,242
She is completely in the dark
about this.

247
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:45,844
She called me earlier

248
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,380
to tell me that you sent her away.

249
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,816
That your life was in danger
and so was hers.

250
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,206
Is that true?

251
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,654
It's what made me put a team together

252
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:57,389
to come after you.

253
00:12:57,424 --> 00:12:58,656
We were tracking your car,

254
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,291
and then it disappeared
like it went into a dead zone...

255
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:01,659
Yes, but...

256
00:13:01,694 --> 00:13:03,627
she's all right?

257
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:08,666
If you don't talk, you won't walk,

258
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,168
which means Kat may never, ever find out

259
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:11,970
whether you are dead or alive...

260
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:14,205
Destroy the device, Walt.

261
00:13:14,241 --> 00:13:15,939
Please.

262
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:18,999
I'm begging you.

263
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:23,748
Look, I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

264
00:13:23,783 --> 00:13:24,749
but I have also been told

265
00:13:24,784 --> 00:13:25,949
that that device is far beyond...

266
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,320
Thank you, Agent Forbes.

267
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:31,521
I'll take it from here.

268
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:33,757
Look, I need more time.

269
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:35,658
Seriously?

270
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:38,862
You're telling him
more than he's telling you.

271
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:41,932
But, hey, thanks for trying.

272
00:13:41,967 --> 00:13:43,833
Walt...

273
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:45,502
remember what I said.

274
00:13:45,537 --> 00:13:46,733
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

275
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:48,170
"Destroy the device."

276
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:50,072
He heard you the first time.

277
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,341
We all did.

278
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:56,813
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

279
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:01,674
Are you feeling threatened, Vincent?

280
00:14:04,545 --> 00:14:06,914
No, I have defenses in place.

281
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,482
Deuterium oxide
in the radiant heating system

282
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,151
acts as a fair space/time attenuator.

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,362
It slows neutrons.

284
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:19,135
Don't worry, it's not radioactive.

285
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,437
Uh...

286
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:22,772
Why wouldn't they just assume
that you died on 9/11?

287
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:25,199
Why do you think that
they're still after you?

288
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,136
Because they've already found me twice.

289
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:32,781
I found my way out of New York,

290
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:35,517
and took a train
to the Pacific Northwest.

291
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:38,087
I had the money
and the stock certificates

292
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:39,588
I'd taken from the safe,

293
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:40,722
but if I was going to stay hidden,

294
00:14:40,758 --> 00:14:41,982
I needed more.

295
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:44,192
Historically,

296
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:46,227
a man named Oliver Norton
became a tech millionaire

297
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:47,329
on his own,

298
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,498
and all I did was insert myself
into the process

299
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,132
as invisibly as possible,

300
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:53,026
and take my fair share.

301
00:14:54,638 --> 00:14:58,440
I had convinced Oliver that
I had debilitating phobias,

302
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:00,775
difficulties dealing with people,

303
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:02,077
privacy...

304
00:15:02,112 --> 00:15:03,778
I needed a front man for my company

305
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:05,813
that uses proprietary computer software

306
00:15:05,849 --> 00:15:08,149
to predict market trends.

307
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:09,584
Of course, I wouldn't let anyone see it,

308
00:15:09,619 --> 00:15:11,319
not even him.

309
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:12,787
As long as the predictions were correct,

310
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:14,114
he didn't care.

311
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:15,823
In fact, he was so grateful,

312
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:18,118
he constantly wanted to reward me.

313
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,662
And that's when Oliver introduced me

314
00:15:21,698 --> 00:15:23,965
to the woman who became Taylor's mother.

315
00:15:29,205 --> 00:15:30,397
Buddy!

316
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:32,339
Meet your new assistant.

317
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,340
Assistant?

318
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:34,341
Hi, Vincent,

319
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:35,342
it's a pleasure to meet you...

320
00:15:35,378 --> 00:15:36,776
No, no, I don't need an assistant.

321
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:37,878
Oh, yeah. You do.

322
00:15:37,913 --> 00:15:39,346
I got a company I gotta pretend to run.

323
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:40,647
No, sorry, I can't...

324
00:15:40,682 --> 00:15:42,016
Trust me, all right?

325
00:15:42,051 --> 00:15:43,650
I already told Irene

326
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:44,651
all about how you like to do things.

327
00:15:44,686 --> 00:15:46,520
No cell phones,
portable radios, webcams.

328
00:15:46,555 --> 00:15:48,588
No life, no fun...

329
00:15:48,624 --> 00:15:50,223
And I completely understand.

330
00:15:50,258 --> 00:15:51,858
Me, I don't like crowds.

331
00:15:57,232 --> 00:16:00,667
I-I'm not sure I'll have
anything for you to do.

332
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:02,101
High-maintenance people

333
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:04,370
always think that
they're low maintenance.

334
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:07,473
You need this, partner.

335
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:11,344
It wasn't an assistant I needed,

336
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:12,678
it was human contact...

337
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:16,210
and Oliver must have known that.

338
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,684
You said in our initial session

339
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,719
that your wife died of an aneurysm.

340
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:21,720
Yes.

341
00:16:21,756 --> 00:16:23,522
That was the first time
I was discovered.

342
00:16:23,558 --> 00:16:24,823
Dad?

343
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,491
You know I'm not to be disturbed

344
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,593
when I'm in this room.

345
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:28,894
Sorry, but Pepper wants out,

346
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,328
and Mr. Morraca isn't around.

347
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:33,999
Well... all right, take her out then.

348
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,434
I'll watch you from here.

349
00:16:35,469 --> 00:16:36,535
Okay.

350
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,036
Hi.

351
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,072
Hello.

352
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:41,373
Come on, Pepper.

353
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:44,008
He looks like you.

354
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:45,743
Fortunately for him,

355
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,746
he looks like the host
who provided the chromosomes.

356
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:50,848
Not me.

357
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,252
David Mailer?

358
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:03,560
Yeah.

359
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:05,162
I'm your lawyer.

360
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,698
I don't have a lawyer.

361
00:17:06,733 --> 00:17:09,700
Philip Pearson said
you might want my help.

362
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:12,035
I don't know Philip Pearson.

363
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:13,400
Friend of Marcy?

364
00:17:13,806 --> 00:17:15,239
Marcy? Oh, my God, yes.

365
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:16,574
Is she okay?

366
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,575
Are you...

367
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,311
what are you, like a... FBI lawyer?

368
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,546
Wow. No. No.

369
00:17:24,283 --> 00:17:26,382
Jeez, uh, he said
she said you were special,

370
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:27,918
but I didn't realize you were "special".

371
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:29,820
Well, this...

372
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,955
Sorry, this is...

373
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:33,223
I-I'm not good at this.

374
00:17:33,258 --> 00:17:34,524
This is so not my thing.

375
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,393
Well, David, fortunately
this is my thing,

376
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:39,193
and I am very good at this.

377
00:17:39,965 --> 00:17:40,931
So...

378
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:44,601
We're probably lookin' 10 years tops,

379
00:17:44,636 --> 00:17:47,036
nine with good behavior.

380
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,872
What?

381
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:52,442
Nah, just screwin' with you.

382
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,146
Why would you... Oh, my God.

383
00:17:59,307 --> 00:18:01,617
This isn't how actual
law-enforcement officers

384
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:02,785
behave, MacLaren.

385
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,354
There's giant chunks of time
missing from your logs.

386
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:06,689
It's a miracle

387
00:18:06,724 --> 00:18:08,223
we didn't catch on to you people sooner.

388
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,059
"You people"? What does that mean?

389
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:12,061
Agent Forbes says, compared
to just a few months ago,

390
00:18:12,096 --> 00:18:13,262
you are like a different person...

391
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:15,764
Jesus, take my blood,
take my fingerprints,

392
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,132
take whatever you need...

393
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:19,968
...who now spends half his time
with a high-school senior,

394
00:18:20,003 --> 00:18:21,102
his counselor,

395
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:22,471
a single mom,

396
00:18:22,506 --> 00:18:23,772
a heroin addict,

397
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:24,839
a farmer, and...

398
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,308
this one kills me...

399
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:30,279
a mentally-challenged woman
in the care of the state.

400
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:33,782
Philip Pearson is my C.I.
on a hacking case.

401
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,016
We suspected the device

402
00:18:35,052 --> 00:18:37,251
had something do with
hijacking Internet...

403
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,320
Let's skip over the part
where you pretend

404
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:41,089
there's a legit scenario

405
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:42,726
where those people,

406
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:44,125
in a fucking barn,

407
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:45,760
with whatever that device is,

408
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:48,862
makes any sense whatsoever.

409
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:55,936
Whoever you are

410
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,272
and whoever you work for,

411
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:02,476
we're on to you now.

412
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,847
I'm a single mom.

413
00:19:06,882 --> 00:19:09,750
There's a lot of folks like me.

414
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:13,386
This is going to sound weird,
and possibly insane,

415
00:19:13,422 --> 00:19:15,622
but I'm just gonna go ahead and say it.

416
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,158
I have a turtle at home,

417
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:19,793
and I had to leave in a hurry,

418
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:20,993
and there was a lot of broken glass...

419
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:22,396
You think this is funny?

420
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,031
No.

421
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:26,631
I'm just a librarian,

422
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,167
that's all I am.

423
00:19:28,203 --> 00:19:29,669
You're more than that.

424
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:42,134
Clamps...

425
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:49,774
She's fibrillating.

426
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:00,285
Charging, one, two, three.

427
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,619
Clear... shock.

428
00:20:08,427 --> 00:20:09,593
She's stabilizing.

429
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:10,895
There we go.

430
00:20:15,735 --> 00:20:17,134
That's not me.

431
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,837
It's clearly you.

432
00:20:20,873 --> 00:20:23,690
I have no memory of this.

433
00:20:24,502 --> 00:20:26,569
Don't I get a phone call or something?

434
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,112
Who do you want to call?

435
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:30,414
My babysitter for one.

436
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:33,450
Jeffrey Jr. is in the hands
of Washington Family Services.

437
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:34,818
What?

438
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:36,119
Why?

439
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:37,987
No, he needs to be with his mother!

440
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:40,556
God, how long are you
going to keep me here?

441
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:41,856
Sit back down, please...

442
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:43,659
Permission to break
the hell out of here.

443
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:44,660
I want to see my baby!

444
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:45,661
Sit down!

445
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:46,662
I want to see him now!

446
00:20:46,698 --> 00:20:47,663
All right, you call it.

447
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,083
I call what?

448
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:51,300
Uh... guys?

449
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:52,668
What are we doing?

450
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:54,370
Let me see it one more time.

451
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:58,241
On three.

452
00:20:59,844 --> 00:21:01,477
Two...

453
00:21:01,512 --> 00:21:02,778
I...

454
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:05,848
One.

455
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,659
On the move.

456
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,594
Right behind you.

457
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:27,969
Do we know what we're doing?

458
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:29,137
Getting out of here.

459
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,650
Don't forget Protocol 3.

460
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:43,652
Don't forget I was ordered to kill you.

461
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:44,652
Right.

462
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:45,653
This isn't a good time.

463
00:21:45,688 --> 00:21:47,288
Guys?

464
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:49,991
I think Philip's this way.

465
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:55,263
I took his legs out.

466
00:21:55,298 --> 00:21:56,297
He went down pretty hard.

467
00:21:56,332 --> 00:21:57,464
Marcy?

468
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:02,068
It's probably just a concussion.

469
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:03,069
He'll live.

470
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,672
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

471
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:06,072
Come on.

472
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:14,915
Hey!

473
00:22:33,921 --> 00:22:35,435
That looked like it hurt.

474
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,669
Well, they didn't try to kill anyone,

475
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,070
so you owe me a buck.

476
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:39,104
What's their progress?

477
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,640
Almost to the gym.

478
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:43,275
All right.

479
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,145
Let's see what they do.

480
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:53,418
Boss?

481
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,890
Jesus Christ...

482
00:22:57,925 --> 00:23:00,226
That isn't the way out.

483
00:23:00,261 --> 00:23:02,862
No. It isn't.

484
00:23:22,516 --> 00:23:26,049
Mac, we gotta go.

485
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,591
Go ahead.

486
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,531
Didn't think so.

487
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:45,134
Okay,

488
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:46,569
we're here.

489
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:47,995
Now what?

490
00:23:56,815 --> 00:23:58,147
We were wondering

491
00:23:58,182 --> 00:24:00,182
if you'd really try
to destroy the device,

492
00:24:00,218 --> 00:24:01,483
given the opportunity.

493
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,455
It seemed odd, considering
you built the thing.

494
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,623
Hey, but now that you're here,

495
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:09,959
maybe you can show us what it does.

496
00:24:11,462 --> 00:24:13,153
Under supervision,

497
00:24:13,697 --> 00:24:15,631
obviously.

498
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:18,133
Sorry.

499
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:22,971
Not gonna happen.

500
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,343
Dr. Kravitz,

501
00:24:28,378 --> 00:24:29,878
you have a visitor in the main lobby.

502
00:24:29,914 --> 00:24:32,647
Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor
in the main lobby.

503
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,383
Mr. and Mrs. Holden?

504
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:37,118
Is Trevor okay?

505
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:39,387
He's out of surgery,
and we've stopped the bleeding.

506
00:24:39,423 --> 00:24:40,814
What the hell happened?

507
00:24:42,392 --> 00:24:43,591
All I can tell you

508
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:45,193
is that your son was
involved in a shooting,

509
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:47,429
and that the bullet we removed
in order to save his life

510
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:50,498
was lodged dangerously close
his spinal cord.

511
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:52,333
There's still
a great deal of inflammation.

512
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:54,101
Can we see him?

513
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,103
Tomorrow at the earliest.

514
00:24:56,138 --> 00:24:57,171
So he's gonna be okay?

515
00:24:57,206 --> 00:25:00,140
I'm confident Trevor will survive this.

516
00:25:00,176 --> 00:25:01,509
He's very strong.

517
00:25:01,969 --> 00:25:03,377
But you should know
there's a possibility

518
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:05,779
he may not regain the use of his legs.

519
00:25:12,814 --> 00:25:14,814
How old was Taylor when his mother died?

520
00:25:16,536 --> 00:25:17,969
A baby.

521
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:24,057
I'd spent the latter half
of my life before this one

522
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:25,434
being eaten away

523
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,459
by a disease that doesn't exist yet.

524
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:31,340
I never imagined
the possibility of family.

525
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,801
A loving wife.

526
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,701
A child.

527
00:25:37,734 --> 00:25:39,734
Irene was convinced that I'd be angry

528
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:41,759
when she told me about the baby,

529
00:25:43,117 --> 00:25:45,117
afraid I'd think she'd trapped me.

530
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,313
But how could she know

531
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:51,469
that in the future I'd left behind,

532
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,470
life was so precious...

533
00:25:55,094 --> 00:25:57,094
And new life, so rare,

534
00:25:57,758 --> 00:25:59,528
most precious of all.

535
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:03,063
Just as she couldn't have known

536
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:05,749
that a stolen moment while I slept,

537
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:10,170
a small token of a perfect memory...

538
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,875
...would be the instrument of her death.

539
00:26:26,202 --> 00:26:27,915
An image of me, taken on a cell phone,

540
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,551
time and place recorded,

541
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:31,552
and posted to a friend,

542
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,592
discovered and acted upon.

543
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:35,550
Vincent, I think...

544
00:26:35,585 --> 00:26:37,348
You see, we knew it was possible

545
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:39,782
to send messages directly to the 21st

546
00:26:39,818 --> 00:26:40,850
through a host,

547
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:43,018
but we projected a 40% chance

548
00:26:43,054 --> 00:26:45,520
that an adult mind
might not be able to withstand

549
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:47,156
the shock of transfer.

550
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:50,359
That's the whole reason
I volunteered to go first!

551
00:26:50,394 --> 00:26:52,694
No one would have to die
that wasn't going to die...

552
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,004
Okay, let's just stop...

553
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,191
Artificial Intelligence
isn't supposed to be capable

554
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:57,932
of taking a life
that isn't about to end.

555
00:26:57,968 --> 00:26:59,000
The Director shouldn't have risked it,

556
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:00,001
don't you understand?

557
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,202
No!

558
00:27:01,238 --> 00:27:04,324
Not one part of what you just said.

559
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,396
I apologize.

560
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:16,417
Vincent, I can't help you

561
00:27:16,452 --> 00:27:19,073
if I don't understand
what you're saying.

562
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,789
Of course.

563
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:35,756
Hey, guys...

564
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,560
I just want to say,

565
00:27:40,877 --> 00:27:43,210
whatever happens from this point...

566
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,999
be proud of what you accomplished.

567
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:50,304
I still think,
in the grand scheme of things,

568
00:27:50,953 --> 00:27:52,686
we did good.

569
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:54,802
I know we did.

570
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:59,293
And I still have faith

571
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:01,315
the Director will find a way.

572
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:04,785
I believe that with all my heart.

573
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,468
Just...

574
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:11,090
...maybe not with us.

575
00:28:14,108 --> 00:28:16,208
You all know what you have to do.

576
00:28:19,086 --> 00:28:21,719
Boss, could you be
a little more specific?

577
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:25,473
Self-destruct.

578
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:27,753
Obviously.

579
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:29,796
What?

580
00:28:30,024 --> 00:28:31,712
In three...

581
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,894
Two...

582
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:39,052
One.

583
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:58,038
Sorry, Wakefield,

584
00:28:58,952 --> 00:29:00,808
you had that coming.

585
00:29:02,696 --> 00:29:04,562
Com 3468...

586
00:29:04,924 --> 00:29:06,091
disable.

587
00:29:06,126 --> 00:29:07,959
Com 3465, disable.

588
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:09,326
Com 3569,

589
00:29:09,362 --> 00:29:10,327
disable.

590
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:11,696
3326...

591
00:29:13,132 --> 00:29:14,298
disable.

592
00:29:17,236 --> 00:29:19,259
So long, you guys.

593
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:28,112
Well, that's my work day.

594
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:29,737
Text me if anything happens.

595
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,843
We've gone long past the time
I allotted for this visit.

596
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,766
I was wondering
if we could start fresh...

597
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,167
No, I...

598
00:30:26,202 --> 00:30:28,703
No, I'd rather you stay a little longer.

599
00:30:31,468 --> 00:30:32,933
Vincent, these delusions...

600
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:34,725
Memories.

601
00:30:35,972 --> 00:30:39,741
...Are a very complex product
of severe paranoia.

602
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:41,082
I can't...

603
00:30:41,117 --> 00:30:42,283
I told you they've found me twice.

604
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:43,558
"They."

605
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,194
The Director.

606
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,184
All right.

607
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,753
Tell me about the second time.

608
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,869
It was a year later.

609
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:58,139
The company had become
quite successful...

610
00:30:58,174 --> 00:30:59,908
You're not gonna believe
how well that meeting went.

611
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,209
Meeting?

612
00:31:01,244 --> 00:31:03,211
Yeah, with the venture capital
company, I told you.

613
00:31:03,246 --> 00:31:04,879
I told you it was a bad idea.

614
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:06,581
They made an offer.

615
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,812
- Now, I didn't commit...
- No...

616
00:31:08,847 --> 00:31:10,818
...because they want
your software, too, but...

617
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:11,972
No.

618
00:31:14,057 --> 00:31:16,824
$87 million!

619
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:19,057
Say no again, I dare you.

620
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,480
Oliver, I told you from the beginning.

621
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:22,172
I thought we were
supposed to be partners!

622
00:31:22,197 --> 00:31:23,663
This is my software.

623
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:24,866
I've told you,

624
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:27,133
if we affect the market
in any tangible way,

625
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:28,201
it just doesn't work.

626
00:31:28,237 --> 00:31:30,871
Yeah, okay, one, why is that?

627
00:31:30,906 --> 00:31:32,906
And-and two, who cares?

628
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:36,243
If we sell the company for 87 million?

629
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:38,746
I'm not taking "no" for an answer.

630
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,514
You're going to hear them out.

631
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:42,148
Oliver, wait. Wait!

632
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:52,880
There is no predictive software.

633
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:56,116
It doesn't exist, it never has.

634
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,491
All the computers out there,
the software,

635
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,288
it's just for show, it's a front.

636
00:32:02,303 --> 00:32:04,504
Then... how have you...

637
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,672
I'm doing it.

638
00:32:08,943 --> 00:32:12,712
No one could have guessed
large market trends

639
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:14,414
that accurately and that often.

640
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:16,548
That's true, I'm not guessing.

641
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,971
I'm remembering.

642
00:32:19,006 --> 00:32:21,320
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

643
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:25,424
It means you can't sell
the company, Oliver, I'm sorry.

644
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:29,694
You can't use that in here...

645
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:30,963
Yeah, I'm breaking the rules

646
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:32,898
because you're out of your mind!

647
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:35,434
If I had stayed silent,
he might have lived,

648
00:32:35,469 --> 00:32:38,437
but the FCC was investigating
the company,

649
00:32:38,472 --> 00:32:40,594
and they had tapped his phone.

650
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:44,142
Voice recognition and GPS
allowed them to find me

651
00:32:44,177 --> 00:32:45,811
the moment I spoke...

652
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:47,546
Oliver, please, I told you.

653
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,480
Stop, please, I told you,
it's dangerous.

654
00:32:49,515 --> 00:32:50,748
I said, stop!

655
00:32:58,825 --> 00:33:00,758
Traveler 001,

656
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:01,993
you are outside mission parameters.

657
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:03,761
Self-termination required immediately.

658
00:33:24,749 --> 00:33:27,184
First new message.

659
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:28,986
Walter, it's Kathryn again.

660
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:30,520
I'm at my mother's.

661
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:33,123
Please call me back.

662
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:48,031
_

663
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:06,081
Callahan,

664
00:34:06,116 --> 00:34:07,789
any idea what's up?

665
00:34:07,825 --> 00:34:10,059
Wakefield just sent me
a message to come here.

666
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:12,027
Yeah, most of us
all got the same message.

667
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:13,161
He does this.

668
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:26,340
Okay, here I am.

669
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:28,232
What's so important?

670
00:34:28,257 --> 00:34:29,162
I was going to ask you the same thing.

671
00:34:29,187 --> 00:34:30,447
You just texted me.

672
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:32,147
I what?

673
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,174
Yeah, me too.

674
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:08,966
So your business partner
also died of an aneurysm?

675
00:35:09,001 --> 00:35:09,967
Yes.

676
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:12,402
And you became sole owner
of the company.

677
00:35:12,438 --> 00:35:13,503
Yes.

678
00:35:14,973 --> 00:35:16,440
You think I killed them.

679
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,701
I told you, it was the Director.

680
00:35:25,718 --> 00:35:28,117
You have nothing
to be afraid of, Dr. Perrow.

681
00:35:28,595 --> 00:35:30,119
I feel so much better

682
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:33,957
having unpacked myself
of all that baggage.

683
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:39,295
I feel nothing but gratitude.

684
00:35:40,332 --> 00:35:41,675
Great.

685
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:45,968
Well, if you don't mind,
I'll be, uh, heading home.

686
00:35:46,003 --> 00:35:47,035
My daughter will be wondering...

687
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,937
Of course, I've kept you too long.

688
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:51,841
And your cell phone
and payment, in cash,

689
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:53,075
is ready outside.

690
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:57,057
And I'd like to schedule
another appointment, please.

691
00:36:03,666 --> 00:36:04,832
Vincent...

692
00:36:06,196 --> 00:36:07,601
you need medication.

693
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:10,025
I'm not helping.

694
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,672
Of course you are.

695
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:14,475
It doesn't even matter
that you don't believe me.

696
00:36:15,499 --> 00:36:17,399
I get to talk to someone

697
00:36:17,434 --> 00:36:22,069
who affords me the privacy
of doctor-client privilege,

698
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:24,351
and you get paid a great deal of money.

699
00:36:25,409 --> 00:36:28,655
It really is the ultimate
21st-Century arrangement.

700
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:45,506
Grace?

701
00:36:46,296 --> 00:36:47,261
Shh!

702
00:36:47,297 --> 00:36:48,762
I had to sneak in here.

703
00:36:48,798 --> 00:36:50,497
What are you doing?

704
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:51,498
I'm sharing

705
00:36:51,534 --> 00:36:53,233
the medical nanites I was given by D-13

706
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:54,868
so that you'll be able to walk again.

707
00:36:54,904 --> 00:36:55,869
I heard them talking.

708
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:57,438
Oh.

709
00:36:57,473 --> 00:36:58,705
Thank you.

710
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:00,106
You're welcome.

711
00:37:00,142 --> 00:37:01,842
It's going to quadruple
my recovery time,

712
00:37:01,877 --> 00:37:04,077
but I suppose you're worth it.

713
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:06,226
So there's no sweet
nanotech for me again?

714
00:37:06,982 --> 00:37:08,448
The Director left me out?

715
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:11,117
You've lived longer
than any human in history,

716
00:37:11,153 --> 00:37:12,452
and you're complaining?

717
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:15,269
I'm starting to take it personally.

718
00:37:21,341 --> 00:37:23,895
Wait, don't medical nanites
need to be programmed

719
00:37:23,931 --> 00:37:25,364
to do specific tasks?

720
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:27,566
Yes, and I am a...?

721
00:37:27,601 --> 00:37:29,016
Programmer.

722
00:37:29,603 --> 00:37:31,069
Oh, yeah.

723
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:34,005
I'm sorry, I'm all drugged up.

724
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,373
I got shot.

725
00:37:36,643 --> 00:37:38,810
I stepped in front of you, remember?

726
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:43,181
Oh, wow, you did.

727
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:46,284
Thank you for saving me, Grace...

728
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:48,052
Okay, now shut up and heal.

729
00:37:48,088 --> 00:37:50,088
I need to concentrate.

730
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:03,167
Walt, I-I thought...

731
00:38:03,203 --> 00:38:05,686
I'm Traveler 4112.

732
00:38:07,707 --> 00:38:09,406
I'm sorry,

733
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:11,742
I know he was a friend.

734
00:38:11,777 --> 00:38:12,943
How?

735
00:38:12,979 --> 00:38:16,146
0014 built the Quantum Frame
with a fail-safe,

736
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:17,681
one that would level
this entire building

737
00:38:17,717 --> 00:38:20,367
the moment Wakefield
and his team opened it up.

738
00:38:21,387 --> 00:38:23,253
Which made all of you host candidates.

739
00:38:23,737 --> 00:38:25,455
I heard it happening. How many?

740
00:38:25,491 --> 00:38:27,790
25 of us in the gym,
including Wakefield.

741
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:28,791
What about the...

742
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:29,792
The Quantum Frame,

743
00:38:29,828 --> 00:38:31,378
it's being dismantled and scrapped.

744
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:35,999
So, that's it?

745
00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:38,968
That's it. It's over, Grant.

746
00:38:40,972 --> 00:38:43,540
Mac. You call me "Mac."

747
00:38:43,575 --> 00:38:46,160
They shorten everything for some reason.

748
00:38:46,878 --> 00:38:47,844
Mac...

749
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:50,914
I'm gonna need your help
with a Lotta things.

750
00:38:52,183 --> 00:38:54,435
Welcome to the 21st.

751
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:20,275
Thank you.

752
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:41,162
Do you really think it's ethical

753
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:42,530
to plant a bomb,

754
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:44,364
and then take over the people
who would have died

755
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,666
when that bomb went off?

756
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,335
How is that not circular reasoning?

757
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,571
No way the Director would
allow that level of technology

758
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:51,872
in the 21st.

759
00:39:51,908 --> 00:39:53,708
The Director was the one
who had it ordered built

760
00:39:53,743 --> 00:39:54,775
in the first place...

761
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:55,910
Hey...

762
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:57,444
a wise man once told me,

763
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,479
take the win.

764
00:39:58,999 --> 00:40:00,280
Hey.

765
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:02,682
They wouldn't tell me much,

766
00:40:02,718 --> 00:40:04,017
but I got a quick look at the monitors

767
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:06,353
at the nursing station, and...

768
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:08,489
they're both going to recover.

769
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,479
Well, I'll take that win, too.

770
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:15,249
Come on, everybody, I'll drop you home.

771
00:40:15,731 --> 00:40:17,418
I think I'm gonna stay.

772
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,787
He would.

773
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:30,297
I've decided I'm not gonna kill you.

774
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,213
Oh.

775
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:35,269
Good.

776
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:37,971
I was gonna ask.

777
00:40:38,753 --> 00:40:39,718
I mean, there must have been

778
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:40,986
some kind of power struggle
back and forth

779
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,643
when all that was goin' down.

780
00:40:44,325 --> 00:40:46,246
Who knows where the order
came from, right?

781
00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:49,394
Well, at least it's settled now.

782
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,419
Still...

783
00:40:53,554 --> 00:40:55,534
it must have been hard for you.

784
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:05,377
Thanks for the lift.

785
00:41:19,452 --> 00:41:20,919
David...

786
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:24,451
It's the middle of the night.

787
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,854
It won't come out.

788
00:41:28,649 --> 00:41:31,512
I mean, you'd think
they'd properly clean up

789
00:41:31,537 --> 00:41:32,622
something like this, you know?

790
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:33,971
All those people here,

791
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:36,396
every one of them capable
of holding a mop.

792
00:41:37,164 --> 00:41:38,696
But nah, they're just gonna leave a...

793
00:41:39,078 --> 00:41:40,511
a giant blood stain

794
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:41,945
and a business card

795
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,514
with the number of a cleaning service.

796
00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:45,449
I'm surprised they
took away the dead body.

797
00:41:45,484 --> 00:41:48,275
I'm sorry that
you had to go through that.

798
00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:52,323
He was a John Doe by the way,

799
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:54,525
which I found fascinating.

800
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,226
Yeah, not just no I.D.,

801
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:57,751
no record at all.

802
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:01,664
But you probably already knew that.

803
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:06,593
Ray's a heck of a nice guy.

804
00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:08,138
Here, let me help...

805
00:42:08,173 --> 00:42:10,073
Nah, I got it. I'm trying, uh,

806
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:11,598
I'm trying baking soda.

807
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,009
You know, the good news is,

808
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:16,512
apparently, the Indian lady
that lives next door,

809
00:42:16,548 --> 00:42:18,314
whose name I never knew,

810
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,541
told an Officer Boyd,

811
00:42:21,419 --> 00:42:23,653
whose name I do remember
for some reason,

812
00:42:23,688 --> 00:42:25,988
that the person
that came into her apartment

813
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:30,284
was a stocky bald man
with a thick Canadian accent.

814
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,898
Those Canadians, man,

815
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:37,699
you gotta watch out.

816
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,202
But I'm sure you knew
all about that, too.

817
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:41,203
David, here...

818
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:42,204
David, stop, stop...

819
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,572
Now all I have to do

820
00:42:43,607 --> 00:42:45,440
is make myself available
for future questioning,

821
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:46,508
whatever that means.

822
00:42:46,543 --> 00:42:47,643
That's good.

823
00:42:47,678 --> 00:42:49,670
Oh, it's wonderful.

824
00:42:55,452 --> 00:42:57,051
Can I do anything?

825
00:42:57,478 --> 00:42:59,513
Can I make you some tea?

826
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:02,816
Um...

827
00:43:03,593 --> 00:43:05,359
You know, I've had about 57 cups,

828
00:43:05,395 --> 00:43:08,396
so I'm... I'm a little wired.

829
00:43:12,002 --> 00:43:13,861
What can I do?

830
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:19,066
This is nice.

831
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:24,144
Why don't you take the bed tonight,

832
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,340
I'll take the couch, okay?

833
00:43:27,784 --> 00:43:30,077
You know, I think I will tonight?

834
00:43:30,953 --> 00:43:32,212
I'm really tired.

835
00:43:33,923 --> 00:43:35,588
Okay.

836
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,512
So, how was work?

837
