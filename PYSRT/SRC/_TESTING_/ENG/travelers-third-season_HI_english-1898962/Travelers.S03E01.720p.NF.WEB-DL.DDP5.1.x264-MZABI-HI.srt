You can scream at the top of your lungs,
they're not gonna wake up for hours.

Yeah, but Carly's baby might.

11
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:14,950
The kid just settled down.
He's been traumatized enough.

12
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,498
It'll work out, boss.

13
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,416
Sure it will.

14
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,132
Maybe we should go over our story
one more time.

Not for my sake, obviously.

Vincent, where are you?

[Perrow]<i> I'm right here, Simon.
Can you hear me?</i>

<i>I've given you a comm.</i>

<i>Now close your eyes.
That's the most important rule.</i>

22
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,043
<i>Good. Make sure they stay closed.</i>

23

just what we're going to do.</i>

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,267
I did what you said!
Multiple uses, multiple transfers!

31
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,354
<i>And it's going to be put to good use,
I promise.</i>

00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,229
<i>You've done well.</i>

00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,315
I'm cold.

Oh, Jesus, keep it down a bit, man.

- How did I get here?
- I took your keys.

00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,332
Made you crash.

59
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,833
You were "celebrating."

Well, I must've had a good time, Phil,
'cause...

00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,720
I don't remember how I got here
or what we were celebrating.

62
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:07,349
You were in trouble with a loan shark,
uh, named Varghese.

63
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,227
Oh, right.

64
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,521
I got picked up by a couple of his boys.

65
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,124
I don't remember what happened after that.

66
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,308
Well, they gave you 24 hours
to come up with the money.

67
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,736
You came to me,
asked me to place some bets,

68
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,531
we came here to watch them come in
and hilarity ensued.

00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,742
- You really don't remember?
- No.

70
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,453
I maybe forgot to tell you
I probably shouldn't drink.

you're out of the hole
with a little extra.

74

Oh, I owe Varghese more than this.

75
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,718
Well, he's been paid.
That's... That's the extra.

Please, take a seat.

First, let me say
how sorry I am for your loss.

85
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,903
- I know from experience.
- Thank you, sir.

86
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,196
I'm fine.

87
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
[Stevenson] Good.

88
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,536
Then please explain your request
that I issue a cancellation order

89
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,248
of a highly classified,
highly complex operation

90
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,709
of which you should have had
zero knowledge

91
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,713
and which is scheduled to begin
worldwide in 23 minutes?

92
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,592
The request isn't mine, sir.
It's from the Director.

93
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,970
- He is the FBI director.
- Last I checked.

94
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:12,474
I think everyone in this room knows
to which director I'm referring.

95
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,312
How was this communicated to you?

96
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,022
It began several days ago.

97
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,899
And you waited until now?

98
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,861
Sir, if I can explain my reasoning
for not coming to you sooner.

99
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,782
Go ahead, Agent Yates.
Start at the beginning.

100
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,704
[Philip]<i> Boss, Ray is taken care of.</i>

101
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,957
So the memory inhibitor worked.

102
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:38,750
He was the easy one.

103
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,293
[Philip]<i> That and the cash.</i>

104
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,004
Now you can get back
to cleaning up our mess.

105
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,464
- <i>On it.</i>
- Tanner.

106
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,547
Mac.

107
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:48,468
Lot of people here,
they can't all be Travelers.

108
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,302
Nowhere near.

109
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,014
But Wakefield handpicked them,
they're good agents.

110
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,354
[door opens]

111
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,608
- How's it going up there?
- Same as 20 minutes ago.

112
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:06,861
David and Jeff are just taking a break
to get some medical attention.

113
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,781
- I thought we'd be on by now.
- These things take time.

114
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,282
Maybe you could go for a walk.

115
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:12,826
We just did.

116
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,704
Then go for another walk because
we're having a private conversation.

117
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,206
Sorry to interrupt.

118
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,084
Where were we?

119
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,129
- I think we were done.
- No, no, no. Um...

120
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,215
We were talking about your... feelings.

121
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,718
- You were talking about my feelings.
- Right.

122
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,511
The logic's inescapable.

123
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,889
001 kidnapped every significant other
on your team.

124
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,683
Mnh-mnh. Philip and Ray?

125
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,476
- Oh, I don't judge.
- Yeah, you do.

126
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,728
- Look, Trev.
- Trev?

127
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,439
[whispers] It's obvious I was taken
by 001,

128
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,442
held against my will,
and frankly starved.

129
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,461
We were only given water
for what seemed like days.

130
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:48,319
Thirty-one hours.

131
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:53,116
Because of the inevitable impact
it was gonna have on you... emotionally.

132
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,371
I'm important to you
in a way neither one of us foresaw.

133
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,331
And the sooner we both accept that...

134
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,126
Grace,

135
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:08,173
I am delighted you were the one kidnapped
and interrogated, not my parents.

136
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,550
There, I said it. So...

137
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,636
That is the second nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

138
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,221
So can I go now?

139
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,141
Oh, no, no, no. Your team needs you.

140
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,185
I'll go.

141
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,314
Oh.

142
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,483
It's thrilling, isn't it?

143
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,613
The primal rush of hormones
bursting from your endocrine system.

144
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,409
Remember we're much, much older
than these bodies.

145
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,787
[whispers] And I can't wait
to try them out.

146
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,835
[door opens]

147

[door closes]

148

[Carly] You train for years
to be a part of the grand plan.

149
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,723
Studied medicine.

150
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,265
Combat.

151
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:04,395
Finally, you get assigned a team
over hundreds of other volunteers.

152
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,856
And all you can think about
is your boyfriend.

153
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,281
I hope I never see Jeff again.

154
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,202
You can still make work.
He won't remember the last 24 hours.

155
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,639
Please. They're gonna need to forget
a hell of a lot more than that

156
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,872
and you know it, Marcy.

157
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,499
It's what we've got to work with.

158
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,876
They'll definitely remember
being abducted.

159
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,128
Meeting each other.

160
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,891
Maybe even their first session
with Perrow.

161
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,315
How do we even know
she'll cooperate?

162
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:35,093
She's already made a statement
saying that her actions were under duress.

163
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,936
Beyond that,
she wants nothing to do with us.

164
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,179
Frankly, I don't blame her.

165
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,406
As far as Perrow's concerned,

166
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,933
Vincent Ingram
was a deeply paranoid serial killer

167
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,696
who thought that time travelers
from the future were out to get him.

168
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,104
Crazy talk.

169
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,315
Fortunately, no mainstream news outlet's
taking it seriously.

170
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,485
And once the new Traveler in Ingram
confesses he went off his meds...

171
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,988
Yeah, but, see, you make it
sound ridiculous.

172
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,949
Hey, I'm from the future,
I'm not sure I buy it myself.

173
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,951
Jeff sure as hell believed it.

174
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,203
So did David.

175
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,790
- No. What is that? What is that?
- Let go of me.

176
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,000
[Carly]<i> So did your wife.</i>

177
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,756
Which is why we have to make sure
our stories are straight.

178
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,884
So we can all get back to our Protocol 5.

179
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,386
- Oh! This is about Protocol 5?
- That is the mission.

180
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,869
Oh, now you care about the mission.

181
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,556
What is that supposed to mean?

182
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,267
You risked the entire Traveler program...

183
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,476
for her.

184
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,187
And you did the same.

185
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,399
What do you think,
you can just undo all of this?

186
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,861
- Just put it all back into a box?
- We try! Yes!

187
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,031
Shit was about to hit the fan
anyway, Carly.

188
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,951
Exposure was imminent across every major
intelligence agency worldwide:

189
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,787
CIA, FSB, Interpol.

190
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,124
All we did was speed up the process.

191
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,394
- Then we need to move.
- No. The Director sent us here.

192
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,338
The Director has been making it up
as it goes along, Marcy.

193
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,382
- I think it's about time we all admit...
- Keep your fucking voice down.

194
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,818
The point is, what happened was inevitable

195
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:07,060
and obviously there's now a plan in motion
to deal with that.

196
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,520
Meantime, we stick to the protocols.

197
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:16,341
You gonna order me to stay with him?

198
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,712
You gonna tell me what the bruising
on your knuckles is all about?

199
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,787
[Trevor stammers] Hey, guys!
Grace just left.

200
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,705
I was about to rustle up some lunch.

201
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,041
I do a mean veggie stir fry, boss.

202
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,461
Does it have to be mean? [sighs]

203
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,255
[Kathryn] I just wanna go home!

204
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:37,816
[Wakefield] And we're gonna take you home.

205
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,885
But you've been kidnapped,
held against your will,

206
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:41,970
probably brainwashed.

207
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,931
Apparently by a man I met
at a charity auction a decade ago,

208
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,724
as if that makes any sense.

209
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,353
At least tell me some things
I wanna know.

210
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,314
Like, where are we?
And how long have I been in these clothes?

211
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:57,902
An FBI safe house in the country,
and... a couple days.

212
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,738
Kathryn, you were found unconscious
yesterday

213
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,740
in a room with four other people:

214
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,535
David Mailer, Jeff Conniker,
Ray Green and...

215
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,413
- All of them claimed to know my husband.
- There. See?

216
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,038
New information.

217
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,583
Exactly why we have to keep
talking this through.

218
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,186
You've been through a traumatic ordeal

219
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,463
and without proper debriefing,
you could suffer long-term consequences.

220
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:18,673
This is what we do

221
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,592
if something like this happens
to any one of our agents in the field.

222
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,638
What's the first thing you remember
about the abduction?

223
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,932
His men...

224
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,601
They were twins.

225
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,353
Also new information.

226
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,774
We woke up in a room with five chairs.

227
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:40,528
And then they took us out one by one
to talk a woman.

228
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,155
- A doctor.
- Dr. Perrow.

229
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,782
- Yes.
- She was there against her will, too.

230
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,035
Oh, God, they have her daughter.

231
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,371
- They're fine, we've been in contact.
- Oh, that poor woman.

232
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,539
[grunts]

233
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,085
You know what, that's it,
that's all I remember.

234
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,006
Why did they drug me?

235
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:05,344
To move you to another location.
It's lucky MacLaren found you.

236
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,428
[sighs]

237
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,449
We can give you something
for the headache.

238
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,193
No. I don't like to take pills.
Can I see him now? Is Grant here yet?

239
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,186
He's here and you will see him very soon.

240
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,774
But first, I need you to go over
one more time

241
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,609
what you talked about in that room.

242
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,862
Hey! I need a ride,
who's the lucky driver?

243
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,988
[thuds]

244
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,448
The bus is for the 21sters.

245
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,743
Fine, let me take that one.

246
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,289
- Parsons, we need a driver, over.
- [sighs]

247
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,578
Parsons, what's your status?

248
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,170
How's your vision in this eye?

249
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,506
Well, can I see out of it? Yes.

250
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,926
Can I feel my pulse in it? Also yes.

251
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,513
[Doctor] Swelling's down, won't be pretty.

252
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,682
[David] When I was a kid,
I got a black eye

253
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,643
the day before high school started.

254
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,938
My mom said to tell everybody:
"You should see the other guy!"

255
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,397
[chuckles]

256
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,051
You're not the other guy, are you?

257
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,362
If it was me, you'd look a lot worse.

258
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,281
Yeah, okay.
Well, maybe you should look in the mirror.

259
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,578
He's at the roadblock down the road
a ways, his radio battery must be dead.

260
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,391
Never mind, I'll walk to him,
I've been cramped up for days without...

261
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,582
You don't care.

262
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,334
[indistinct radio chatter]

263
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,507
We good to keep going?

264
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,801
All yours.

265
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,764
I'm not talking to no one else
until someone shows me my son.

266
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,350
I told you, Jeff Jr.
is being well taken care of.

267
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,727
And I told you that that is unacceptable.

268
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,856
So is your attitude, Officer Conniker.

269
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,025
Okay, why don't you give the guy a break,
we were kidnapped for chrissake.

270
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,610
And I don't need your help neither.

271
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,947
Come with me, Mr. Mailer.

272
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,634
[Jeff] Maybe ask him
why he's sleeping with the girl

273
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,076
who's in the care of the state.

274
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,626
[knocks on door]

275
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:17,643
[knocking continues]

276
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:27,903
Simon?

277
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,114
Traveler 5069.

278
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,450
You knew my host?

279
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:34,201
Uh...

280
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,078
Yeah, I did.

281
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:40,374
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised Simon's
death wasn't in the historical record.

282
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,544
My host was supposed to be
a John Doe, attempted suicide,

283
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,088
but obviously he was a Traveler.

284
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,049
Have you ever seen a comm do this?

285
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,886
Ouch.

286
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,746
Let me get you something for that.

287
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,307
Someone tried to speak to him.
I couldn't hear over the train.

288
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,809
It wasn't just any Traveler, he was 004.

289
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,255
Didn't know he had a comm, though.

290
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,987
There's some things you need to know
about him.

291
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,317
First things first.

292
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,736
We need to reactivate
that code you embedded

293
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,989
in those obscene
confession recordings you made, ASAP.

294
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,390
- What were you people thinking anyway?
- [keyboard clacking]

295
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,954
I was thinking that we could locate
and erase the recordings

296
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,455
before they got out into the world,

297
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,123
but Vincent had countermeasures.

298
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,835
Of course the Director would have devised
a countermeasure for 001.

299
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,756
The Director can calculate in seconds
what would take a lifetime for you or I.

300
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,510
I find... your lack of fealty offensive.

301
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,889
This body is dehydrated,
do you have water?

302
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,560
[clacking continues]

303
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,898
You should know,

304
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,236
your host body suffers from extreme
paranoid schizophrenia.

305
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,073
Severe enough that our medic
couldn't synthesize a drug to prevent it.

306
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,327
Simon was pretty much incapable
of functioning in 21st society,

307
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,662
let alone as a Traveler.

308
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,624
You'll probably experience a psychotic
episode in the next few hours.

309
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:09,297
That's the body...

310
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,550
the Director chose for you.

311
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,104
David, I know it's complicated...

312
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,523
No, no, no. What's not to get?

313
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,835
This Vincent Ingram character
had it in for Agent MacLaren

314
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,904
because MacLaren was onto his whole
torturing people in wheelchairs

315
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,132
and burying 'em alive fetish,

316
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:39,118
so Ingram kidnaps,
drugs and/or beats the crap out of anyone

317
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,078
who's close to Agent MacLaren,

318
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:44,081
with the likely intention
of, you know, doing the same to us.

319
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,000
- That's pretty much it.
- Right.

320
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,503
Except I'm not even remotely close
to Agent MacLaren.

321
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,130
In fact, I don't think he likes me.

322
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:52,822
He hasn't said he doesn't like you.

323
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,133
[stammers] You know what?

324
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,385
Mac and me,
we are just two different kinds of guys,

325
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,638
just one is no less manly than the other.

326
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,724
Just two different kinds of manly men.

327
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,309
- David.
- On the other hand,

328
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,687
if this is the new normal,
then I better buck up a little bit.

329
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,147
- You know what I mean?
- No.

330
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,399
Yeah. [stutters]
I better grow a pair of kahunas.

331
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,628
I'm pretty sure that's not the word,
but I'm gonna go with it,

332
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,279
because if I'm gonna hang out
with an FBI doctor,

333
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:18,157
I better pack on some muscle,
you know, maybe do some,

334
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,451
like, what is it,
is this Taekwondo, Pilates?

335
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,578
David, calm down.

336
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,373
Agent Callahan...

337
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,250
I have never been more calm in my life.

338
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,421
[birds chirping]

339
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,590
Hello?

340
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,055
Hello?

341
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:43,808
Hello?

342
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,535
Are you people seriously
gonna make me walk

343
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,279
- the rest of...
- Hands on the vehicle now!

344
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,854
- What the hell...?
- Turn around

345
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:51,190
and put your hands on the vehicle
or we'll take you down!

346
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,240
[man over radio]
<i>Don't let her touch the comm!</i>

347
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:54,902
This is drop leader 31...

348
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,964
One of the primaries attempted
to leave containment on foot,

349
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,198
we have her in custody.

350
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,450
[phone rings]

351
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,496
This is Deputy Oslin. Yes?

352
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:09,369
All right. Keep us apprised.

353
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,254
We just captured
the Traveler designated 0027

354
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,937
attempting to escape before the assault.

355
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,007
Did she activate her comm device?

356
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,592
If she has one, she didn't try.

357
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:19,802
Then we're still on.

358
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,389
You were saying
the Director communicated to you?

359
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,516
Yes, it spoke to me.

360
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,934
[scoffs] That's not possible.

361
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,562
The Director is only
capable of communicating directly

362
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,355
through what they call "messengers."

363
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,606
Specifically, children.

364
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,526
Because for reasons we don't know,
the process kills an adult.

365
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,696
Apparently, it found another way.

366
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,663
Dr. Teslia?

367
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,417
Dr. Teslia?

368
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:52,877
Yes.

369
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:55,838
Hi.

370
00:20:58,841 --> 00:20:59,841
And you're...?

371
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,154
The person you called
and insisted I come here

372
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,363
as a matter of national security.

373
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,597
I just forgot your name.

374
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,808
- Special Agent...
- Yates, yes, I knew that.

375
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:08,893
So...

376
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,686
Come, come.

377
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,854
So...

378
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,148
This is Ilsa.

379
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,733
And Ilsa, this is...

380
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,401
Uh, what's your first name again?

381
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,195
<i>Good evening, Dr. Teslia.</i>

382
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,280
<i>Would you like to play
a nice game of chess?</i>

383
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,363
[snorts, chuckles]

384
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:25,618
No one ever gets that. Okay.

385
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:31,540
Ilsa is AI that replaces Boolean logic
with quantum law on an algorithmic level.

386
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:34,585
There's maybe three others
as powerful in the whole world.

387
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,337
It gave you my cell number?

388
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,674
No. No, Ilsa is practically a newborn.
The Director gave me your number.

389
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,592
What Director?

390
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,345
That is the question.

391
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,015
All right, we're done.

392
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,560
[Director]<i> I am very sorry
for your mother's diagnosis, Joanne.</i>

393
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,484
I just heard the news myself.
How would it know that?

394
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,612
That's the Director talking now.

395
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,448
It's taking over Ilsa to communicate.

396
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,551
[Director]<i> You were chosen
among seven potential candidates</i>

397
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,952
<i>within this jurisdiction.</i>

398
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,664
Okay, who are you?

399
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,416
<i>A sentient multi-zettaflop
quantum frame</i>

400
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,877
<i>speaking to you
from centuries in the future.</i>

401
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,712
[Yates sighs]

402
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,340
Matter of national security...

403
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,676
<i>- ...only recently possible because of...</i>
- Okay, stop!

404
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,096
I don't know if this is some kind of joke
or you're trying to sell me something,

405
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,349
but either way, you picked the wrong
person on the wrong goddamn day.

406
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,934
Agent Yates... [stammers]

407
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,354
Call me again and I'll arrest you.

408
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,773
I take it he called you again.

409
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,276
[Yates] Actually, he sent me a text.

410
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,237
It just didn't make sense
until the next day...

411
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,575
[Dr. Sheppard] I was about to head out.
Maybe you should do the same.

412
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,453
Oh, I, um...

413
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,582
I wanna be here in case she wakes up.

414
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,798
Joanne... this last stroke was extensive.

415
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,508
She won't be waking up again.

416
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,347
Well, I spoke to her
the day before yesterday.

417
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,191
Here. Might as well
have something to read.

418
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,704
How could you know?

419
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,749
- What?
- You texted me yesterday.

420
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,476
- How did you know this would happen?
- I didn't!

421
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,794
I just texted
what the Director told me to text.

422
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,714
- Wow.
- Well, I wanna talk to the Director.

423
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,090
Yeah? Well, get in line!

424
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:48,552
I tried to all last night,
it wouldn't say a word to me.

425
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:49,916
[Director] <i>Good morning, Joanne.</i>

00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,139
Dude, I'm standing right here.

00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,182
How did you know?

00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:57,645
[Director] <i>From my time, the bird strike

<i>- Have I convinced you?
- </i>No.

432
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:06,320
What do you want from me?

433
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,506
[Director] <i>To deliver a message
to your superiors.</i>

434
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,530
Tell them yourself.

00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,826
[Director] <i>I have no means of directly
communicating outside of this room.</i>

436
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:17,581
Ilsa is built inside an AI box,
it's completely cut off.

437
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,793
You can't just give a potentially emerging
super-intelligence the car keys.

438
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,461
You need to control what it learns.

439
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,673
What's the message?

440
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,008
[Director] <i>Your superiors
must order the cancellation</i>

441
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:32,096
<i>of the coordinated assault planned
tomorrow on Traveler teams worldwide</i>

442
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,766
<i>or face an unstoppable series
of civilization ending events.</i>

443
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:39,687
<i>Discovery was inevitable
at this juncture of the grand plan.</i>

444
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:44,400
<i>Cooperation with the 21st century
authorities is now the optimal path.</i>

445
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,403
You get that?

446
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,534
[Oslin] <i>And you just left?</i>

447
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:58,247
Deputy Oslin, did you believe in time
travelers the first time you were told?

448
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,581
Truthfully, no.

449
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,436
I reluctantly told the agent
who brought it to me

450
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,629
that he could pursue the matter,
but you're right,

451
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,588
I didn't believe him.

452
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,298
- How did he convince you?
- [Stevenson] He didn't.

453
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:14,012
The agent was overwritten
along with his entire task force.

454
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,660
- [machine explodes]
- [crowd screams]

455
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,812
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

456
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,498
[Stevenson] Special Agent Wakefield
told us

457
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,667
he was on the verge
of providing the proof he needed...

458
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:28,485
[Oslin] The next day,
he was a different man. Literally.

459
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,779
The man I had worked alongside
for ten years

460
00:25:30,863 --> 00:25:32,740
had been replaced by an impostor.

461
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,824
How?

462
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,034
[Stevenson] A traveler
supplants a host consciousness

463
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,455
with his or her own,
then pretends as if nothing's changed.

464
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,665
When Wakefield called us
that evening

465
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,501
ostensibly to assure me that his task
force had found nothing,

466
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,004
we knew he'd become one of them.

467
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,216
I take it the Director didn't share
that information with you.

468
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,886
No.

469
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:59,516
It's how they come here
from their own time. It's... insidious.

470
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,934
It's murder.

471
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,062
And the reason this operation
must continue on schedule,

472
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:06,398
however much you try
to convince us otherwise.

473
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,487
- You don't think that I'm...?
- Never met you before, Agent Yates.

474
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,989
How would we know?

475
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,623
[Trevor] Seasoned with exotic spices
from all around the world.

476
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,375
- Ellis had a whole rack of 'em.
- Thanks, Trev.

477
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,305
[footsteps approaching]

478
00:26:38,764 --> 00:26:40,891
Hey, wanted to give you an update on...

479
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:44,144
Oh. Uh, I haven't eaten in hours,
would you mind if...?

480
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,271
[stutters] Be my guest.

481
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,023
[clears throat]

482
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,528
[sighs]

483
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:56,864
Mm.

484
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,828
Mm, this is amazing.

485
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,870
What spice is that?

486
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,081
All of them.

487
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,083
Mm.

488
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,085
- You mentioned an update?
- Right.

489
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,381
Okay, so we, uh,
we think we're in the clear

490
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,843
as far as the recordings
are concerned across the board.

491
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:19,137
Obviously, they're still traumatized,
but the inhibitor wiped the worst of it.

492
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,015
Who knows how David's gonna handle this?

493
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,518
David's fine. He's chatty...

494
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:25,977
Uh-oh.

495
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,789
He and Kathryn
will be ready for you soon.

496
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,482
But, uh, Jeff's a different story...

497
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,006
Your medic is worried that
he's resistant to memory inhibitor.

498
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,362
He's an alcoholic.

499
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,615
I gave him a stronger dose to compensate,
but his tolerance may be high.

500
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,161
Well, whatever, we gotta
release him anyway. Protocol 3.

501
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,476
He, uh, he doesn't wanna talk to you.

502
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,332
Fine by me.

503
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,752
- He does wanna speak with you.
- Huh.

504
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,716
Also, I'm, uh, I'm down a couple of
Traveler agents driving your people home.

505
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,902
Can you spare anyone to keep an eye
on the back of the property?

506
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:58,969
We can spare me.

507
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,679
Yeah, you can spare me, too.

508
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,931
[clears throat]

509
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,392
Mm.

510
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,645
[agent] <i>Agent 443.</i>

511
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,275
Keep your comms open.

512
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,819
[indistinct radio chatter]

513
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,704
Jeff, I am so sorry
you got caught up in this.

514
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,124
I'd been investigating Vincent Ingram
for some time, and unfortunately...

515
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,959
Yeah, yeah, they told me all about it.

516
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,754
It all went down
because I'm close to Carly

517
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,589
and Carly's close to you.

518
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,716
So how close?

519
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,471
Okay. You want the truth?

520
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,183
Ms. Shannon has been working for me.

521
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,601
- The FBI?
- Yes.

522
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,145
[chuckles] Carly Shannon, FBI.

523
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,898
- For several months.
- [chuckles] I don't think so.

524
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,277
'Cause she... she don't got it in her.
Not my Carly.

525
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,822
But then again, my Carly's gone.

526
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,576
Because this girl, this girl's not Carly.

527
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,662
This girl's a completely different person.

528
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,205
And I don't know what you did...

529
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,483
but I don't like her much no more.

530
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,795
Judging by the condition of your face,
she doesn't like you much either.

531
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,588
[laughs] That is funny.

532
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,507
Well, least we can laugh about it.

533
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,553
No, I don't want anything to do
with this girl, you can have her.

534
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,240
You sure?
'Cause I think she missed a spot.

535
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,264
- Keep it up.
- You're the one that wanted to talk.

536
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,894
I wanted you to know

537
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,273
that I remember things that
I didn't tell your boy upstairs about.

538
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,859
It's not all there yet.
Not all at once.

539
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,696
Just itty bitty pieces percolating

540
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,823
like the morning after
a night you been drinking.

541
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,242
Well, you'd know more about that
than I would.

542
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,326
But it'll come to me...

543
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,413
it will.

544
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:02,718
[Trevor] And the only thing that you need
to make it happen from there

545
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,346
is sunlight and water.
Food just rises up from the soil.

546
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,850
It's beautiful when you think about it,
you know. How...

547
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,603
Nothing out here.

548
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:15,688
Yeah, let's head back.

549
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,658
[engine revving]

550
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,498
- [Carly] <i>We're being surveilled.
- </i>By who?

551
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,419
Can't say who or how many,
but we saw some footprints.

552
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,504
Footprints, that's it?

553
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,466
We need to get proper reinforcements
and take them out.

554
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:46,345
Take them out?
What if it's nosy next door neighbors?

555
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,808
Wakefield's got a small army protecting
us, Carly. Dial it back a little.

556
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:29,221
One of the secondaries just passed through
the checkpoint. It's the cop.

557
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,608
[Oslin] <i>We'll get the driver
at the same time we get their historian.</i>

Not recycled 10,000 times.

00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:48,907
Well, I'm done.

563
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,578
The Director's code should allow
traveler teams to identify every copy

564
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,872
of your ill-conceived confessions
that's out there.

- Thanks.
- [sighs]

566
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,836
Although, the effort
hardly seems worth it.

567
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,422
No one from the 21st
would actually believe that...

568
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,715
[Philip] What's wrong?

569
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,471
I, uh, thought that I saw...

570
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,560
Maybe I'm exhausted.
Was your transition here tiring?

571
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:20,147
Well, I was going through
heroin withdrawal, so...

572
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,191
How could you leave me behind like this?

573
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:24,985
I was assigned a mission.

574
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,611
You ran away.

575
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,198
- No.
- Because things are getting worse here.

576
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,825
I'm trying to save you!

577
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,746
It's already too late for me.

578
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,331
Simon?

579
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,252
What are you looking at?

580
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,630
My friend's not really there, is he?

581
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,131
No. We're alone.

582
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,306
Why would the Director do this to me?

583
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,146
It makes mistakes just like us.

584
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,944
Come on, you gotta try the food.

585
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,622
Carly and Trevor think
we're being surveilled.

586
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,794
- Faction?
- [Marcy] Wouldn't be the first time.

587
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,084
We've got plenty of cameras
set up outside.

588
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,770
The Director will take 'em out
if they get close.

589
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:27,964
- I can get Philip on some back up if...
- Mac, I got it covered.

590
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:30,675
Hell, I'll bring in air assets
if I have to.

591
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,594
Well, now you're just showing off.

592
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,280
They're upstairs waiting for you.

593
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,056
Kat's in the room
at the top of the stairs.

594
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:42,811
Hey.

595
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:47,442
I wanted to see you sooner,
but Wakefield insisted on debriefing you.

596
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,279
I've felt like this before, Grant.

597
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,658
- Like what?
- That I've lost something.

598
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,785
Time.

599
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:01,122
I woke up once months ago
feeling this way.

600
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,876
My head was pounding like it is now

601
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,400
and I couldn't remember anything
that happened the day before.

602
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:14,469
Remember the day your SUV was stolen?
You said I had too much to drink.

603
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:18,056
Well, you went at it pretty hard, Kat.
What do you want to me to say?

604
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:22,060
That you drugged me.
To make me forget something.

605
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,665
What are you trying to make me forget?

606
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,400
Jesus, Kat, why would I...?

607
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,026
Shit.

608
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,115
Guess I just have to try again.

609
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,203
- No!
- [indistinct chatter]

610
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,705
[MacLaren] Hey.

611
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,126
- Hi.
- Hi.

612
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,045
They said I could,
I could talk to you now.

613
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,924
It's about time.
I've been asking for you all morning.

614
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,183
I'm sorry.
[stutters] I'm going too fast.

615
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:05,520
No, it's okay. It's me, I'm just...

616
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,356
[sighs]

617
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:11,859
Come here.

618
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,335
Kat...

619
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,505
everything is gonna be like it was before.

620
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,798
I promise you.

621
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,311
[Carly] I'm so sorry.

622
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:50,482
Let me see. Does it hurt?

623
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,859
This? Nah, you should see the other guy.

624
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,026
What other guy?

625
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,755
I have no idea,
I'm just assuming there was one.

626
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,280
Hey! Let's get out of here.

627
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:59,484
[stammers] I'm craving sesame chicken
for some reason.

628
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,951
Okay, we can't just pretend
like this didn't happen.

629
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,079
You deal with this sort of thing
every day.

630
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,455
What's a minor kidnapping?

631
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,207
There's nothing minor about this.

632
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,958
I was on the other end of the phone

633
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,021
while you were giving CPR to somebody
after some explosion, for God's sakes!

634
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:14,047
I refuse to make this
a bigger deal than it is.

635
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,964
Okay, David.

636
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,800
You were held by a mass serial killer

637
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,052
who thought time travelers
were out to get him.

638
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,097
I know. Isn't that the stupidest thing
you've ever heard?

639
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
[chuckles] Uh-huh.

640
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,437
[horse whinnying]

641
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,568
Go.

642
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,173
One of our assault teams was forced
to move early on a Serbian cell.

643
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,637
They were about to lose containment.

644
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,032
Casualties?

645
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,703
All five members of the Traveler team
confirmed dead.

646
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,164
Sir. You can't go ahead with this.

647
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,376
You have about 90 seconds
to change my mind.

648
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,216
[car engine starts]

649
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:07,183
- [tires screech]
- [Carly] Shit.

650
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,355
Tell Wakefield and get a weapon.

651
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,237
Mac, Wakefield's team
just bugged out of here

652
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,698
and there are soldiers taking up
positions all around us.

653
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:28,329
I know you need me
and I'll be there for you.

654
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,124
God damn you.

655
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,006
- I'll say it again,
- We've got company.

656
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,383
I'm Senior Special Agent Wakefield

657
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,636
and I need armed air assets
to these coordinates now.

658
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,888
They're not faction.

659
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,699
- I've got 20 armed men out there.
- No, you don't.

660
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:47,883
Most of 'em are already gone.

661
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,267
Then they're on to us.

662
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,026
- Here.
- [cocks gun]

663
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,283
[Carly] Mac, we are outmanned and
out-gunned! Get your ass out here!

664
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,952
Kat, I'm sorry. I gotta go back outside.

665
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,163
- Wait... What?
- I'll be right back.

666
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,168
Okay, I need you to stay here
and stay away from the window.

667
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,003
The window? Okay, get behind me.

668
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,506
How do we know...

669
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,847
The last time the Director spoke to me,
it was not through an AI in Teslia's lab.

670
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:29,766
You received a messenger.

671
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,476
[Yates] But it wasn't a child.

672
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,605
I was just told my mother
was essentially brain dead,

673
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,148
but it was gonna take time.

674
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,401
I wanted to be with her.

675
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,904
Last night, she spoke to me.

676
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,449
Listen to me carefully...

677
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:54,123
Tell him the bargain he made
that autumn morning

678
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:59,712
was not with his God, but with me.

679
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,888
[heart monitor beeping]

680
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,639
Mom.

681
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,272
Those were her exact words.

682
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,899
She died in that moment.

683
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,443
It's not something
I'm ever likely to forget.

684
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,034
Sir?

685
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,788
[whispers] This is the day.

686
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,756
- Get down.
- [MacLaren] How many?

687
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,717
More than we can fight.
Where's Wakefield?

688
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,820
He's inside trying to get Traveler backup.

689
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,905
Maybe we should go back inside the house,
where there's cover...

690
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,369
We're not getting into a fire fight.

691
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:52,724
It won't be up to us.

692
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,327
The Director hasn't waived Protocol 3.

693
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,518
Fuck that.

694
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,156
They're on our six, too.

695
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,162
Sir, we're waiting on your order.

696
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,265
Sir.

697
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,399
Sir?

698
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,112
All units stand down.
Operation's canceled.

699
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,864
No go. I repeat, no go.

700
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,076
All units stand down and pull back
by order of Director Stevenson.

701
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,703
[indistinct chattering]

702
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:07,507
They're leaving.

703
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,341
What?

704
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,553
She's right.

705
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,775
Everybody out of here! Move!

706
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:30,654
Okay, lady.

707
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,241
Come on. You're free to go.

708
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:34,908
Go where?

709
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,369
I could care less.

710
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,954
[engine starts]

711
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,878
[tires screeching]

712
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,468
Are you fucking kidding me?

713
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,776
[sighs]

714
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,039
That autumn morning,
I was also in a hospital room.

715
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,835
My daughter Claire
was dying from a rare form of cancer.

716
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,630
There was very little time left.

717
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,384
She spoke to you.

718
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,851
I will save her life,

719
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,663
but there will come a day of reckoning.

720
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,110
[Stevenson] <i>I never told a soul.</i>

721
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,863
She began to improve the next morning.

722
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,365
I thought it was a miracle.

723
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:02,788
Daddy!

724
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:14,675
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

725
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,011
The Director cured her.

726
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,099
I've read reports
of their advanced technology.

727
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:25,436
Keeps me awake at night.

728
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,775
I wonder what made them stand down.

729
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,694
I have to believe the Director
had something to do with...

730
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:36,405
So... what's going on?

731
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:39,117
David, I told you to stay in the room.

732
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,453
Yeah, but then we didn't.

733
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:47,333
A jumpy junior agent got over-excited.
Honestly, it was nothing.

734
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:51,295
Why don't I believe you?

735
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,676
You made the right decision, sir.

736
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,804
We'll see.

737
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:03,266
So...

738
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,435
What do we do now?
