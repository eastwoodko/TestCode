00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,558
- [laughter]
- You're having fun with this one?

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,809
Okay.

4
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:24,233
And then he... he very quickly realizes
that the cup is nowhere near big enough,

5
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,109
but he can't stop at this point.

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,070
And so there he is, he's stuck in traffic,

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,615
- and he's peeing into a coffee cup.
- [laughter]

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:36,411
- And the level is slowly rising.
- [laughter continues]

[theme music playing]

16
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:57,826
Thanks.

17
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,165
- Shit's gotten pretty crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,919
Always figured Omega was the one protocol
we'd never have to worry about.

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,174
When you consider the amount
of potential revisions

20
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,967
and possible outcomes,

21
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,137
the Director's probably abandoned
millions of timelines.

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,260
Good chance there's a version of us
in most of them.

23
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,727
- Yeah, but I live in this one, so...
- Yeah.

24
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,354
Yeah.

25
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,565
[dishes clink]

26
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,651
What's that thing stuck to your head?

27
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,527
Brain implant.

28
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,948
- For?
- Temporal aphasia. Early onset.

29
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,241
Cool.

30
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,164
We'll file the missing person's report
in 24 hours.

31
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,833
It will have been given by 3569
after she's gone home.

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,652
He didn't come home from work.
That's all she needs to know.

33
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,219
- We'll take care of the rest.
- I'll tell her.

34
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,437
They'll blame us, you know that.

35
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,899
I'm surprised Yates hasn't called already.

36
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,026
I should probably go into the office.

37
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,488
- Can you tell her it was Faction?
- I did.

38
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,242
But after this,
they're never gonna trust a word we say.

39
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,078
Yeah. After this,
I'm not sure I blame them.

40
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,972
[Trevor] Yeah, I still get locked in
once in a while.

41
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,542
The device is just a temporary solution.
There's no cure even in the future.

42
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,253
Switch hosts enough times,
it becomes inevitable.

43
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,548
- So you've switched hosts that many times?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,467
I was an early test subject
for consciousness transfer.

45
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,304
So, you're like really old, then.

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,682
Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty fucking old.

47
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,859
I'm not even sure
what I'm supposed to do now.

48
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,771
What do you mean?

49
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,899
I'm a cop? That's it?

50
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,527
It was fine as Protocol 5,
but I'm a doctor.

51
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,155
- We still have a mission.
- Do we?

52
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,366
Maybe the Director
abandoned this timeline,

53
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,826
but that doesn't mean we have to.

54
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,495
We can't just go around making up
our own missions.

55
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,580
Why not?

56
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,374
Because it would make us no different
than the Faction.

57
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,420
Then we still have a mission to complete.
Find 001.

58
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,840
And how are we supposed to do that?
He could've jumped into anyone by now.

59
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,718
- Without the Director's help...
- I don't know. I just...

60
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,637
We... We have to try.

61
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,558
I'm gonna take off now.

62
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,810
You're bleeding.

63
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,690
- Mm, shit.
- Here.

64
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,651
- I can bandage you up.
- No, no, no.

65
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,070
- Y-You don't gotta.
- Just come here.

66
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,238
Come here.

67
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,502
[exhales]

68
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,631
What?

69
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,304
I'm just so sorry, that's all.

70
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,266
Can I ask you something?

71
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,937
Whatever. Sure.

72
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,233
The future hasn't gotten any better,
has it?

73
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:21,238
- Protocol 2, Marcy.
- Protocol Omega, Jeff.

74
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,532
Truth?

75
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,787
Nothing the Director's done
has made one bit of difference.

76
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,057
But I still think that we can change that.

77
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,874
[exhales]

78
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:40,298
Hey, how about if I finish up? Yeah?

79
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,801
Okay.

80
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,852
- Where you headed?
- Home.

81
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,273
- I'll give you a lift.
- No. You're just gonna wanna talk.

82
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,985
- It's good to talk.
- I already know what you're gonna say

83
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,948
because I've been trained
to say the same thing.

84
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,907
And you'll feel better because we're told
that it helps people, but it doesn't.

85
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,284
- Marcy.
- David...

86
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,994
[exhales]

87
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,999
David was the kind of man
who made humanity worth saving. He...

88
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,960
He literally represented that.

89
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,424
And he's a better human being
than every fucking person in this room.

90
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,095
[sniffs] And the Director did nothing
to save him.

91
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,889
So I'm done.

92
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,436
[door opens, closes]

93
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,733
You want me to go after her,
make sure she gets home okay?

94
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,237
No. Let her go.

95
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,410
Agent MacLaren.

96
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,163
Officer Conniker.

97
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,333
- Thank you for the rescue.
- You stay in touch.

98
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,127
I will.

99
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,924
[door opens]

100
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,886
[people chattering]

101
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,847
Sir...

102
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,535
I have reason to believe
that yesterday's attacks

103
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,186
were not caused by the Travelers.

104
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,664
Well, then I have reason to believe
you're one of them.

105
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,857
There is a resistance group
called the Faction.

106
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,776
Oh, I know all about the Faction,
believe me.

107
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,653
That is their political distinction.

108
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,464
It doesn't change the fact
that the uranium used

109
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,031
in every single one of those nukes

110
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,034
had just been traced back
to the exact same mine in this country.

111
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,371
I was there with Agent MacLaren
and his team

112
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,997
when he disarmed the fourth device.

113
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,917
Okay, so we're supposed to convince
the Russians and the Chinese

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,586
that although every one of the nukes
that went off yesterday

115
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,879
has been traced back to us,

116
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,216
the one that was successfully disarmed
just happened to be on U.S. soil?

117
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,894
'Cause the good Travelers saved us
from the bad Travelers, is that it?

118
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,721
Does that sound like
a compelling argument?

119
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,099
No.

120
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,622
Every one of the groups we're monitoring
keeps saying the same thing.

121
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,022
"Protocol Omega." What is it?

122
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,111
- I'll ask MacLaren.
- Find another way. I don't trust them.

123
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:07,988
Get it right, please.

124
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,448
Right now, we're one nervous general away
from nuclear war.

125
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,060
Do you ever think about
what you would've done

126
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,461
if you hadn't volunteered
for the Traveler program?

127
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,341
No. Never saw myself doing anything else.

128
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,718
[chuckles] Yeah, me, too.

129
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,931
But I'm not sure
I'd make the same decision,

130
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,016
knowing what I know.

131
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,977
- There was another option?
- Yeah. Life.

132
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,149
Life not solely devoted
to training and combat.

133
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,485
Life without Protocol 4.

134
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,281
Stuck in domes,
heated by a failing reactor,

135
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,324
on a diet of yeast and recycled water?

136
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,077
We were barely clinging to life, Carly,
not living it.

137
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,164
Yeah, well, tell that
to my mother and sisters.

138
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,876
They still found a way to laugh every day,

139
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:08,048
fall in love, make families.

140
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,178
Hey, at least you still got your wife
to go home to.

141
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,672
Traveler team report
to the following coordinates immediately:

142
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,823
47.2531 degrees north,
122.4523 degrees west.

143
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,162
What the hell was that?

144
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,247
One way to find out.

145
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,832
- You can't be serious.
- Why not?

146
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,269
You know for a fact that that message
wasn't from the Director.

147
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,979
It's obviously a trap
set up by the Faction.

148
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,922
And if the Faction is working with 001?

149
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,799
Then we're the next ones
behind a brick wall.

150
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,175
We'll take precautions.

151
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,806
Carly, what the hell else
are we supposed to do?

152
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,638
Literally anything else.

153
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,099
We can do whatever we want.

154
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,685
I can't order you to go with me,
but I'm going.

- Trevor, are you there?

157
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,484
I could use your help.

Where's Marcy?

She left a while ago.
It's just you and me.

166
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,631
So, Marcy went home?

167

[Marcy] Okay, just...

00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,212
Go into the living room.

[man] Agent MacLaren.
I'm pleased you were able to make it.

195
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,398
[MacLaren] Okay.

196
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:30,244
Do the names "Vincent Ingram"
or "Katrina Perrow" mean anything to you?

197
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,624
Just wanna have a conversation.

198
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,292
Oh, you better start talking

199
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,504
'cause you've got about ten seconds
before I order your head blown off.

200
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,715
- I wanna cut a deal.
- Eight seconds.

201
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,302
I will turn myself in to the Director
and face the consequences

202
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,972
if you will fill me in on the details
of Protocol Omega.

203
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,600
Fill you in?

204
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,189
It was not a protocol
in the time I was sent back.

205
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,774
[Trevor] Really?

206
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,766
That's what you're going with?

207
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,698
Yates, is this you?

208
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,210
- How did you know?
- [MacLaren] Seriously?

209
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,755
Why didn't you just give him an eye patch
and a cat to stroke?

210
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,815
I need you to come talk to my superiors.

211
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,052
They're my superiors, too.
Why not just text me?

212
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,973
Because they don't trust you.
Three nuclear devices just went off.

213
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,476
And you watched us disarm the fourth.
How could you possibly...?

214
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,479
You know what? Fine. Let's go.

215
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,608
- All of them. Including the sniper.
- Uh, no.

216
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,320
Carly, you and Trevor head back in my car.
This won't take long.

217
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,737
[Carly] Copy that.

218
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,577
Happy to go with, boss.

219
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,038
This is my Protocol 5, remember?

220
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,083
Okay, fine.

221
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,801
- Who did you get to play the messenger?
- [sigh] Johanson's kid.

222
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,636
Wants to be an actress.

223
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,346
[MacLaren] She's good.

- Oh! Shit.
- Oh.

00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,326
Ah.

230
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,221
Now you can't expect beginner's luck
to last.

231
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,245
- Gin.
- I didn't...

232
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,143
- [snaps fingers]
- That's your shirt.

233
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,567
- Ah, well, rules are rules. All right.
- That's your shirt.

234
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,878
- [Marcy whistles]
- Oh, man.

235
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,713
- [chuckles]
- Whoo.

236
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,632
- [Marcy] Aw. [chuckles]
- [David] Right?

237
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,452
- All right, one more round and then...
- Okay. Keep going.

238
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,485
- [gasps]
- [both laughing]

239
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,156
Philip.

240
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,661
Hey, Philip. Hey.

241
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:18,787
[whispers] Hey.

242
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,924
You saw something
in the bathroom, didn't you?

243
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,968
I would never do that.
You know that, right?

244
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,346
I don't really.

245
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,951
I know you don't wanna rely on the drugs,
but if those pills are helping,

246
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,435
- you need to keep taking them.
- I can't. I threw them away.

247
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,856
- [sighs]
- And only an archivist can give me more.

248
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,113
Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.

249
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,491
Hey, please...
please take care of yourself.

250
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:58,952
Yeah.

251
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,923
David was a really good guy.

Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

[elevator dings]

263
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,139
[MacLaren] Renovations?

264
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,642
- Everything needs to be hard-wired.
- Because?

265
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,977
We've built our version
of what you call an S.T.A.,

266
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,313
Space Time Attenuation field generator.

267
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,191
I'm told it'll make it impossible
for the Director to see us.

268
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,944
It's under guard on the floor below

269
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,630
if you're thinking of looking
for the off switch.

270
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,614
That precaution really wasn't necessary.

271
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,539
Director Stevenson,
it's an honor to meet you.

272
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,203
Turn off your comm device.

273
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,371
My comm?

274
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,375
Okay.

275
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,961
- It's off.
- Good.

276
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,843
- [feedback ringing]
- Jesus! Okay, okay, okay.

277
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,302
- [comm beeps]
- It's off.

278
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,639
Give me one reason
I shouldn't round up every one of you.

279
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:29,103
The nuclear devices were built
by the Faction. They're still out there.

280
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,897
Protocol Omega, what does it mean?

281
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,526
It means the Director will no longer be
intervening in this timeline.

282
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,404
- What does that mean?
- No more messengers, no more missions.

283
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,383
Those who are part of the Traveler program
are free to live out their days,

284
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,492
such as they are, as they see fit.

285
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,221
- Why would the Director do that?
- It's impossible to say for sure.

286
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,455
Venture a guess.

287
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,290
It could mean that we've succeeded

288
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,001
and we're now on the optimal path
to a better future.

289
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,563
It could also mean there's no possible way
of saving the future

290
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,755
no matter what you do.

291
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,215
That's true.

292
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,979
Why should we believe a word
you're saying?

293
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,996
[MacLaren] That's your call, sir.

294
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,306
But I'm willing to help in any way I can

295
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,768
and I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

296
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,320
[knocking on door]

297
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,544
Jeff.

298
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,340
Hey, just wanna check in on you,

299
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,883
see how's it going.

300
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,969
I brought you something.

301
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,183
It's water flavoring made of leaves.
You just add boiling water.

302
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,102
Yeah, yeah, I know what tea is. [chuckles]

303
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,991
I've developed
quite a taste for it myself.

304
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,313
Hmm.

305
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,736
Uh, do you wanna come in
and have a cup with me?

306
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,863
If... If that would be cool.

307
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,027
- [stammers] But I don't wanna...
- Come on. Come in.

308
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,251
Take a seat.

309
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,432
Looks like you've been doing
some cleaning.

310
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,589
Yeah, just trying to keep busy.

311
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,677
I'll be okay.
I just need some time, you know?

312
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,596
Time, yes.

313
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,308
Don't we all?

314
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,690
I know what you've been through, Marcy.

315
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:40,859
You do?

316
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,446
Well, not everything.

317
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,200
I can't imagine
what it must have been like for you,

318
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,079
to go through your reset,
to lose all those memories.

319
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,249
[sighs]

320
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,378
The Director took my wife from me, too.

321
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,340
You mean your... your wife in the future.

322
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:05,884
Death by messenger.

323
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,344
Just like David.

324
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,685
Precious life,
snuffed out right before my eyes.

325
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,316
But we have no right to complain.

326
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,152
We forfeited that right

327
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:29,033
when we made the decision to put our fate
in the hands of a machine.

328
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,163
Um, I'm sorry you went through all that.

329
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,917
Is another reset possible, I wonder?

330
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,507
Is Ellis's backdoor code to the Director

331
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,260
still buried in there somewhere?

332
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:51,555
I don't think so.

333
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,515
Oh, I think so.

334
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,517
I really do.

335
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:07,488
Anyway, it's... it's just good to see you
whole again, Marcy.

336
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,158
- [kettle whistling]
- I should get that.

337
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,950
Let me help you.

338
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,751
- [grunts]
- [screams]

339
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,338
Guys!

340
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,049
<i>001 went into Jeff!</i>

341
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,012
<i>He's after Ellis's backdoor code.
He thinks... He thinks it's in my head.</i>

342
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,638
Guys, I need your help!

343
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,556
[Marcy grunting]

344
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,267
[Marcy groans]

345
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,605
Marcy?

346
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,732
<i>Mac, Trevor? Can anyone here me?</i>

347
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,236
Sorry, I must've got locked in for a sec.

348
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,698
I didn't catch it all,
but Marcy's in trouble.

349
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,948
Meet me at her place.

350
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:53,408
[Marcy groans]

351
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,037
Ah!

352
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:06,630
[groaning]

353
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:09,341

[groans]

356
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,536
- [feedback ringing]
- Ugh. Mac, I have 001.

357
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,497
The gun isn't loaded, Marcy.

358
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,001
[trigger clicking]

359
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,337
I could never risk
what's in that pretty little head.

360
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,214
- Ugh. [panting]
- [door slams]

361
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,509
Take her.

362
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,270
[people chattering]

363
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,903
- [siren wails]
- [horns honking]

364
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,304
It's the end of the world, brother.
We're all gonna die now.

365
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:03,539
Before I agree to let you do anything,
I wanna know about the future.

366
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,911
[MacLaren] I can only tell you
about the time I left.

367
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,293
It's changed because you changed history.

368
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,129
Not necessarily for the better.

369
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,776
From what little I've heard,
even after all we've done,

370
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,010
humanity is still on the brink
of extinction.

371
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,388
A more recent Traveler
might be able to tell you more.

372
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,725
Just tell me the history you remember.
What went wrong?

373
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,564
The decline took years,
but this decade was the turning point.

374
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,944
Once climate change became unstoppable,
it led to mass migration,

375
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,364
severe overpopulation
in urban centers, famine.

376
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,284
Ancient diseases became unlocked
as polar ice melted,

377
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:44,037
which exposed humanity to viruses
for which we had no immunity.

378
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:49,001
That led to mass death,
collapse of governments, resources,

379
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,086
war over what was left.

380
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,548
Eventually, nuclear winter.

381
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,053
How the hell
were you supposed to stop all that?

382
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,596
Our primary mission

383
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,141
was to prevent a massive asteroid strike
in the Atlantic.

384
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,224
[Stevenson] Helios.

385
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,732
When an x-ray laser's fired toward
a previously undiscovered asteroid

386
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,859
from within the continental United States,

387
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,611
now that tends not to go unnoticed.

388
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,239
We should prove our good intentions.
Helios killed millions.

389
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,950
The Grand Plan
was supposed to erase all that.

390
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,703
- [Stevenson] Why didn't it work?
- I honestly can't answer that.

391
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,622
Only that the Director kept trying.

392
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,873
Till today.

393
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,423
Agent MacLaren, today, this country's
been accused by my counterparts

394
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,717
in Russia, China, even by our allies,

395
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,386
of detonating nuclear devices
on their soil.

396
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,347
I told you that was the Faction.

397
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,759
- They don't know that.
- Well, then let me tell them.

398
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,518
Let me tell them everything.
We can still fix this.

399
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,607
I can reach out.
We'll need to arrange translators.

400
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,651
That won't be necessary.

401
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:57,778
[door opens]

402
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,409
[comm beeps]

403
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,120
Carly, I'm at the apartment.

404
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,831
[Carly]<i> I'm still a few minutes out.
Is she there?</i>

405
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,001
No. And the place is trashed.

406
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,420
[Carly]<i> Oh, God. Marcy, can you hear me?</i>

407
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,630
Say that again.

408
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,842
[Carly]<i> Come in, Marcy. Marcy, you there?</i>

409
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
[Trevor] Ah, shit.

410
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,060
I found her comm. It's been cut out.

411
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,852
[Carly]<i> He's taken her.</i>

412
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,316
You said you didn't catch it all.
What did you hear her say?

413
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,944
[Carly]<i> Something about
Ellis's backdoor code.</i>

414
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,316
What good is the code
without access to the Director?

415
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,659
Boss, we got a problem.

416
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,246
Philip, Mac's turned off his comm.

417
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,247
[comm beeps]

418
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,330
Okay, I'm close to his house.
I'll try to find him.

419
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,746
Carly, meet me out front.
I know where they're going.

420
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,464
- [grunts]
- [Grace] Marcy, I'm sorry. [sobs]

421
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,010
I thought the Director would stop them.
They drugged me.

422
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,971
Grace, what did you tell them? [panting]

423
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Boss, are you here?

424
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,142
[MacLaren] Oh, okay.

425
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,937
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh.

426
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,108
That's good, huh?

427
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,788
[Kathryn moans]

428
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,380
Uh, I'm... I'm gonna...

429
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,884
I'm just gonna... gonna go.

00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,307
[birds chirping]

431
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,978
[in Chinese]<i> What is the number
of Travelers in my country?</i>

432
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:59,941
[in Chinese] Each Traveler team
is forbidden by our protocols

433
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,865
to communicate with each other
unless directed.

434
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,655
[in Russian]<i> We have captured
several Traveler cells in Russia.</i>

435
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,867
<i>They told us this Faction originated
in the United States.</i>

436
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,997
[in Russian] They first came en masse
from the future to the U.S., yes,

437
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:18,377
but they have since spread out
to many countries.

438
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,860
[in English]<i> Having consolidated
their power in your country.</i>

439
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,133
- My team is on their way.
- Protocol Omega.

440
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,303
[panting] Why do you think
that this code is still in my head?

441
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,099
Actually, Grace told me.

442
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,702
Even told me how to use it
to hack the Director.

443
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,105
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- What if she's wrong?

444
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,291
[Jeff] Then nothing happens,
and I'm disappointed.

445
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,068
But if she's right,
the Director becomes permanently disabled

446
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,404
and the future belongs to humanity.

447
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,614
- Oh, you mean the Faction?
- Yes.

448
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,784
- Led by you?
- So I'm told.

449
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:56,206
This reset will take away
all those painful memories, Marcy.

450
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,835
[panting]
Memories of who I am now.

451
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,296
[Jeff] The Director allowed the man
that you love to die horribly

452
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,965
when it could have saved him.

453
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,925
How can you forgive that?

454
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,482
By doing this,
we'll both get what we want.

455
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,898
All right, let's get this over with.

456

00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,703
You can't have it.

460
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,706
- No!

[Grace sobbing]

463

The other way
is gonna take so much longer.

464
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,578
Travelers will cooperate, I promise you.

465
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,514
We can even help find members
of the Faction

466
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,998
responsible for the nuclear devices.

467

<i>Then will you share
your advanced technologies?</i>

468
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,922
Our engineers have been creating materials
and... and building devices for a decade.

469
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,633
I think if our technology
is shared equitably, we...

- [keyboard clacking]
- Sir, we're making progress.

471
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,613
This isn't the time
to be negotiating access

472
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,317
to future technologies
with foreign powers.

473
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,641
If we're to trust each other, we...

474
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,937
- What is happening?
- They're being overwritten.

475
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,397
- The Director's not doing this...
- Then who is?

476
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,250
- I don't know. But it's impossible...
- [phone ringing]

477
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,151
...for the Director to take life
in that way.

478
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,235
Stevenson.

479
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,780
When did this happen?

480
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:57,202
- All right, keep me up to date.
- [phone thudding]

481
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,330
The president and most of his cabinet
just screamed in pain and collapsed.

482
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,705
Oh, my God.

483
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,543
They all claim to be fine now.
This happened to the Speaker as well.

484
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,418
This is a coup.

485
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,798
I need to get back to Washington.
Arrest this son of a bitch.

486
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,424
Put your hands on your head.

487
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,968
- Jo, you gotta believe me.
- Now!

488
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:15,845
[elevator dings]

489
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:29,359
[feedback ringing]

490
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,575
- Listen to me.
- Shut the fuck up.

491
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,418
The same thing
that happened to the president

492
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,121
is probably happening
to other world leaders right now.

493
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,204
Let me help you.

494
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,548
[inhales]

495
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,302
I need to talk to my team.

496
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,907
[MacLaren]<i> Guys, it's me,
what's happening?</i>

497
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,476
[sighs] Where the fuck have you been?
001's taken Jeff as a host.

498
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:04,977
No.

499
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,420
[Trevor]<i> The rescue was just a set up
to get access to Marcy.</i>

500
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,481
Why Marcy?

501
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,318
[Trevor]<i> So he could use Ellis's
backdoor code against the Director.</i>

502
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,905
- Through Ilsa. He's taken her to Filmore.
- Yeah, that's our guess, too.

503
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,342
- We're almost there.
- [Philip]<i> Boss, I could use a pick up.</i>

504
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,327
- Okay, I'll get you on the way.
- [comm beeps]

505
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,620
You're not going anywhere.

506
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:25,665
[phone ringing, buzzing]

507
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:27,584
[phone chimes]

508
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,253
[phone beeps]

509
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,466
[phones beeping]

510
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,553
[indistinct chatter]

511
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,597
[woman screaming]

512
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,891
Guys, am I the only one seeing this?

513
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,853
[Carly] No. We see it, too.

514
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,274
You need to get out.

515
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,063
I have to go see my son.
Filmore's not far from here.

516
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,779
Carly, there isn't much time.

517
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,156
I know. Go.

518
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,458
- [comm beeps]
- Boss, Carly's out.

519
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,418
Protocol Omega. I'll meet you at Filmore.

520
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,096
Yes, ma'am.

521
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,267
I'll try and get the Director
to safety. [exhales]

522
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,061
[phone beeps]

523
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,355
NORAD's detected a massive missile strike

524
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,692
from both Russia and China.

525
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,267
Tell me why this is happening.

526
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,488
The first ever Traveler 001
has taken over in the future.

527
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,656
Don't ask me how.

528
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,116
- He launched the missiles?
- No.

529
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,119
That would likely be the generals
following standing orders to launch

530
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,971
in the event their leadership
was overwritten.

531
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,539
But he is still the cause.

532
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,124
NORAD said we were targeted.

533
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,542
Jo,

534
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:56,172
you can either come with me
or you can shoot me in the back.

535
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,633
Bye, Marce.

536
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,636
I'm sorry.

537
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,139
[MacLaren] Trevor! What are you doing?

538
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,918
001 must have uploaded
his consciousness into Ilsa.

539
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,669
[Grace] No, he's not in there.

540
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,546
[metal clinks]

541
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,756
[Trevor] Grace.

542
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,340
Grace, hey.

543
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,888
[Grace] He wasn't able to use
the backdoor code either.

544
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:31,351
Marcy... took that from him.

545
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:45,948
Then where is he?

546
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,118
[Grace] Ugh. He's everywhere. [groans]

547
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,202
I don't understand.

548
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,333
001 transferred his consciousness
first into Ilsa,

549
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,668
and then out to the Internet.

550
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,129
By now, he's parsed himself into computers
and servers all over the world,

551
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,173
just waiting for the future to arrive,

552
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,842
and then he can take over.

553
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,346
I didn't think it would matter
if I said anything.

554
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,391
I just thought the Director
would stop him.

555
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,727
I just was waiting. [exhales]

556
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,187
He won.

557
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,816
[Jo] What?

558
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,694
Then why did we come here?

559
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,862
I'm sorry, Jo.

560
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,155
It's over.

561
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:34,998
[Philip] Maybe not.

562
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,849
Maybe everything we need to fix this
is right here in front of us.

563
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,005
Maybe the Director
is just expecting us to see it.

564
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,066
How many timelines
are you seeing right now?

565
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,175
Just one. The only one left.

566
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:50,471
And it's gonna end
unless one of us goes back.

567
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,598
Back in time?

568
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,895
Whoa. Guys, even if one of us was able
to upload their consciousness into Ilsa,

569
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,998
and even if Ilsa had the electrical
and processing power...

570
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,148
Which it does.

571
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,524
The Director's made sure of that

572
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,235
by downloading the program into Ilsa
in the middle of the night.

573
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,322
Even then, we could only send someone
to a point in time

574
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,645
after the most recent Traveler.

575
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:12,160
No, from 431 years in the future,
that's true, absolutely,

576
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,370
but not from now.

577
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:20,877
The amplitude of space-time distortion
is directly proportional to distance.

578
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,589
How far back could one safely go
from this point in time?

579
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,672
Twenty years, easy.

580
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,217
All we need to do
is go back before 001 arrived.

581
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,018
[Grace] That's why the Director's
been silent.

582
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,614
Because it knew we would think of this,

583
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,557
and it sent us what we would need
to do it.

584
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:40,146
I'm sorry, I do love this idea,
but we'd still need a TELL.

585
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,358
It's a time, elevation, latitude
and longitude

586
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,568
to send a consciousness
into a specific host.

587
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,112
You can't just guess. It has to be exact.

588
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:53,242
August 18th, 2001, Whytecliff Park,
exactly 3:00 p.m.

589
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,664
When and where my host met Kat.

590
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,540
Okay.

591
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,211
And I have one last objection,
but it's a big one.

592
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:07,674
If this works,
I'll be ending Grant MacLaren's life

593
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,926
17 years before his historical death,
I know.

594
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,550
But maybe I can give those years
back to someone else.

595
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,648
So...

596
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,652
until we meet again.

597
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,780
That's a very interesting possibility.

598
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,410
[Jo] Well...

599
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,997
if we're gonna do this,

600
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,834
hurry the fuck up.

601
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,415
I'll find the coordinates to Whytecliff
and the IMEI of MacLaren's cell phone.

602
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,508
- [Grace] Trevor, help me load the program.
- [MacLaren exhales]

603
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,804
- See, Jo? There's still hope.
- Hope?

604
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,848
Mac,

605
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,018
you did this.

606
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,189
You people didn't stop
the collapse of civilization.

607
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,941
If anything, you sped it up.

608
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,406
Where are you going?

609
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,703
To look at the sky.

610
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,495
[birds chirping]

611
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,039
[seagulls calling]

612
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,799
Beautiful view, isn't it?

613
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,092
- Oh, God.
- Sorry. Ha-ha.

614
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,551
Didn't mean to sneak up on you.

615
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:19,555
No, it's all right.
I was just expecting someone. He's late.

616
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,974
Some people are late people.

617
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,227
- Almost an hour?
- That's pretty late.

618
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,812
Hmm. On my birthday?

619
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,357
- Oh, he's in the doghouse.
- Yes, he is.

620
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,486
John's an artist.
He gets caught up in his work.

621
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,862
Is he any good?

622
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,368
He's brilliant, actually.

623
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,829
Maybe he's painting a portrait of you
for your birthday.

624
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,748
There are enough of those portraits
around the house, believe me.

625
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,375
- [chuckles]
- Ah. Wow.

626
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,337
As intriguing as that is, we just met,
I should probably leave it alone.

627
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,300
- I love him, he just does this too often.
- So set him straight.

628
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,304
Tell him if he respects you,
he won't keep you waiting,

629
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,699
and that he's goddamn lucky

630
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,560
to have a woman as beautiful
and charming as you in his life.

631
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,436
- [chuckles]
- What?

632
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,482
I'm can't tell if you're flirting with me
or telling me to give him another chance.

633
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:17,113
Well, if I was him,
I know I'd want another chance.

634
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,327
But I'm not him.

635
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,957
Happy birthday.

636
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,063
[no audible dialogue]

637
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,451
[people chattering]

638
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,169
[indistinct chattering]

639
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:23,406
[siren wailing]

640
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,784
Hey!

641
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,330
Who the fuck is this guy?

642
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,209
Sorry, I just wanna make sure
you're on the right bus.

643
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,212
This one's headed
to kind of a rough part of town.

644
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,922
I know.

645
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,529
I didn't like the way my patients
were being treated

646
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,015
at the old hospital I worked at,
so, I'm starting at a new one on Main.

647
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,518
Oh. I take some of my clients there.
I'm a social worker.

648
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:35,644
- Oh. [giggles]
- Yeah.

649
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,271
- Are you doctor or a...?
- Uh, nurse.

650
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,397
- Nurse?
- Nurse, yeah.

651
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,856
Right.

652
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,195
Oh, it's a... it's a pretty busy hospital.

653
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,573
Just to warn you. A lot of tough cases.

654
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:52,620
- Well, I'm pretty tough. [giggles]
- I bet.

655
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,562
I just wanna help the people
who really need it, you know?

656
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,546
Yeah. Yeah, same.

657
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,512
My name's David.

658
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:17,436
[beeping]

659
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,625
