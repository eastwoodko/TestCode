Everyone, stay calm
and take their green pills.

[woman] Can you pass those pills?

00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,650
Did he just get overwritten?

00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,078
[Philip] You've never seen
an arrival before?

8
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:53,946
No.

9
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,910
I guess the update
would've killed him, so...

10
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,124
Welcome to the 21st. I'm Archivist 18.

11
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,917
Traveler 5782.

12
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,397
[Archivist 18] Your team's waiting
for you at these coordinates.

13
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,514
[Dawn] Historians, we are Faction.

14
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:22,267
Now that you have a better understanding
of the future,

15
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:24,711
we're gonna go somewhere in private
and have a conversation.

Hello?

Hello!

20
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,651
MacLaren?

21
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,528
Yes.

22
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,031
- And no.
- [Hall] Uh-huh.

23
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,535
Okay. Yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense.

24
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,372
- How 'bout we just get outta here, huh?
- There is no here.

25
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,542
Only now.

26
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,868
What the fuck does that mean?
'Cause you're killing me.

27
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,841
This place and my presence
are creations of your own mind.

28
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,758
Really?

29
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:40,595
I brought Special Agent Boy Scout?
Why would I do that?

30
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,347
Because you're dying.

What are his chances?

34
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,669
[Marcy] We're just buying time. [sighs]

35
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,533
He's losing too much blood, and we've lost
too many nanites as a result.

36
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,198
The damage to his internal organs
is beyond their capability to repair now.

37
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,869
Sorry, it took a while
to synthesize the neuro-stimulant.

38
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,455
- How's our patient?
- Barely holding on.

39
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,956
Okay. I'll scrub in and join you.

40
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,669
How'd you manage
to build a black box so quickly?

41
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,960
Already had one in the works.

42
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,646
[Boyd] What're you hoping to get?
Who shot him?

43
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,340
That, and if Hall has any idea
where Philip and the other historians are.

44
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,718
Well, there's six reported missing
on the backchannel now.

45
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,928
[Boyd] Seven.
I can't find mine on his comm either.

46
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,473
But it's too much of a coincidence
that Hall gets shot

47
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,934
right when historians go missing.
He's gotta be involved in this.

48
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,518
Yeah, on which side?

49
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,850
Hey, let's just assume
the patient can hear us, okay?

50
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,776
We've had our differences, but I've never
doubted his loyalty to the Director.

51
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,403
My guess, whoever did this,
Hall was onto him.

52
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,031
- Has he given you any useful images?
- Nothing.

53
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,699
The neuro-stimulant should help.

54
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,118
Yeah, it better.
We don't have much to go on.

55
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:48,663
Well, I did manage to pull the GPS history
from Philip's comm.

56
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,183
This was the last place he was at
before he was probably cut out.

I'm not hungry.

- Where's Kyle?
- He's fine.

66

- I know that you see us as the enemy...
- Because you're the enemy.

- But we want the same thing.
- Not even close.

68
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,762
- To save the future of humanity.
- Okay, what about your host?

69
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,740
Was she historically supposed to die?
Or was she just convenient?

70
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,954
Did you know anything about her
before you randomly murdered her

71
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:53,978
and took over her life?

72
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,140
It was for the greater good.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,692
You released a plague that was
supposed to kill over one billion people.

74
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,278
How is that the greater good?

75
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,780
What if that had saved the future?

76
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:08,034
What if one mass culling
right at the turning point

77
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,494
changed everything for the better?

78
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,206
Your way isn't working.

79
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,333
How do you not see that?

80
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,420
- The Director isn't giving up.
- The Director...

81
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,172
who will overwrite you
the moment that you're no longer viable?

82
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,133
Because that's what happened

83
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,093
to that poor soul
at your update this morning.

84
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,823
We wanna take the information
that you just received about the future

85
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,140
and put it to good use.

86
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,226
What is so wrong with that?

87
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,452
Well, I managed to get your charges
dropped on the DUI,

88
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,121
- but you're still on probation.
- When can I get back to work?

89
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:54,622
Well, that's up to you.

90
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,483
Prove you're aware of the problem
and are working to fix it.

91
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,919
Okay. Tell me what to do,
I'll... I'll do it.

92
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,797
AA, therapy, community service.

93
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,027
End of the day, you're gonna have
to get someone from Social Services

94
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,469
to sign off on your rehab.

95
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,012

[chuckles] I'm glad you think so.

97
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,392
Here's a list.

98
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,812
I put a star next to the social workers
I think would be a good fit.

99
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,695
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Sarge.

You do know
if you were an actual FBI agent,

103
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,628
you'd be fired by now.

- Is this for FBI purposes?
- <i>No.</i>

106
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,467
Then no.

107

I'm sorry.

<i>Philip Pearson.
You'll find him in the database as my CI.</i>

- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

115
00:08:18,707 --> 00:08:19,749
What did they say to you?

116
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,930
They want me to tell them
about the update.

117
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,504
Of course they do.
They don't have any historians.

118
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,465
- Did you tell them anything?
- No.

119
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,425
We can't trust them.

120

Kyle...

121
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,393
What did you tell them?

122
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,689
They just said they wanna help.

123
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,941
They said if I gave them a tell,

124
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,152
they would save someone's life
to prove it.

125
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,613
I just figured,
worst case scenario, I help someone.

126
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,825
Best case scenario, the Director sees
a tell was interfered with,

127
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,454
- sends a Traveler team to look into it.
- It's not about saving one person.

128
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,122
What do we have to lose?

129
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,142
The updates eventually kill you,
you saw that happen...

130
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,209
You know what you signed up for.

131
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,003
We took an oath.

[breathes deeply]

133
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,676
Do you regret saving Aleksander Andrieko?

134
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,015
- A lot of people agree with what you did.
- You mean, create a monster?

135
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,479
- I put myself and my team in danger.
- It was the right thing to do.

136
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,106
You know it was.

137
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,239
I'm diverting some of the nanites
to stem the internal blood loss.

138
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,494
If we can't stop him from dying, at least
we can maximize the time he has left.

139
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,496
- Anything on the black box?
- Nothin' yet.

140
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,765
Dying? What does that...
What does that mean?

141
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:51,965
You were shot.

142
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,637
Nanites are attempting
to repair the damage as we speak.

143
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,597
All right. So... so maybe I'll be okay.

144
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,433
But your survival is highly unlikely.

145
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,186
Well, that's just fucking great, MacLaren.

146
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,522
- Who shot me? You?
- No.

147
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,358
Look, are you... you sure about this?
'Cause...

148
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,253
You know, I don't feel a thing.
I feel... I feel great.

149
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,197
Can you remember where you were
when you were shot?

150
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,408
- Concentrate on your last moments.
- My last moments?

151
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,301
You got me hooked up to a fucking
black box? Is that what this is?

152
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,957
We have employed
memory recovery technology, yes.

153
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,584
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
So, I'm already dead?

154
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,730
You just... You just tryin' to figure out
who killed me?

155
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,965
You're being kept alive
as long as possible

156
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,676
in order to retrieve
what might be vital information.

157
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:36,052
So, what do you think?

158
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,447
The Director's just gonna let me die
with all the time I've put in?

159
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,850
I was... I was the Director's top guy.
You know the missions I've put in.

160
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,686
There are lives other than your own
at stake.

161
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,271
Is that right? Who? Who?

162
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,648
If you can remember details
of your last moments...

163
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,068
I just found out you're the last face
I'm gonna see. Give me a minute.

164
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,897
[classical music playing]

165
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,905
So this is what an update looks like.

166
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,033
Wonder why they left the projector.

167
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:47,998
Mac?

168
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,791
Don't look at it.

169
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,003
Mac! Mac!

170
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,464
[music stops]

171
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,091
Are you okay?

172
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,762
[sniffs] I think so.

173
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,931
[breathes heavily]

174
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,727
So, Philip was at an update.

175
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,482
Yeah. That must be why
the historians are missing.

176
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,970
The Faction must wanna use them.

177
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,529
- And one of 'em got followed?
- Or one of them got turned.

178
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,242
[knocking]

179
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,377
Jeff. Hey, come on in.

180
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,128
Thanks for making time.

181
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,385
So...

182
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,308
What's up?

183
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,393
Are you okay?

184
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,980
Me? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

185
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,064
Me? You? Why?

186
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,193
- You seem nervous.
- Oh. [chuckles]

187
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
I am.

188
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,423
Well, don't be. I just need your help.

189
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,198
My help?

190
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,010
That's funny,
'cause the last time I offered help,

191
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:06,911
you explicitly said you didn't need it.

192
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,330
- Sorry about that.
- And then you insinuated again

193
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:12,291
that I was in an unethical relationship
with Marcy.

194
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,294
- I shouldn't have said that.
- She works for the FBI, for God's sakes!

195
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,818
- Her being in the care of the state...
- Davin. David. David!

196
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,261
I need you to think of me as a new man.

197
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,265
New how?

198
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,558
I used to drink.

199
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:30,977
[chuckles]

200
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,188
Yeah, no kidding.
I got your phone messages.

201
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,735
I haven't had a drop in over a week.

202
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:41,862
Oh.

203
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,756
Well, that's good for you.
That's... That's a real accomplishment.

204
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,787
Yeah. Sometimes you gotta make changes,
you know what I'm sayin'?

205
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,290
Yeah, you do. I mean, we all do.

206
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,044
I mean, I've been making changes myself.

207
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,253
Hmm.

208
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,257
Maybe what we went through was...
like a wake-up call.

209
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,259
That's what I said!

210
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,220
[chuckles]

211
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,309
- So how can I help?
- I need a social worker.

212
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,645
[heart monitor beeping]

213
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,729
The shot to his gut tore his liver,
hepatic artery,

214
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,876
- and the gallbladder.
- He can't lose any more blood.

215
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,836
[Boyd] We're gonna have to isolate
his cardiovascular system

216
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,529
to his trunk and brain to keep him
functioning as long as possible

217
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,133
to give him a chance to help us.
I know. I don't like it either.

218
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,057
He'd wanna make it worth something.

219
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,184
So, what are you gonna do?
You're gonna pull the plug

220
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,460
- when you get what you want?
- Lives are at stake, Hall.

221
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,003
Jesus Christ, MacLaren.

222
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,756
If you're not real, how come
you're still such a pain in the ass?

223
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:42,965
Try to concentrate.

224
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,842
All right. I got it. Okay.

225
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,428
[breathes heavily]

226
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,056
All right, last thing I remember was...

227
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,226
I was in a car with Luca.

228
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,573
- [comm beeps]
- Kyle, it's Hall. Where are you?

229
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,550
Maybe he's caught up
in something personal.

230
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,843
- [car door closes]
- Fuck personal.

231
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,120
He's on my team or he's not.
We've got shit to do.

232
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,101
[Luca] All clear.

233
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,649
[sighs]

234
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,760
Got our first image.

235
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,393
- A comm?
- It could be.

236
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,189
Good work, Hall. We're getting it.

237
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,901
Shit.

238
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,922
All right. Remember Protocol Three
is suspended for Faction.

239
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,257
But if we talk to them, we might...

240
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,408
You stop to have a chat,
they'll shoot you in the ass.

241
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:33,909
Or maybe they'll listen.

242
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,121
What? They kidnapped our historian.

243
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,485
You'd do the same in their place.

244
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,985
Are you fucking serious right now?

245
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,843
[stutters] Am I even having
this conversation?

246
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:46,838
Luca, go!

247
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,434
[lock clinks]

248
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,518
How are you two doing?

249
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,367
I could use some of those yellow pills
that we're supposed to take.

250
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,562
I thought you'd never ask.

251
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,897
[Dawn] We're nearing the time of the tell
you provided.

252
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,754
I thought you might wanna see the result.

253
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,039
If the information you gave is correct,
it should be in about 30 seconds.

254
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,558
That truck was supposed to hit him.

255
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,310
But instead, we changed history.

256
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,230
A man would have died...

257
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,858
but instead we saved his life.

258
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,946
We've already erased
the traffic cam footage.

259
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,575
Working with us,
historians don't have to carry the burden.

260
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:58,952
We can act on it.

261
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,164
Until you get caught or overwritten.

262
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,002
You can't outrun the future.

263
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,212
We managed to get you here.

264
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,346
We can force you to tell us what you know.

265
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,724
We just prefer it
to be of your own accord.

266
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,394
- [pounding on door]
- [door opens]

- [door closes]
- [lock clinks]

268
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,195
Wow. That sucks.

269
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,783
Losing your job and your kid
practically at the same time.

270
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,161
It just put me over the top.

271
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,335
Well, you've taken step one, so...

272
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,350
Yeah. That's... That's what I'm thinkin'.

273
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,547
And you do seem a lot less...

274
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:53,507
[growls softly]

275
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,969
[chuckles] David, I'm telling you,
I got this.

276
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,932
I just need you to sign this form
that says as much,

277
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,268
and then we can call it a day.

278
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:05,894
Yeah.

279
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,521
I can't do that.

280
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,944
- I thought you said you wanted to help.
- Which means actually helping.

281
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,405
Well, it would really help me
if you sign this form.

282
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,075
Come on. I work with addicts every day.

283
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,871
- I am not an addict anymore.
- Just stop it. You know better.

284
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,332
I do know better,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

285
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,258
Okay, here's the deal,
if you want my help, I'm happy to.

286
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,931
But if you expect me just to sign
a piece of paper and be done with it...

287
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,473
- Wait. Isn't that what you do?
- No.

288
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,826
No. Not without putting
the actual work in.

289
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,853
Otherwise, I'm just lying,
and I... I suck at lying.

290
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:48,937
So...

291
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:51,732
it's up to you.

292
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,150
[sighs]

293
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,696
I'd like your help.

294
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,825
- Great.
- [claps]

295
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,908
Let's go for a walk.

296
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,829
First, do no harm.

297
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,206
[Boyd] Yeah, well, Protocol One comes
even before that.

298
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,128
- What's the name of your historian?
- Nathan.

299
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,714
He's my last remaining teammate.

300
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,776
So, what happens to me
when I'm the only member of my team left?

301
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,469
- [Marcy] It won't come to that.
- Marcy's right. We'll find them.

302
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,012
Okay, but if we don't...

303
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,849
I mean, what even happens
if you lose your whole team?

304
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,893
Get reassigned?
Protocol Five 'til you die?

305
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,146
I'm sure the Director has a plan.

306
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,481
I just can't imagine
having to continue on alone.

307
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,442
You're not alone.

308
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,944
- [MacLaren]<i> Trevor, Marcy.</i>
- Yeah. We're here.

309
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,194
[Trevor]<i> What's up, boss?</i>

310
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,281
We just arrived where Boyd found Hall.

311
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,225
Anything show up on the black box?

312
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,662
[Trevor]<i> One image so far.
Looks like Hall had a comm in his hand.</i>

313
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,746
How is he?

314
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,915
[breathes deeply] We're taking measures

315
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,293
to keep his brain active
for the next few hours.

316
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,213
[Hall]<i> My arm's going numb.</i>

317
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,007
Go on. What do you remember?

318
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,094
Ah. Just the... They were...
They were shooting at us.

319
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,721
- Who?
- The Faction.

320
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,974
I don't... I can't picture their faces,

321
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,019
but, uh, I managed to kill two
before we left the building.

322
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:11,729
Where did you go?

323
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,023
I don't know. We left a different way
than we came in.

324
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,276
<i>Luca was right behind me.</i>

[Trevor] Boss, we've got another image.

[Grant]<i> What is it?</i>

333
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:48,140
Some kind of diamond pattern.

334
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,850
I don't know.

335
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,605
There's something behind it,
but we can't make out what it is.

336
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,649
Diamonds...

337
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,905
Like a fence?

338
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,951
What's beyond the fence, Hall?

[keyboard clacking]

A face.

342
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,389
Give me a sec.

343
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,777
Boss, I think... I think we...
have our shooter.

344
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,905
It's Luca.

345
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:49,368
[Hall]<i> Luca betrayed me.</i>

346
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,870
How did you make me remember that?

347
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,622
You made that choice, not me.

348
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:56,584
No, no, no, no, no,
you wanted to shove that in my face.

349
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,336
Because you and your team
are so fucking perfect.

350
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,357
I've never doubted your loyalty, Hall.

351
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,759
[sighs] All right. Well... thanks.

352
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,515
You know, I kind of always felt, um...

353
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,142
You know, you and me, we should, uh...

354
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,230
MacLaren?

[footsteps approaching]

It wasn't me.

357
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,427
Leave him.

358
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:51,971
[Luca] Not like this.

359
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,265
Help me.

00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,748
Go. I'll deal with it.

365
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,002
Be quick. We gotta move.

366
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,217
I'm sorry.

The...

368
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,639
The Director's gonna find you.

369
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,642
Lucky you taught me how to hide.

[Kyle sighs] Since we don't know
if we're gonna get out of here or not,

373
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,081
I'm gonna break Protocol Two.

374

[grunts]

375
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,714
[sighs] I came to the 21st after you.

376
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,384
I mean, I studied you guys.
The missions you did.

377
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,887
Your team pulled off some serious shit.

378
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,305
Yeah.

379
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,019
And nothing got better,
no matter what you did.

380
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,271
You know what I was thinking?

381
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,458
This morning, the Director sent
a historian to an update

382
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,067
knowing full well it would kill him.

383
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,069
Brutal.

384
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,113
It led that poor bastard to his death.

385
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,240
No update, no tell.

386
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:38,162
- That's exactly what I'm saying...
- But we can't seriously help the Faction.

387
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,915
Well, I saved that cop today.

388
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:45,878
And all I had to do was tell them
when and where a man was gonna die.

389
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,256
You also prevented a Traveler
from arriving in the 21st.

390
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:53,135
Maybe, if the Director had chosen him
as a candidate. But we don't know.

391
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:56,513
I mean, at the end of the day,

392
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,685
how would you feel if you'd let Aleksander
die the way that he was supposed to?

393
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:10,778
[knocks]

394
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,199
Tell Dawn I'm ready to talk.

[heart monitor beeping]

396
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:21,830
Is he still with us?

397
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,999
[sighs] He is,
but he could code at any minute.

398
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,044
Haven't had an image on the box
since we saw Kyle holding the gun.

399
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:27,961
That doesn't tell us where.

400
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,130
You said before
that he can hear what we're saying.

401
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,342
Well, honestly,
I was just trying to be respectful.

402
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,386
No, but it is possible. I mean,
he has enough neuro-stimulant in him.

403
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
Hall.

404
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,934
If you can hear me, I need your help.

405
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:46,605
Do you know where Kyle and Luca are?
We think that's where Philip is too.

406
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,399
A landmark, an intersection, anything.

407
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,821
- I only remember what you remember.
- Right, 'cause you're not here.

408
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:57,699
No. And yes.

409
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,119
[sighs] We were a good team, you and me.

410
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,513
Remember that mission where we had to...

411
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,935
blow up that bridge
in the middle of the night

412
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,837
'cause it was gonna collapse
the next morning during rush hour?

413
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,464
Yeah. We saved hundreds of lives.

414
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,094
And still, the cops were lookin' for us
for days, you know, and...

415
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,596
[chuckles]

416
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,849
We holed up in that juvie hall.

417
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,438
Wait a minute.

418
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,874
I've been here before. I know this place.

419
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,530
It was a great place to hide.

00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,384
Nice work, Agent Hall.

423
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:44,723
- Ah. Fuck you, you're not even here.
- Yet here I am.

[chuckles]

426
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:53,607
So, now what? Never died before.

427
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,276
Nice day for a walk.

428
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,029
Yeah, it is.

429
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:15,671
Hey, MacLaren, save the world for me.

430
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,006
Let's go.

431
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,512
- I can't leave him.
- No. Go be with your team, I'll stay. Go.

432
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,351
- [Marcy] Thank you.
- Yep.

433
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,274
[David] People, they get stuck
in their own problems.

434
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,359
And I find that sometimes it helps to...

435
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,861
see how worse off
other people's lives are.

436
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,366
I'm a cop. I've worked the street before.

437
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,910
Yeah. Can you name one person
who lives down here?

438
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,623
Okay, let's meet one.

439
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:56,753
Hey, Sam!

440
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,672
How's it going today?

441
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,091
[girl] Traveler 5416.

442
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,970
Provide tactical support
at 532 Industrial Parkway, immediately.

443
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,017
You should go home.

444
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,526
- What was that?
- What?

445
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,472
The kid. Where did she come from?

446
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,823
I don't know. I told her to go home.

447
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,285
Yeah. Smart.

448
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,038
Um... I was gonna introduce you to Sam.

449
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:34,416
Uh, there's this AA meeting
that I really wanna go to right now, so...

450
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,619
Oh, great, I'll go with you.

451
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,867
No. No, you're doin' your thing,
I'll call you tomorrow.

452
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,921
Okay. Well, I'm good mid-afternoon,

453
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,631
- if you want to...
- I'll see you then!

454
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:44,759
Uh-huh.

455

[heart monitor beeping]

456
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,424
- This only helps us monitor your vitals.
- Yeah, I know what it does.

457
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,259

[Mitch]<i> Left is good.</i>

460
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,268
Left it is.

[panting]

465
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,467
I knew they got to you.

466
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,188
Director sent me. Tactical support.

467
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,967
- We'll take it.
- You're with me.

468
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,059
- We'll go around back. You take the front.
- Comms on.

469
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:32,075
- You don't have to do this.
- [Kyle] The Director is failing, Philip.

470
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,191
There is no Grand Plan anymore.

471
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,663
So that's it?
You guys just call yourself Faction now?

472
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,040
Mm. You can, too.

473
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Not really.

- Yeah.

477
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,060
- There's others.
- We know.

478
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,445
- Could use some back up.
- We just found Philip. We're coming.

479
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,072
Find the historians. Jeff.

[man grunts]

[bullets whizzing]

Don't move!

484
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,554
- We're on the same side.
- Shut the fuck up

485
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,046
and give me the keys to the cells.

486
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,469
I understand that you have your doubts...

487
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,345
Keys.

Cover me.

491
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,361
Trevor, cover me.

492
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,778
Shit.

[keys jangling]

494
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,086
- Thought you said you weren't a murderer.
- I'm not.

495
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,794
- You're going to face the Director.
- Yeah, 'cause that's somehow different?

496
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,260
Look, how you reconcile my death
is up to you.

497
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,054
But I meant what I said.

498
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,016
The future needs us to work together.

499
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:02,809
No, don't!

Jeff?

503
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,570
What are you doing here?

504
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,615
You kidnapped all those people.

505
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,745
Not just people. Those are Travelers.
They had the information that we need...

506
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,250
You're one of them.

Nathan?

He's fine. They weren't tortured.

Wait. Is Hall...

Uh, he's still with us. Just.

518
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,014
Do me a favor. Let him know.

519

Will do.

You drive good for a newbie.

Newbie?

528
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,428
That's a new one.

00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:28,473
Yeah. It just means new.

530
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:30,517
I got it.

- Um...

You know what, I'm not sure.

533
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,067
Haven't had a minute
to clean out the car yet.

534
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,747
It's his birthday this week.

535
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:03,633
I met the mother.

536
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,970
Good family?

537
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,220
Yeah.

538
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:11,724
Yeah. I could tell she already loved him.

539
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:16,770
He's, uh...

540
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:22,527
- He's in a healthy environment now.
- I'm happy to hear that.

Me, too.

I'll make us some dinner.
You're probably hungry.

544
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:46,551
Yeah, I could eat.

545
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,429
Wait 'til you try my veggie stir-fry.
It's all about the spices.

546
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,140
Okay, I'll give you a hand
with that in a sec.
