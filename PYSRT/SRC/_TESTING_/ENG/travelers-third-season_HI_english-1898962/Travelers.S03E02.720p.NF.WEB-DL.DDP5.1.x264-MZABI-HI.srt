1
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,555
These so-called "Travelers"
have been exposed.

2
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,349
Not by the mainstream media.

3
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,392
They've moved on to the next news cycle.

4
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,895
Not by our government
or its intelligence agencies.

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,647
They're already covering it up.

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,483
Vincent Ingram,

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,487
once a whistle-blower
to a bona fide invasion from the future,

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,907
is now a prisoner
accused of terrible crimes.

9
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,951
A madman, they insist,

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,996
who went off his meds
and now denies everything he said.

11
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,833
Why did it come to this?

12
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:46,338
Because among the many thousands
of Travelers,

13
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,924
some have taken positions of power.

14
00:00:50,092 --> 00:00:52,052
Others seek it even now.

15
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,180
This man intends to do the same.

16
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,848
Daniel Sosa,

17
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,143
former aide to the late congressman,
Ted Bishop,

18
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,063
now running to replace his seat
in the house.

19
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,232
And we have reason to believe

20
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,694
that not only is Sosa
one of these Travelers,

21
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,237
but he's also responsible

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,990
for the assassination
of Congressman Bishop himself.

23
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:18,620
We cannot allow them
to infiltrate our politics further.

24
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:20,539
We must stop Daniel Sosa

25
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,333
and send a message to these interlopers
from the future

26
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,295
that we are in charge of our country
and of our fate.

27
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,757

- [woman] Great.

But my source
managed to get his hands on one.

36

[Christopher] Well, let's see it.

37
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,211
Okay. But to make sure
it doesn't disappear,

38
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:53,280
it stays on this air-gapped computer
until Thursday's special.

- Yeah.

40
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,659

Hey. You're up early this morning.

Well, go back to bed.

00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,138
I mean, pretend that everything
is all right, that we're all right.

00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,058
- Because we're not.
- What? Of course we are.

Yeah. I just... I just broke a cup.

No.

65
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,318
Shouldn't you be at work already?

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,379
Well, I just wanted to see you
before you took off to your mom's

67
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,256

Well, I can talk and squat

Nothing would be wrong if it wasn't
immediately following a kidnapping.

- You have a history of PTSD.
- Yeah, I know.

108
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,466
Something's gotta give,
and I do not want it to be us.

109
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,260
So I got to thinking,

110
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,930
how is it that you can go out
day and night as an FBI doctor,

111
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,474
and I only know a tiny fraction
of what you do,

112
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:54,354
and then have tea
and play board games with me

113
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,981
as if none of that ever happened.

114
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,524
- Training is...
- No. See, its...

115
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,568
Yeah, it's training.

116
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,570
So that's what I'm doing.

117
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,905

throws at me.

Mr. Sosa.

00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,899
What do you think is behind
Christopher Rockwell's accusations

123
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,110
that you're attempting to manipulate
our political system?

124
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,903
Well, I guess
if I really was from the future,

125
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,095
I'd know the answer to that.

126
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,182
Look, Rockwell has zero journalistic
credentials or experience.

127
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,685
In other words,
he's a purveyor of fake news.

128
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,439
And if he doesn't stop this,
eventually, someone's gonna get hurt.

Why?

Why?

- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me that.

- The timeline has changed.
- No, not everything.

Hell, I moved out at your age.

from my first apartment.

00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,972
Hey, hey!

164
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,849
Fresh start, right, roomie?

165
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,568
Do you know how many hard working men
and women had to look elsewhere

166
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,654
for employment because of Bishop's vote
on the pipeline?

167
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,366
With me, you're getting a job creator.

168
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,450
[Katie] Honey?

169
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,910
Have a great day.

170
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,212
I'm sorry, my dear. Duty calls.

171
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,424
Once this is all over and you win,

172
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,760
promise me you'll learn
when to turn it off.

173
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,511
All right.

174
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,603
- Get down!

Katie.

182
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,549
Katie.

[indistinct chattering]

00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,486
- Agent MacLaren.
- Agent Yates.

187
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,030
- Oh, so you know that I'm your...
- My new partner.

188
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,740
Yes, I've been fully briefed.

189
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,952
Please, have a seat.

190
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,747
I see you gave yourself the big office.

191
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,165
This will only take a minute.

192
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:31,005
Special Agent Grant MacLaren,

193
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,259
the following is a summary
from the Department of Justice

194
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,511
in accordance with
the Office of Government Ethics,

195
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,889
federal regulations, Title Seven,
and the Conflict of Interest, Title 19,

196
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,641
- USG-37.
- Great.

197
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:45,728
To ensure that every designated
FBI liaison have complete confidence

198
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,689
in the integrity of the Traveler program,

199
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,859
each Traveler team
shall respect and adhere

200
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,542
to the fundamental principles of the FBI

201
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,697
as implemented in regulations 301
of this order.

202
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,031
Why wouldn't they?

203
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:01,369
As your designated liaison,
I, Special Agent Joanne Yates,

204
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,705
will act as governing party over your team

205
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,374
and engage with my superiors in good faith

206
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,835
regarding ethical, moral,
and legal matters

207
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,462
stemming from your team's presence
in the 21st century.

208
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,842
Please acknowledge that you understand
the terms of this agreement.

209
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,301
Sure thing.

210
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,095
- We done?
- Not even close.

211
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,265
We have a lot of ground to cover.

212
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,182
Such as?

213
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:25,560
I'm gonna need you to brief me
on your team,

214
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,980
your mandate, operations... the future.

215
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,815
Sorry, that is Protocol 5.

216
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,109
Which means
that when we're in the FBI office,

217
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,445
we do FBI work unless otherwise directed.

218
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,156
- You do know that I know?
- Oh, well, if you know...

219
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,116
Obviously not everything.

220
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,910
- Who knows everything?
- I have my orders.

221
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:45,371
I also have orders,
and one of them, Protocol 2,

222
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,832
is that I can't tell you anything.

223
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,795
The FBI is now a governing body
over the Traveler program.

224
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,464
Okay.

225
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,843
The Director acknowledges
that authorities have become aware

226
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,095
of Traveler operations in the 21st.

227
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,057
That is in everybody's best interest
that those actions,

228
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,101
both past and future,
be kept from the general public

229
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,897
and that the Director itself
will inform the said authorities

230
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,983
of further actions
if and when it sees fit.

231
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,486
That's not how we see it.

232
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,073
- MacLaren...
- Please call me "Mac." We're partners.

233
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,742
You wanna look over my shoulder, fine,

234
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,954
just so long as it doesn't interfere
with my mission,

235
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:30,333
which I think I am allowed to tell you,
is to save the fucking world.

236
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,253
Back to work?

237
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,923
The FB doesn't I all by itself.

238
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,020
[beeping]

239
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,563
Close your eyes, Philip.

240
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,816
How could you possibly know
that I opened my eyes?

241
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,234
We're almost done.

242
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,446
Take a deep, cleansing breath and focus.

243
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,721
We should be working on the device.
We're on a tight timeline.

244
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,464
This will help us concentrate on our work.

245
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:07,996
I don't need help concentrating.

246
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,163
Yeah, you do.

247
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
Okay.

248
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,419
Focusing.

Uh, let's punt
the oligarch story to the third segment.

00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:30,892
- Okay.

What?

268
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,119
It's a video from a hacktivist group

positioned in a few
Eastern European countries.

They're taking the threat seriously.

282
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,225
You and I are providing protection
for Christopher Rockwell

That was a longer walk than I expected,

We're here.

We'll wait another 20 minutes
unless there's a text.

Short and sweet.

Yeah, I'm trying to break a habit.

303
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,355
So, how's Kathryn MacLaren?

304
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,439
Fine.

305
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,692
That wasn't a full-throated "fine."

306
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,569
Well, really, I am.

307
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,324
David, my last encounter
with a psychologist

308
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,950
was not a pleasant one. Don't push me.

309
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:35,620
[chuckles] No.
I'm not even remotely qualified, but...

310
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,764
I'd be happy to be your social worker
should you become homeless.

311
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,209
Oh, well, pretty close to it. [chuckles]

312
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
Really?

313
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,797
No. I'm just staying with my mother
for a few days.

314
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,383
But I'm not rushing back home
to Grant anytime soon.

315
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,260
You don't blame him.

316
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,680
Ingram was obviously insane.

317
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,226
And I already knew Grant cheated on me,
and we dealt with that.

318
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,102
It... It's just that...

319
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,565
I've felt like this before, with him.

320
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,528
There's this black hole of memory
where there should be something.

321
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,530
- They did drug us.
- No, I know.

322
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,366
Because they were gonna take us somewhere
and do terrible things.

All of this is... It's hard to live with.

You know, maybe, uh...

328
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,982
talking about this with a professional,
one who isn't under duress,

329
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,053
might actually help.

Child services took Jeffrey
away this morning.

I'm so sorry.

336

I've always believed in Protocol 1,

337

but... my heart is telling me
that a mother should put her son first,

338
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
not her mission.

339
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,348
Well, in the grand scheme of things,
they're both the same.

340

You're doing everything in your power
to give Jeffery Jr. a world to grow up in.

You just gotta keep reminding yourself

This morning's assassination attempt

and the slaying of his wife
was not random.

357
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:29,210
Travelers have simply tried to cut ties
with a compromised operative.

358
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,005
We struck a nerve by exposing
their underground network,

but this is only the beginning.

confirming that they are now after me.

- Hold on. Cut.

We need to speak with you.

We're here to protect you.

Getting hungry yet, Agent Yates?

00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,178
My friends call me Jo.

376
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,724
Well, hopefully, we get to be friends.

377
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,310
What's this?

378
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,743
You asked me
to bring something for dinner.

379
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,651
This is what dinner eats.

380
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,241
So, what, everyone's a vegan in the future
'cause there's no animal protein?

00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,787
Come on, give me something.

00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,084
How bad is it?

383
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,494
That's just a different way
of asking the same question.

384
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,047
- So it's bad.
- [phone vibrating]

385

Then again, why would you come back
in time to change history

00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:10,769
Same here.

391
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,734
So how long have you been married?

392
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,235
Ten years.

393
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,322
But it hasn't been ten years for you.

394
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,619
I'm told when a Traveler arrives,
their consciousness supplants the host's.

395
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,872
We only take hosts
who were historically about to die.

396
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,918
Oh. He told me something.
That is if you're telling me the truth.

397
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,296
That is what we do.
It's hard-wired into the Director.

398
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,716
Okay, but even so. I mean, you can't
have been with her for more than what,

399
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
a year?

400
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,894
That's enough time
to make a real connection.

401
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,346
I don't know how real it could be.

402
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,390
We're just as human as you are, Jo.

403
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:57,149
Is it painful for a host
when an incoming consciousness takes over?

404
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,569
Yes. But it's fairly quick.

405
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,989
[scoffs] You make it sound like
you're doing them a favor.

406
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:10,287
Well, my host would have bled out alone
at the bottom of an elevator shaft.

407
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,414
Kat would've ended up a widow.

408
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,251
And most of the good we've done
would never have happened.

409
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:17,962
So, yes, we are.

410
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,593
My mother died a couple of days ago.

411
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:29,265
She had a series of strokes,

412
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:33,060
and the last one was so massive,
she couldn't speak.

413
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,647
Because there was really no one inside
anymore to form words.

414
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:38,774
But she did speak.

415
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,278
Your Director used her to send a message.

416
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:48,200
Her last words weren't even her own,
and they ended her life.

417
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,996
Forgive me for not thanking you.

423
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:50,679
Did some sit-ups.

424
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,182
But I lost count.

425
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,493
You know, in order for your muscles
to strengthen,

426
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,061
they need a lot of rest, right?

427
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,688
The guy in the Pilates infomercial
said that.

[Marcy chuckles]

429
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:04,735

- All right. You know what?

00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,253
Mining Ethereum.

435
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,482
I used a root kit to subvert
a super computer's processing power

436
00:24:26,507 --> 00:24:28,092
to unlock the next chain in the block.

437
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:32,971
I made $80,000 in 27 minutes. [chuckles]

438
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,057
By stealing from people's accounts?

439
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:38,102
No. Technically,
keeping the whole system afloat.

440
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,560
- If anything, I did a good thing.
- Well, you know what eventually happens.

I was about to shoot you?

00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:14,804
Nothing.

It's, uh, making me better.

Yeah, I know. I can see that. What is it?

- Yeah, it's a new blend.

479
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:29,189
- "Jurassic Dark".
- Huh. Yeah, it looks pretty dark.

480
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,441
- Yeah. I think it's the legal maximum.
- Hmm.

481
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:37,614
Oh. Is that even coffee?

482
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,868
For God's sakes, Marcy,
where's your sense of adventure?

483
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:44,996
[slurps]

484
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,166
[moans] That is not good.

485
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,835
- [chuckles]
- [spits, groans]

486
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,296
- Ah.
- Here.

487
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,381
Have you pulled a muscle?

488
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,427
Yeah, um, all of them.

489
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,221
Took me five minutes
to walk to the kitchen.

490
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,141
You know, too much exertion's
dangerous, David.

491
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,321
If you're in this much pain,
maybe you should take the day off work.

492
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,814
- Like you'd ever take a day off of work?
- I take whole days off all the time.

493
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,734
I know, and those are my favorite days.

494
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,361
But if you had to, like, I don't know,

495
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,364
stop an assassination or...

496
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:24,411
- or prevent a volcano from erupting...
- That's not possible.

497
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,288
Just for discussion purposes.

498
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,748
If you had to,

499
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,112
never in a million years
would you take a day off of work.

500
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,128
- Well, what I do is...
- Important?

501
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,686
"Take the day off because you're stiff,"
that's what you suggested.

502
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:39,635
I don't even really know
what it is that you do, but I respect it.

503
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,053
I respect what you do.

504
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:47,726
I think that it is important
and honorable,

505
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:49,353
and I respect you.

506
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,940
Okay?

507
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,367
Just you and me today.

508
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,458
Going for a ride, yeah.

509
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,169
Yay, we'll go for a ride.

510
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,922
- Yeah, we're going for a ride.
- [baby whines]

511
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,383
[grunts] Come on. All right.

512
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,261
That's all right. Right arm. Good job.

513
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,306
Okay, left arm. Good job. Good job.

514
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,225
There you go.

515
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:29,976
Locked in.

516
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,312
All safe.

517
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,947
- Hey, you got a sec?
- Sure.

518
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,476
What happened? You hurt yourself?

519
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,534
Nope.

520
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,430
You're standing like you kinda really need
to use the bathroom.

521
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,581
Yeah. Well, maybe I do, Ken.

522
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,917
Okay, I'll be quick. I need a favor.

523
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,587
I need you to take my spot
at the HIV Awareness seminar on Saturday.

524
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,505
Ah, can't do that.

525
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,983
I know you hate speaking in public,

526
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,009
but Melissa's sick,
which means I'm on dad duty.

527
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:04,112
You'll be great.
I already put your name down.

528
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,304
Ken, I said no.

529
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:07,323
Don't let me keep you.
We can talk about it after.

530
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,767
I'm saying you can't just put my name down
like I'm some sort of

531
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,478
name... that you put down.

532
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,481
Oh. Look, I didn't mean to...

533
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,775
I'm just... [stammers] I'm giving notice

534
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:20,736
that I'm not gonna be
pushed around anymore.

535
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,490
[scoffs] Well, hey,
forget I said anything.

536
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,118
I'll ask Kirk. He can use the overtime.

537
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,495
Wait, there's overtime?

538
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,087
- [horn honking]
- [mouths] Hey, sorry.

539
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,383
[siren chirping]

540
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,927
Shit.

541
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,432
- All right, all right.
- [baby crying]

542
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:52,434
[woman] Come on, throw it.

543
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,290
There's nothing to worry about,
little man.

544
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,024
[baby whining]

545
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,192
We got this.

546
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,534
Jeff?

547
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:11,911
Hey, brother.

548
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,665
- How's it goin'?
- How about you tell me?

549
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,817
Just going to the park with my son.

550
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:22,589
- I need you to step out of the car.
- Come on, man.

551
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,632
- You ain't gotta do that.
- Out of the car, Jeff.

552
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,144
All right.

553
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,333
I'm placing you under arrest for suspicion
of driving under the influence.

554
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,483
Are you fucking serious?

555
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,044
- [cries]
- You have the right to remain silent.

556
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:45,946
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

557
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,990
What are you doin'? I'm a cop, man.
What about my kid?

558
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:50,325
Yeah, what about him, Jeff?

559
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:53,412
You have the right to an attorney.

560
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,615
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

561
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:06,758
Who's Victor Sabatini?

562
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,345
Are we protecting the wrong person?

563
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:12,931
- Rockwell's my stage name.
- Ah.

564
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:15,851
Do you have a problem with me?

565
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,979
You've ruined two lives this week already.

566
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,231
Haven't you done enough?

567
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,526
A good story's a good story.
It's not personal.

568
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,570
Tell that to Daniel Sosa.

569
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,820
[chuckles]

570
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:30,323
At the end of the day,
I don't really give a damn

571
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,867
if something is true or not true.

572
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,370
It's whether or not
I can convince people to believe it.

573
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,248
- I'm not a really a reporter.
- No.

574
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,458
I'm a businessman.

575
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:42,836
This is about money.
I use my celebrity to sell things.

576
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,881
And if I can make people believe
something that's very hard to believe,

577
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,133
and that only I know the truth...
[clicks tongue]

578
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,254
...I can sell them anything.

579
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,804
What if I told you it was true?

580
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,350
That there's a network of Travelers
trying to change history,

581
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:58,268
and I'm one of them.

582
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,395
- [chuckles]
- What happened to Protocol 2?

583
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,439
I would say you were trying
to sell me something.

584
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,982
No. I'm trying to warn you.

585
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,525
Don't do this.

586
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,156
Well, we all gotta do what we gotta do.

587
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,033
[keys jangle]

588
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,201
Let's go, Traveler.

589
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,249
[Marcy] <i>We're arriving now.</i>

590
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,583
On our way.

591
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,711
[Carly] I'm up in five.

592
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:32,628
Are you sure it's gonna work?

593
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,548
Tested it twice. We're good.

594
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,141
Anybody ever hear of Protocol 2H?

595
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,398
Trev, you know that means
I can't talk about it.

596
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:43,188
The "H" is for Historian.

597
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,815
- That much he told me.
- Please drop it.

598
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,568
But you said
that it was Traveler-approved,

599
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,572
so I'm curious
if these guys ever heard about it.

600
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:53,156
- Not me.
- 'Cause he takes pills for it.

601
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,283
- So I figured you might know.
- What kind of pills?

602
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,785
Jesus, Trev.

603
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,245
Show me.

604
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,213
No, I don't recognize them.

605
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,883
- Give me one to examine.
- I can't do that.

606
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,927
- [scoffs]
- You don't need to tell me.

607
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,572
- I'll just figure it out for myself.
- Is it something you're ashamed of?

608
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,598
- No.
- Then give the woman a damn pill

609
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:22,143
- so we can get on with the mission.
- I can't. I... [groans]

610
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,981
I'm fine. I'm not high.

611
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,899
You guys just have to trust me.

612
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,364
All right, I'm up.

613
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,123
[door opens]

614
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:46,751
[door closes]

615
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,799
[man] Your kid was in the back seat
and you blew double the limit.

616
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:55,760
I can't turn a blind eye to that.

617
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:02,100
We'll, uh, write up an administrative
charge for your license, but...

618
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,146
you're suspended
until your disciplinary hearing.

619
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,524
And I'm gonna need your badge.

620
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,109
Where's Jeffrey?

621
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,113
Washington Family Services.

622
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,532
He's a regular there now.

623
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,370
Jeff,

624
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,455
get some help.

625
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:34,674
[door opens, closes]

[beeping]

629
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,659
My screen's telling me
the alarm system's gone offline on 2.

630
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,869
[Philip]<i> Do me a favor
and go check it out for me.</i>

631
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,622
The new girl's on her way,
and I'd rather you do it.

632
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,705
[Trevor]<i> Copy.</i>

633
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,452
You take over.
The boss wants me to check something out.

634
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,505
Okay.

635
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:16,465
Whatever.

636
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:42,784
[scanner beeps]

637
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,396
Any sign of the target?

638
00:37:13,106 --> 00:37:14,232
[Philip] <i>Sixty seconds.</i>

639
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:17,694
You know, I kinda wish
you really were from the future

640
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,655
so you'd know exactly when this
assassination attempt was gonna happen

641
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,419
and you wouldn't have to follow me around.

642
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,491
Oh, I do know when.

643
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:25,785
Hang tight.

644
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,955
If this act of yours is to try and stop me
from doing this show,

645
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,039
I will have your job.

646
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,125
I have first amendment rights.

647
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,086
All clear.

648
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,963
Please, after you.

649
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,678
Hi. I'm Kiera.
I'll be doing your makeup today.

650
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,305
- Lucky me.
- [chuckles]

651
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,014
[Marcy] It's this way.

652
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,877
Hi. ID, please.

653
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:25,970
Oh, my God. You're...

654
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,225
I am so sorry for your loss.

655
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:34,312
- I have an interview with Drew Clarkson.
- Uh...

656
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,273
They called last minute,
so I'm not sure if they logged it in yet.

657
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,485
That must be why.

658
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,154
Uh, you know what? Go ahead.

659
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,283
Uh, and once again, I'm so sorry.

660
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,452
Studio 41, fourth floor.

661
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:50,786
Thank you.

662
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:55,667
[telephone ringing]

663
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:57,793
[scanner beeps]

664
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,089
He's in the building.

665
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,937
Stepping off the elevator
on the fourth floor.

666
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,330
[Trev] Got him.

667
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,626
Before you do your interview,
I'd like to fact-check you on something.

668
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:40,879
Okay.

669
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,673
Daniel Sosa
didn't kill Congressman Bishop.

670
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,967
The man was shot
with a high-caliber sniper round

671
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,720
fired by my team's tactician
two blocks away.

672
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,054
Her name is Carly,

673
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,974
and she's the one on the video
you intend to show tonight.

674
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,327
- What the hell are you doing?
- He was shot while having a heart attack,

675
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,061
which was confirmed by the autopsy.

676
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,690
If you check the tape,
you'll see me by the congressman's side

677
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,108
moments after it happened.

678
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,289
You know who else you'll find
in the crowd?

679
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,819
Your makeup artist.

680
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:07,988
Hi.

681
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,534
What the fuck is going on here?

682
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,286
You're being given a choice.

683
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,538
You son of a bitch. I knew it.

684
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,332
MacLaren, knock it off.

685
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,775
If you insist on pursuing this further,
I can't protect you.

686
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,252
- From who? You?
- Stop it.

687
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,756
If you let it go,
find some other bullshit story to sell,

688
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,067
- you get to walk out of here.
- [Trevor] <i>Fifteen seconds, boss.</i>

689
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,093
You've got about 12 seconds to decide.

690
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,220
Marcy, stand by.

691
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,014
[Yates] All right, enough.

692
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,485
- Mr. Rockwell...
- You know what, MacLaren?

693
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,102
Even if it's true,
especially if it's true,

694
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,646
fuck you.

695
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:42,523
Everybody back!

696
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,193
- Stay back!
- Drop your weapon, now.

697
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,296
- You did this to me.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

698
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,197
My wife, Katie,

699
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,450
they killed her because of what you said.

700
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:56,287
- Mr. Sosa, lower your weapon.
- No. No.

701
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,705
Not until he admits the truth.

702
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,414
It was all lies.

703
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,042
Everything.

704
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,170
Say it. Say it!

705
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,049
- I'm sorry about what happened...
- Everything you said about me,

706
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,551
- you made up, and now my wife is dead!
- Listen to me.

707
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,553
It's all true. I swear it.

708
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,931
Look, tell him what you've just told me.

709
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,520
Her, too.
They're both Travelers from the future.

710
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,397
[stammers] It's all true. Tell him!

711
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,291
- You lying son of a bitch.
- [gun cocks]

[MacLaren] I'm Traveler 3468.

717
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,013
Welcome to the 21st.

718
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,556
Thank you.

719
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,813
Give this to your engineer
when your team makes contact.

720
00:42:04,564 --> 00:42:05,564
[knocking on door]

[door opens]

722
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,494
Mr. Rockwell,
they're waiting for you on set.

723
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,777
I'll be right there.

724
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,323
Yeah, we're his entourage.

725
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,116
Break a leg.

726
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,996
That's just what they say.
It's a good thing.

727
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,926
Okay, what just happened?

728
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,971
We just completed a mission.
You wanted to meet my team?

729
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,181
Here they are.

730
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,354
- We need to arrest him.
- Why?

731
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,356
He didn't do anything.

732
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,025
[Marcy] I gave him a memory inhibitor.

733
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,919
He'll forget the last 24 hours
ever happened.

734
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,653
And clearly, he was about to kill.

735
00:42:58,367 --> 00:42:59,367
You knew.

736
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,748
That's why we were assigned
to protect him.

737
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,085
[Philip] Daniel Sosa historically killed
Christopher Rockwell

738
00:43:07,168 --> 00:43:08,586
at 3:16 p.m. this afternoon.

739
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,797
But instead of going to prison,

740
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:13,758
he's gonna wake up at home
with a hangover.

741
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,763
You left me in the dark.

742
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,974
We should go.
You need to get him out of here.

743
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:29,649
You set him up.

744
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,412
I gave him a choice.
You heard it yourself.

745
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,277
Not one he could make. Not a real one.

746
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:34,641
You may as well have killed him.

747
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:36,405
You know Sosa was about to.

748
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,158
Yeah, because his wife was killed.

749
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,786
Because the shooters
thought her husband was one of you.

750
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,015
You could have stopped him.
It's completely circular logic.

751
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,209
Actions have repercussions, not just ours.

752
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,671
With every new change, the Director
chooses the best path forward.

753
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:54,048
Yeah, and how's that
working out for you so far?

754
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,637
Ah, right. Never mind.

755
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:01,930
Protocol 2.

756
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,395
[crowd applauding]

757
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,074
[Philip] It's on.

758
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,828
You know, I gotta confess.

759
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,665
I knew corn existed,
I knew popcorn existed,

760
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,875
never made the connection.

that it stops now.

No.

780
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,886
Fine. I'll talk to you.

781
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,763
Go sleep it off, Jeff.

782
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,046
I'm sure things will look very different
in the morning.

Oh, was that a threat?

784
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,268
Doesn't have to be.

785
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,313
You see, I remember things.

786
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,441
I know who you are.

787
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,069
I know what you are.

788
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:22,819
I wonder if Kathryn knows.

789
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,033
We're friends now. Maybe I'll ask her.
