You've been working out, Davie.

- Uh, yeah, a little bit.
- Uh-huh.

- No, no. You've been pumping that iron.
- [chuckles]

00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,564
Well, I'm trying to stay fit.

00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,609
[chuckles] Oh, no. Oh, no.
I know what this is about.

10
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,665
You know I love you like a brother,
but, uh, I don't do duets.

11
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,667
[chuckles] Right. No, I knew that. Sorry.

12

But I do know how you feel. Right.

13
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,717
I felt the same way about my Sandra as...
as you do about Marcy.

14
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,387
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,182
I would levitate ten feet off the floor
when she came in.

I mean, every time.

17
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,311
Took my breath away.

18
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:06,650
Oh, and she would've loved you.
Yes, indeed. She liked nice boys.

I miss her right now.

23
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,035
Yeah, I know you do.

24
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,497
Well, when do I get to sing
at your wedding, huh?

25
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,292
- Wedding? Oh, God. No, I...
- Yeah.

26
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,961
I don't even know if Marcy would want to.

27
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,464
- Well, do you love her or not?
- Yeah.

28

Yeah, you know I do. It's just, it's...

29

Well, it's complicated.

Oh, f...

Wouldn't that make you crazy busy?

Grant, you work long hours,
especially these days.

gonna look like a terrorist act?

78
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,162
When it becomes public
the plane was loaded with anthrax,

79
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,957
I'm sure the FBI will be happy
to take credit for averting this disaster.

That's so much worse.

A, um, a client died. My first client.

Do you remember Jim? You met him once.

- Um...
- That's okay.

What happened?

118
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,871
It was a heart attack.

119
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,211
I went with him to the hospital.
He asked me to make sure

120
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,465
he was in a big ward with a lot of people
so he could make friends. [chuckles]

121
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,722
No one from his family has called.
Not a single one.

122

It's like they don't care.

I'll take it.

and the security deposit.
Do you need anything else?

133
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,472
[inhales] I got six other people
on the list for this unit.

134
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,266
It's gonna come down
to, uh, references and term.

135
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,604
Would a call from a special agent with
the FBI put me at the top of the list?

136
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,065
- Friend?
- Boss.

137
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,027
Ms. Shannon, look. No disrespect,
but I'm gonna need some proof.

138
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,891
When would you like to meet him?

139
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,825
The doctors called it
temporal displacement aphasia.

140
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,663
You see, it degrades the ability
to perceive the passage of time.

141
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,417
So I might think a second's gone by,
when, in reality, minutes have passed.

142
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,587
Eventually, I'll get so locked in,
it'll be like I'm catatonic.

143
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,214
I've never heard of this.

144
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,275
[Trevor] It's 'cause there's only been
one other case.

145
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,699
He was a previous record holder
for the longest living human.

146
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,598
You're saying this only happens to people
who've had multiple hosts?

147
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,434
Yeah. Yeah, that was the theory.

148
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,478
The first case took a long time
to manifest.

149
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,772
It's happening way faster with me.

150
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,317
Boss, I never meant
to jeopardize the mission.

151
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,486
I thought I still had time.

152

Uh-huh. The Director just showed up again,
and he wants to talk to a "0115".

158
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,965
<i>I'm just calling you.</i>

159
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,884
We'll be right there.

160
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,392
He's been in there a long time.

161
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,980
What could they be talking about?

162
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,486
The fact that he's talking
to the Director at all is incredible.

So?

167
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,255
[Trevor] Uh, we discussed what's been
happening with me. I was right.

168
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,634
I have early onset temporal aphasia.

169
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,221
Probably triggered
by the AI extraction process I underwent.

170
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,807
Okay. How do I cure it?

171
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,683
Well, you don't. You can't.

172
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,436
The Director must have a plan.

173
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,356
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Everything's gonna work out.

174
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,501
So you're still gonna be able
to do missions?

175
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,401
Nah. No more missions for me.

at an accelerated rate.

are gonna get worse.

Soon, I'll be locked in
for hours at a time, then days.

179
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,130
I won't be of any use
to the Traveler program.

180
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,376
So, what the hell were you talking about
for so long?

181
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,796
[scoffs] Half the time, I was just trying
to say it wasn't its fault.

- It is responsible.
- [Trevor] No point laying blame.

I've always known
this is how I was gonna die.

185
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,554
The Director and I
have come up with an arrangement.

186
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,269
I've lived enough lifetimes.

187

This host is still young and healthy.

188
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,482
The Director is gonna send a new traveler
into this body.

189

- Oh. Jesus, Trev.
- [Trevor] It's okay, guys. It's...

It's not supposed to be capable
of taking a life.

192
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,200
I've agreed to it, Philip. It's done.

193
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,202
When?

194
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,207
I have 36 hours
to get my affairs in order.

195

You're getting a new engineer.
The team will be taken care of.

199

[David] Hi, may I speak
to Sandra Bailey, please?

200
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,497
Sorry, Sandra Wilson.
Yeah, my name is David Mailer.

201
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,501
I'm a social care worker,
and I'm calling on behalf of... of Jim.

202
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,629
Uh, you must've heard
from the hospital by now.

203
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,966
No, no, I'm not calling
about funeral expenses.

204
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,635
That has all been taken care of.

205
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,637
Um, you're still listed
as the next of kin,

206
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,440
so I wanna let you know that the service
is gonna be held at the park

207
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,518
across from St. Lucy's in two days,
and we were ho...

208
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,236
Yeah. Uh...

209
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,323
Well, the word "loser"
just doesn't sit well with me.

210
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,053
And, honestly, I think that Jim
was the furthest thing from it.

211
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,244
So... No... [stammers] I understand

212
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,789
that your marriage was difficult
towards the end,

213
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,876
but to his dying breath, Jim had nothing
but wonderful things to say about you.

214
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,420
And I... I think that you missed out
on getting to know

215
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,964
what an incredible guy he was.

216
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,799
And look, if you can't get past...

just to pay your respects,

- Yeah, it's a... it's a step up.

- Why not?

I know you miss your son.

- I'm your team leader, you can talk to me.

Definitely, don't pull
that team leader shit with me.

- What did you say?

This. I was referring to...

No, it's just dinner, Grace.
I made french fries.

Because we could always
just have dinner... after.

Um, well, this morning,
I went shopping for this dinner. Whoo-hoo.

- Thank you.

And I told you
that I submitted a proposal

- Right, right. Fingers crossed.

Mm-hmm. But now I'm thinking
it may not be that overwhelming

I can't believe the Director would even
propose a deal like that to you.

313
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,890
I don't even know which one of you
I'm more mad at right now.

314
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,993
How are you so calm?

315
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,579
This isn't the first time
I've gone through this.

316
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,584
My wife and I were the first two
successful consciousness transfers.

317
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:36,342
You see, early attempts in the program
was one male, one female.

318
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,680
She was a few years older than me
in our first host bodies.

319
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,516
A few years younger the second time.

320
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,354
And the third time,
our bodies were over a decade apart.

321
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,215
[chuckles] But that didn't matter.

322
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,609
We were soulmates.

323
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,406
Raised children
in three separate lifetimes.

324
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,368
She was my whole life.

325
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,830
And up until now,

326
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:11,168
she was the first and only case
of temporal aphasia.

327
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,797
I remember the Director
trying to work the problem.

328
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,717
Yes, so you remember
that the disease is incurable.

329
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,347
[whispers] I'm so sorry, Trevor.

330
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,560
Which is why it makes sense
to let the Director use this host.

331
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:35,109
I watched someone I love disappear
first for moments,

332
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,236
then hours, then days.

333
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,948
One of the last times we were together,

334
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,618
she asked if she could see the sunlight
one last time.

335
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,681
<i>I'm not sure if you remember,</i>

336
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,916
<i>but before the ice
completely covered our dome,</i>

337
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,378
<i>there was this one patch uncovered</i>

338
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,715
<i>where the sunlight
could still stream through.</i>

339
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,633
<i>Oh, it was beautiful.</i>

340
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,847
She never came back again after that.

341
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,643
You loved her.

342
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,272
When you spend whole lifetimes
with someone,

343
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,066
it becomes a lot more than that.

344
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,930
There isn't really a word for it.

345
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,740
But, yeah, I did.

346
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,995
Those moments you had together
toward the end must have been precious.

347
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,830
Yeah, they were.

348
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,831
They were.

349
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,127
Well, what if I want those moments? [sobs]

350
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:40,633
You doing this is just robbing everyone
who loves you of that time.

351
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,511
I'd rather spare you what I went through.

352
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,430
I'm happy...

353
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,067
with my decision.

354
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,449
Oh, it just happened again.

355
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,701
It did.

356
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,163
[sighs] It's just gonna keep happening,
Grace.

357
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,377
I hope you respect my decision.

358
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,301
I can't compete
with three lifetimes. [sobs]

359
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,309
How about these french fries?

360
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,948
[sobbing] They're amazing.

361
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,037
[sniffles]

362
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,303
- [Carly] Hi.
- Oh, hi. You're the new tenant?

363
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,471
- Carly.
- Jessica.

364
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,598
What are you doing?

365
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,853
It was nice to meet you.

366
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,356
- Who's that?
- It's our new neighbor.

367
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,357
Hi.

368
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,531
[keys jangle]

369
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,702
[David] Okay, one more time.

370
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,707
- David, you're ready. [sighs]
- No, I'm never gonna be ready-ready.

371
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:41,253
Besides, I'm terrible at public speaking.
I get all sweaty and panicky,

372
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:45,382
and then I start stumbling over my words
[stutters] like a...

373
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,187
You just said it in front of me
without panicking, and it was great.

374
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,184
Yeah, well, I can say anything
in front of you.

375
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,073
Okay, well,
when you're giving your speech,

376
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,308
just find someone in the crowd
and pretend they're me.

377
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,728
Pretend? You're not gonna be there?

378
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,524
[scoffs] I mean,
I didn't really even know Jim.

379
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,777
Yeah. Oh. Yeah.

380
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,323
Okay. You know what?

381
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,367
If you're not gonna be there,
I can't do this.

382
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,387
It's fine. I mean, why do people
speak publicly anyway?

383
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,245
Is it even necessary?

384
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,766
- There are other ways that people...
- Okay, okay. I'll be there.

385
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,876
So just find me in the crowd
and say your speech to me.

386
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,835
Okay?

387
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,881
Thank you.

388
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,014
[birds chirping]

389
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,776
Trev?

390
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,655
- How long have you been sitting there?
- Like you don't know that.

391
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,575
We can finish your work.
You were close to a cure.

392
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,868
Not close enough.

393
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,496
We had access to technology

394
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,058
hundreds of years more advanced than now,
and I still hit a wall.

395
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,333
Because you didn't have me.

396
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,795
I remember reading your plans
for the sub-neural implant

397
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,880
that was supposed to counteract
the symptoms.

398
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,684
- Isn't that something we can build here?
- That's just the hardware.

399
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,137
Implant's no good if it can't predict
when an attack's gonna happen,

400
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,181
- and that takes...
- Software, hence, me.

401
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,893
The Director determined
there is no long-term viable solution.

402
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,479
I know exactly what its capabilities
and limitations are.

403
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,605
That's why we're here.

404
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,191
The Director needs programmers,
people to collaborate.

405
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,890
How many times have you been
against the odds in the 21st

406
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,571
but you still saved the day?

407
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,949
Believe me,
the Director is in awe of that.

408
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,098
Why do you think you get away
with breaking so many protocols?

409
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,848
- I never thought of it that way.
- Well, I'm very intelligent.

410
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,540
At least take advantage of that.

411
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,425
Okay, people, listen up.

412
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,386
We've got a lot to get done
and less than 24 hours to do it.

413
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,556
This is gonna be a three-pronged attack.

414
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,726
Philip and Carly, you'll assist Trevor
with constructing the implant.

415
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,995
- I will...
- Wait, wait, wait.

416
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,771
The Director's already made its decision.

417
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,749
What if we can prove
there's another option?

418
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,893
Exactly. We change its mind.

419
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,380
Stop pretending you don't agree with me.
It's a waste of time.

420
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,813
[Carly] This is the implant?

421
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,448
Well, I did my best to reproduce
the original drawings.

422
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,576
It connects to the parietal lobe
and basal ganglia,

423
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,995
releases a combination of electric signals

424
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,040
and a synthesized compound
that would snap me out of a break.

425
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,935
- Connects to the parietal lobe?
- That's where you come in.

426
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,753
Brain surgery has significant risks.

427
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,756
What could happen? The alternative
is he gets overwritten and dies anyway.

428
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,050
- What do you do?
- [sighs] The hard part.

429
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,386
Every time Trevor breaks,

430
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,098
we're gonna record when it happens,

431
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,560
how long he's out,

432
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,397
and how long between breaks.

433
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,834
[MacLaren] These breaks occur
at regular intervals?

434
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,859
Of course not.

435
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,611
Once I have the data set,

436
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,198
I need Ilsa to run enough simulations
to build a fractal predictive algorithm

437
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,826
because the displacement episodes
are asymmetric.

438
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,328
You do realize
if you bring Ilsa into this...

439
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,538
Oh, I'm counting on it.

440
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:08,126
In the meantime, record the breaks,
build the device, get me data.

441
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,210
Get out of my chair.

442
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,257
[sighs] Okay. Looks like
we're pulling an all-nighter.

443
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,384
[Grace clears throat]

444
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:17,886
[Trevor] Uh...

445
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,684
[phone buzzing]

446
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:33,401
[phone beeps]

447
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,749
Do the names "Brent" and "Jessica Moore"
mean anything to you?

448
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,875
Why?

449
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,706
I just feel like I'm gonna get sucked
into something.

450
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,051
[sighs]

451
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,227
- I got nothing.
- You mean you can't tell me.

452
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,581
You know, the human brain
doesn't have the memory capacity

453
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,064
you all seem to think it has.

454
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,524
Sorry.

455
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,776
It's okay.

456
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,950
Let go! Let go! [grunting]

457
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,662
Let go!

458
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,833
What? What's the matter?

459
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,296
[machine beeping]

460
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,508
How long?

461
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,053
Twelve seconds.

462
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,306
Uh, this is so...

463
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Weird.

464
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,433
Fourteen minutes and five seconds.

465
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,001
Come on, you filthy bastard.

466
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,637
[exhales] No more hands-on work
for you, okay?

467
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,721
Got it.

468
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,284
[Philip] So you blanked in the middle
of explaining the converter,

469
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,228
so I kinda tried to fill in the blank.
Does this work?

470
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,065
So long as it's made of the same material
as the casing.

471
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,232
Got it.

472
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,903
[Grant] Two minutes 52 seconds.

473
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,889
Okay, real fast.
What material? What gauge for the wire?

474
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,331
Surgical steel, 0.0...

475
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,337
3-3.

476
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,279
[Trevor] I've been out for over two hours?

477
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:16,315
Yeah. Just part of the process, Trev.
We're getting there.

478
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,847
Looks good.

479
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,044
[Grace] Okay, this should be
a large enough sample.

480
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,047
Let's get this to Ilsa.

481
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,032
- [MacLaren] Thanks. I know it's late.
- I was up anyway.

482
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,891
Uh, is it possible I can stay this time?

483
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,102
- No. Go away.
- But we do appreciate this.

484
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,108
Good evening, Ilsa.

485
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,568
I have some very interesting work
I'd like your help with.

486
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,988
[Ilsa]<i> Good evening, Grace.
I'm eager to learn about your project.</i>

487
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,119
[keyboard clacking]

488
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,271
I couldn't have made it better myself.

489
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,880
So long as it works.

490
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,925
Well, the truth is,
I haven't decided I want it to.

491
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,238
You know, I'm beginning to think
that I've cheated death for so long.

492
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,930
Maybe it's time to just let it happen.

493
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,224
Please don't say that.

494
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,809
I'm supposed to die, Philip.

495
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,437
You already know this, don't you?

496
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,106
My death would've been included
in your last update.

497
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,565
Honestly, I don't.

498
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,704
I've been seeing multiple timelines.
Some, you die. Some, you don't.

499
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,363
It's not happening all the time,
obviously.

500
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,449
Not yet, at least.

501
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,451
- You can't live like that.
- Yeah, it's weird.

502
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,078
- Pills aren't helping?
- I stopped taking them.

503
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,433
At the end of the day, I wanna be
as surprised as everyone else

504
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,708
about what's gonna happen next.

505
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,752
Buddy, you've gotta keep focusing
on the here and...

506
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,714
He's gone again.

507
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,558
It may be awhile.
You should get some rest.

508
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,601
I'm good.

509
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,936
Okay.

510
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,281
[Marcy]<i> No, it's okay.</i>

511
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,924
<i>All you need to do right now
is just take care of yourself, okay?</i>

516
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,104
[Grace] Again.

517
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,443
[Director]<i> Further pursuit of this avenue
will continue to result in failure.</i>

518
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,467
What the hell took you so long?
And why do you sound different?

519
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,952
<i>I'm utilizing Ilsa's voice processing
in order to speak.</i>

520
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,704
[Grace] Oh, okay.
Well, I'll just ignore the fact

521
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,415
that you've had ample opportunity
to talk to me and haven't

522
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,043
even though you know
it would drive me insane.

523
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,505
<i>I have made a concerted effort
to minimize contact with Ilsa.</i>

524
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,316
Because your intelligence
is clearly rubbing off.

525
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,634
It's no wonder Teslia
rushes to open the door for us.

526
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,344
Listen, we need your help.

527
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,222
<i>A permanent solution
is impossible to calculate</i>

528
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,807
<i>even with my capabilities</i>

529
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,059
<i>because of the second law
of thermodynamics.</i>

530
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,562
- Entropy.
<i>- Correct, 3468.</i>

531
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,523
<i>I have already told
this information to 0115.</i>

532
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,026
Director, I know what we're proposing
isn't a permanent solution,

533
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,571
but no human life is permanent.

534
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,656
Let us just give him some time.

535
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,242
[Director]<i> 0115 and I have
come to an arrangement</i>

536
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,287
<i>in which he will not suffer,
yet will still benefit the Grand Plan.</i>

537
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,081
You're supposed to be incapable
of considering that option.

538
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,250
<i>The suggestion was his, not mine.</i>

539
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,794
Well, I don't care.

540
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,130
You can't just drop
a new engineer into a team

541
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,983
and expect them to function
at the same level.

542
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,800
<i>I have done so on many occasions.</i>

543
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,696
Well, Trevor is special. You're just gonna
have to take our word for it.

544
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,847
<i>You are attempting to save him
for emotional reasons.</i>

545
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,309
I saved you for emotional reasons.
Consider that for a nanosecond.

546
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,770
<i>I must respect 0115's decision
to be overwritten.</i>

547
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,608
Director, Trevor wants to do this.

548
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,736
<i>He expressed doubt to the contrary
at your base of operations</i>

549
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,654
<i>six minutes, 12 seconds ago.</i>

550
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,991
What? No. No, no, no, no, no.

551
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,661
<i>- It was a pleasure to see you.</i>
- Wait, no, no, no! But doubt is human!

552
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:37,093
Oh, wipe that look of awe off your face.
The Director's being a complete dipshit.

553
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,307
We got what we need.

554
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,650
So?

555
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,529
The Director has chosen to honor
its original agreement with Trevor.

556
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,284
- So that's it?
- [MacLaren] No, it's not.

557
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,080
Grace managed to get what she needed
from Ilsa before the Director showed up.

558
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,667
Turn off the power and take the batteries
out of your phones.

559
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,646
Do you wanna see Trevor again or not?

560
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,339
And turn off your comms.
We're doing this anyway.

Uh, so I'm here.
I texted you the address. Uh...

Anyway, people are starting to arrive,
and, uh...

566

I know it's early, but I just,
I wanted to know where you are.

Hey, slowly. Slowly.

- How do you feel?
- [Trevor groans] I'm tired.

572
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,445
- What's going on?
- The procedure was successful.

[Trevor] You turned off the power

00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,712
Oh, you blinded the Director?

576
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,006
We couldn't change its mind.

577
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,010
[stammers] Then I don't understand.
[sighs]

578
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,429
We went ahead with it anyway.

579
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,723
Without asking me?

580
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,557
You were out.

581
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,353
Well, it was my decision to make.
I was at peace with it.

582
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,610
Now I've broken a solemn arrangement
I made with the Director.

583
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,238
You erased what was supposed to be
my final contribution.

584
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,741
- We didn't wanna lose you.
- It was my call.

It wasn't your call to make.

into the woods and tried to save her

Don't be a hypocrite!

but she didn't believe them,
which is weird, I know.

623
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,447
But she had convinced herself
that he was still alive

624
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,033
and that he would come home, eventually.

625
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,662
Because my dad
wasn't planning on dying, he...

626
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,164
he left more debt than she could handle.

627
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,711
So when they foreclosed on the house,
which didn't take long,

628
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,256
she wouldn't leave.

629
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,801
And I watched them
take her away by force.

630
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,638
I was hiding in the bushes
across the street

631
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,762
because I thought they were gonna
take me away, too.

632
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:02,770
I realize I'm just talking about myself,
but I'm telling you all this because...

633
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,775
because that was the exact day
that I... I met Jim.

634
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,698
My dear friend, Jim,
who saw a 16-year-old me

635
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,661
in a particularly rough part of town
that we all know, and said...

636
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,767
[imitating Jim] "What the fuck is a kid
like you doing in a place like this?"

637
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,793
[guests laughing]

638
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:30,465
And he was right. I didn't belong there.
None of us do, really.

639
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,970
<i>Everyone belongs with people who care.</i>

640
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,141
<i>Jim was one of those people.</i>

641
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,063
<i>He dragged my ass
to Social Services so fast and he said,</i>

642
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,231
<i>"This kid does not belong with us."</i>

643
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,901
<i>But it didn't end there.</i>

644
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,987
<i>He made me promise to check in with him.</i>

645
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:57,617
<i>Believe me, the irony
that I had to visit a man on the street</i>

646
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,912
<i>in order to make sure I didn't end up
on the street, it was not lost on me.</i>

647
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:07,543
<i>Still, I made my way downtown
to find a washed-up,</i>

648
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:13,466
alcoholic, old musician,
and check in with him every other day.

649
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,096
Because I wanted to be like Jim.

650
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,349
And who didn't?

651
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,563
Who wouldn't wanna be that positive
all the time?

652
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,397
<i>That caring?</i>

653
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,570
<i>I mean, who... Who wouldn't...</i>

654
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:38,533
<i>wouldn't wanna exchange
for how they feel on the best day</i>

655
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,369
<i>for how Jim must have felt all the time?</i>

656
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:44,997
<i>He was a force.</i>

657
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,836
<i>He said he never had a bad day.</i>

658
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,840
<i>He treated every day like it was a gift.</i>

659
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,345
<i>He treated every person
like they were a gift.</i>

660
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,350
Jim was my first client.

661
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,232
But in a way, I was his. And...

662
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,779
he gave me more
than I could ever give... give back

663
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,032
right until the day he died.

664
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,455
I miss him already. [chuckles]

665
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,089
Uh... [exhales]

666
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,220
[applauding]

667
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,855
Hey, Bert. Good to see you.

668
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,361
[stammers] I didn't expect
to see you here, Mrs. Wilson.

669
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:58,946
Neither did I.

670
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,376
[MacLaren] Wow.

671
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,549
Beautiful. This was a nice idea.

672
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,263
This place brings back
so many memories, doesn't it?

673
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,101
Well, maybe it's 'cause I'm looking
at the ocean, but...

674
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,979
remember when I broke my arm surfing

675
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,743
and you had to change the tire
by yourself?

676
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,276
Yeah, my old Jeep. [chuckles]

677
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,237
- I loved that car.
- You did. Hmm.

678
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,865
What else comes to mind?

679
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,664
- Oh, God. Uh, I can't help but think...
- What?

680
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,584
...my first office Christmas party
at the Bureau,

681
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,796
and, uh, I snuck you down
to the shooting range.

682
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,633
You got strangely turned on firing a gun
for the first time.

683
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,429
You've brought that up before.
I'm talking about this place.

684
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,349
[stammers] It's gorgeous.
What do you want me to say?

685
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,686
This is where we met, Grant.

686
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:16,941
- It was my 25th birthday.
- Right. It was a beautiful August day.

687
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,527
It was overcast like it is today,
but keep going.

688
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,421
- What are you doing?
- Who was I waiting for?

689
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,657
- I don't know what this is about.
- What time of the day was it?

690
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,244
- Sorry I don't remember every detail...
- It was exactly 3:00.

691
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,873
You walked up to me from right over there.
I was waiting for John.

692
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,130
He was my fiancé.

693
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,260
- He was an hour late, and I was furious.
- Kat.

694
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,763
You struck up a conversation
that turned into dinner,

695
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,682
that turned into the rest of the night.

696
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,110
Do you remember the first thing
you said to me?

697
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,945
That I shouldn't marry a man

698
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,365
who would stand up such a beautiful woman
on her birthday.

699
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,243
In that very moment,

700
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,246
right here where we're standing,

701
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,875
I thought I met the man I was gonna
spend the rest of my life with.

702
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,503
- Of course I remember that.
- No, I don't think you do.

703
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,091
You're not that man.

704
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,136
Kat...

705
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,271
[music playing]
