00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:29,312
a...

3
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:30,313
b-b...

g... girl...

6
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:37,587
now."

7
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:38,933
Marcy?

8
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:41,454
I gotta leave early tonight.
You gonna be all right alone?

9
00:00:43,192 --> 00:00:44,757
I'm... I'm fine.

10
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,758
Don't forget

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,160
to take your break, girl.

12
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:48,161
You work too hard.

13
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:50,697
I won't. I won't.

14
00:00:50,698 --> 00:00:52,350
Bye, Tory.

15
00:01:20,627 --> 00:01:21,759
Don't!

16
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,496
Stop!

17
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:41,770
David gave that to me!

18
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:44,673
David...

19
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:56,184
Ah!

20
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:59,587
Ah!

21
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:02,290
Ah!

22
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,929
Ah!

23
00:03:27,883 --> 00:03:29,316
That's mine.

24
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:31,697
Holy shit.

25
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:36,214
Trevor...

26
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:37,516
You stay down, man.
He's better than you.

27
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:41,219
You can stay down, man!

28
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:42,220
Shut up!

29
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,791
You should've stayed down.

30
00:05:01,274 --> 00:05:02,407
Trevor!

31
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,007
Trevor!

32
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:15,486
Ahh!

33
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:41,811
I concede the fight.

34
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:52,355
Do we need to cut it?

35
00:05:52,357 --> 00:05:53,356
Nah.

36
00:06:27,057 --> 00:06:29,124
Ahh!

37
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:17,070
It's okay.

38
00:07:17,072 --> 00:07:18,171
It's okay. It's almost ready.

39
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:30,766
Carly?

40
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,018
Carly?

41
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,587
You're not coming in like that.

42
00:07:35,076 --> 00:07:37,023
You promised, Jeff.

43
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,258
Come on, Carly. Don't make me mad.

44
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,960
I gotta take a piss.

45
00:07:57,478 --> 00:07:58,744
You're not supposed to be here
when you drink.

46
00:07:58,746 --> 00:07:59,745
Why is he crying?

47
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,046
He's just hungry.

48
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:02,514
Well, then give him something to eat!

49
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,106
I'm warming it up.

50
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,652
What is this shit?

51
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,088
It's baby food.

52
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,590
He's a baby, Jeff.

53
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,532
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot.

54
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,550
Hey, hey, hey, this is bullshit.

55
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:40,884
Yo, come on!

56
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:43,020
Hey, all you're doing is pissing me off!

57
00:09:02,574 --> 00:09:05,042
Listen, I'm sorry.

58
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,676
You make me crazy.

59
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:08,545
You need to go.

60
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,683
All right.

61
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,246
I'm going.

66
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,117
You're up early.

67
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,905
Mwah. The headache wake you?

68
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:12,633
The sound of birds.

69
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,010
You know how stupid it is

70
00:10:16,012 --> 00:10:17,811
to pick a fight before a game?

71
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:20,499
How the hell you supposed to throw
a football with a broken hand?

72
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,116
The doctors are more concerned

73
00:10:22,118 --> 00:10:23,584
with his concussion.

74
00:10:23,586 --> 00:10:26,148
You blow you chance
at a scholarship, superstar,

75
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,288
you better start
learning to flip burgers.

76
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,289
All right.

77
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:30,090
You scoot upstairs. Get ready.

78
00:10:30,092 --> 00:10:32,727
They wanted to see you
again in the morning.

79
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:35,081
Thank you, Mom.

80
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,583
"Thank you, Mom"?

81
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:44,671
Who the hell's that?

82
00:11:31,338 --> 00:11:32,403
Philip Pearson?

83
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,689
Tried to find you at the university.

84
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:36,755
I'm Detective Gower.

85
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:38,791
"Gower"?

86
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:40,586
Your roommate passed away last night.

87
00:11:43,671 --> 00:11:45,743
You don't seem surprised.

88
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:58,209
It's me.

89
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:08,613
- David?
- Yeah.

90
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:12,106
Oh!

91
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,424
That's... not appropriate.

92
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:15,993
Marcy, put some clothes on.

93
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,997
Yeah, I can't, uh...

94
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,467
be your boyfriend, Marcy,
w-we talked about this.

95
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:29,778
What's that?

96
00:12:32,177 --> 00:12:33,477
What happened?

97
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:35,909
Uh... I fell.

98
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:38,333
And you just went home?

99
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:41,661
Oh, kiddo, are you okay? Does it hurt?

100
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:43,219
I'm fine.

101
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,356
Well, I know going to the doctor's

102
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:47,723
not your favorite thing
in the world, but...

103
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:53,096
That's a... That's a nasty cut.

104
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,465
Is this appropriate?

105
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,901
Appropriate?

106
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,485
Sure.

107
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:02,844
Maybe some underwear.

108
00:13:05,845 --> 00:13:07,109
Did Stephen inject himself,

109
00:13:07,111 --> 00:13:08,143
or did you do it for him?

110
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:11,781
What difference does it make?

111
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:14,439
Because your prints were
found on both syringes.

112
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:16,318
I was there, but then I-I left.

113
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,353
Because you knew he was gonna O.D.

114
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:23,491
Yeah, you knew.

115
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:25,894
You know, a phone call to 911

116
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:27,630
could've saved his life.

117
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:30,695
That's cold, Philip.

118
00:13:33,003 --> 00:13:35,002
Either way, you have got a problem.

119
00:13:36,654 --> 00:13:38,940
On top of your drug problem.

120
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,942
I don't have a drug problem.

121
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,110
I know who your dealer is.

122
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:45,079
I know how much you buy every week.

123
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:46,881
I know who your friends are,
and I know where you're from.

124
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:49,417
You have no idea where I'm from.

125
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:51,352
You inject somebody, they O.D.,

126
00:13:51,354 --> 00:13:53,054
that's manslaughter.

127
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,322
I have the right

128
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:55,889
to court-appointed legal counsel, yes?

129
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,792
Sure you don't want to
call your parents instead?

130
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,498
You think you're sick now,

131
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,800
wait till your lawyer shows up.

132
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:10,696
I'm proud of you, you know.

133
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:14,107
What? What for?

134
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:16,977
Only you got
knocked in the head last night,

135
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:18,545
and you're...

136
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:20,848
you know, the naked thing,
that... that was weird,

137
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,017
but otherwise, you're handling
this amazingly well.

138
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,200
Hey. It's Thursday.

139
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,997
It's reading-aloud day.

140
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,912
There's no point in wasting
time sitting on a bus.

141
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:40,209
It's just me. It can be anything at all.

142
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,571
Think I got your favorite.

143
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:45,408
"Police were forced to use tear gas

144
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,542
"to disperse a crowd

146
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:56,910

147
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:59,822
What... What's wrong?

148
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,282
Daddy's coming.

149
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,825
You busy right now?

150
00:15:37,389 --> 00:15:38,760
Not yet.

151
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:40,735
We just got sent a red flag.

152
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,031
Can't you handle it?
I'm all over Jonas Walker.

153
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm in court today and tomorrow.

154
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:47,071
What's the flag?

155
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:48,869
Potential cell.

156
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:51,544
Encrypted communication in the deep web.

157
00:15:52,976 --> 00:15:55,042
I have no idea what I'm looking at.

158
00:15:55,044 --> 00:15:56,543
Analyst who flagged it is hoping

159
00:15:56,545 --> 00:15:58,017
that they're just gamers of some kind.

160
00:15:58,019 --> 00:15:59,646
Who travel, apparently.

161
00:15:59,648 --> 00:16:01,748
Those GPS coordinates correspond

162
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,517
to an abandoned building downtown.

163
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,718
And what's a "T.E.L.L."?

164
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,886
I asked the same question.

165
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:07,654
They ran it and nothing showed up.

166
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,858
Aw, shit, I'm late.

167
00:16:11,641 --> 00:16:13,693
It's probably nothing, but...

168
00:16:13,696 --> 00:16:15,645
Yeah, yeah. I got it. I'll let you know.

169
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:17,263
Have fun in court.

170
00:16:17,265 --> 00:16:19,633
Ha. Make sure Jonas Walker
doesn't shoot anyone

171
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:21,368
while I'm gone.

172
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:24,015
You didn't coach her?

173
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:26,832
No amount of coaching can do that.

174
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,681
You recognize Marcy has a significant
intellectual disability.

175
00:16:35,683 --> 00:16:37,116
Yeah. "Had".

176
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:38,350
I know you want to think

177
00:16:38,352 --> 00:16:39,418
something wonderful's happened here,

178
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,953
but no traumatic brain injury

179
00:16:40,955 --> 00:16:43,196
is going to increase
intellectual capacity.

180
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:44,490
It's just not possible.

181
00:16:44,492 --> 00:16:46,025
Which brings us back to "miracle".

182
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:49,817
Assuming that there was a traumatic
injury, likely a concussion,

183
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:52,064
the most common symptoms
would be memory loss,

184
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,365
change in personality...

185
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:54,400
So...

186
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,035
What if this is the real Marcy?

187
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:57,903
Seriously?

188
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:59,538
Up until the age of 18,

189
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,640
Marcy lived in an institution,

190
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:03,791
one with a reputation
for neglect and abuse,

191
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:05,507
right up until the time
it was shut down.

192
00:17:05,532 --> 00:17:07,059
She doesn't talk about that.

193
00:17:07,948 --> 00:17:10,849
Maybe the "Marcy" we knew
was her way of coping there,

194
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:14,152
her way of making people look after her,

195
00:17:14,154 --> 00:17:15,520
and she just continued that behavior

196
00:17:15,522 --> 00:17:17,500
after her release,
and when she hit her head...

197
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:19,891
She just forgot
who she was pretending to be?

198
00:17:19,893 --> 00:17:20,892
That's crazy.

199
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:22,328
It's infinitely more possible

200
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,288
than her I.Q. doubling overnight.

201
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,531
I've been her caseworker
since her release.

202
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:27,865
That was over a year ago!

203
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:29,967
My case in point.

204
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:33,737
You got her a subsidized
apartment, a job at the library.

205
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:36,107
You see her four or five times a week...

206
00:17:36,109 --> 00:17:37,641
You're saying she played me?

207
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:39,944
The most innocent soul I've ever met.

208
00:17:39,946 --> 00:17:41,261
Played the system.

209
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:42,480
Fooled me, too.

210
00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:47,119
Is something wrong?

211
00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:51,923
"You're... a...

212
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:53,658
...big...

213
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,918
girl...

214
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:59,430
now,"

215
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:03,301
said... Mary...

216
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:08,306
T...

217
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:10,475
Tee... Teacher.

218
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:14,579
Do you remember that?

219
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:18,616
It was just a few months ago.

220
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:22,487
I don't understand.

221
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:23,621
Neither do we.

222
00:18:23,623 --> 00:18:24,622
I'd like to find out

223
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:27,174
what else you don't remember.

224
00:18:28,161 --> 00:18:29,193
It's okay...

225
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,478
I'm here.

226
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,229
Let's start with yesterday.

227
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:34,232
Where were you?

228
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:35,432
At the library.

229
00:18:36,696 --> 00:18:37,687
Good.

230
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:39,003
What did you do at the library?

231
00:18:39,005 --> 00:18:40,237
I'm a librarian.

232
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:42,219
So I was...

233
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,502
So you were checking books in and out,

234
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,611
helping folks find
what they were looking for?

235
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:48,705
Yes.

236
00:18:49,582 --> 00:18:51,191
And can you name one of those people?

237
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,017
David.

238
00:18:53,271 --> 00:18:55,855
Uh, to do research. He's a reporter.

239
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,480
Marcy, stop.

240
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,057
What's wrong?

241
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:05,595
You being a librarian,

242
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,065
me going there to do research
for a newspaper I work for...

243
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:11,167
Those are all part of a profile page

244
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:12,702
that we made up.

245
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:14,760
That's my profile.

246
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,639
We created it as an exercise...

247
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,710
so I could teach you about social media

248
00:19:20,212 --> 00:19:21,777
and other things about the world.

249
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:25,048
Remember?

250
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:27,749
You're not a librarian.

251
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,451
You work there as a cleaning lady.

252
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:31,753
I'm not a reporter.

253
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,819
I'm your social worker.

254
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,095
So... so what...

255
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,462
you're saying is... that...

256
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:42,463
We're just trying to understand.

257
00:19:45,402 --> 00:19:46,702
Marcy?

258
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:48,103
Marce?

259
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:51,506
- Marcy?
- Marcy!

260
00:20:07,187 --> 00:20:08,787
You didn't answer your cell.

261
00:20:10,757 --> 00:20:12,590
What did they say?

262
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:14,011
I have a concussion.

263
00:20:14,695 --> 00:20:15,826
Oh, no.

264
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,865
Will you be able to play
in the game next week?

265
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:20,538
The doctor said that...

266
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,934
if I hadn't walked away from the fight,

267
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:24,135
I might have died.

268
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:26,410
Does it hurt now?

269
00:20:26,966 --> 00:20:28,465
A little.

270
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,679
Are your folks home?

271
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:34,348
No. Why?

272
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:39,353
Oh, I don't think that we should, Rene,

273
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:40,353
'cause my concussion.

274
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:41,687
Let me make you feel better.

275
00:20:45,807 --> 00:20:47,727
Please stop.

276
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:49,052
I just don't think that we should.

277
00:20:49,507 --> 00:20:50,796
Are you breaking up with me?

278
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:51,812
No!

279
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:54,268
If anything...

280
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:56,397
I want to be closer to you.

281
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,505
There are things I don't remember.

282
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:00,539
Things about me?

283
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,675
It's more things about myself.

284
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:03,976
The doctor said

285
00:21:03,978 --> 00:21:05,462
that a concussion as bad as this

286
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:06,511
can cause changes in personality

287
00:21:06,513 --> 00:21:08,180
and memory loss,

288
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:09,681
that the only treatment is time.

289
00:21:09,683 --> 00:21:10,816
That, in time, I'll be the person

290
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:11,884
I was before the concussion.

291
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,781
I need you to help me
remember who that person is.

292
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:20,325
Y-You want me to help you find yourself?

293
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:22,327
Trev...

294
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:24,596
That is so beautiful.

295
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,205
Take it you're not "Leticia".

296
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:36,175
Wrong file.

297
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:39,243
Go ahead, have a seat.

298
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:44,380
Sit.

299
00:21:46,635 --> 00:21:48,111
You look like shit, Philip.

300
00:21:48,113 --> 00:21:49,912
When was the last time you hit?

301
00:21:49,914 --> 00:21:51,614
- I don't use drugs.
- Come on, man.

302
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:52,582
You don't have to pretend with me.

303
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:55,085
I know all about addiction, trust me.

304
00:21:55,087 --> 00:21:57,921
Mine's just legal.

305
00:21:58,244 --> 00:21:59,913
Have they talked to you at all about

306
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:02,125
the methadone program
they got going on, or...?

307
00:22:02,127 --> 00:22:03,126
What is it?

308
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:04,127
Methadone.

309
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:05,228
Your addiction.

310
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,065
Is it gambling?

311
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:12,845
Cigarettes.

312
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,538
Look, I'm just trying
to be simpatico here.

313
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,106
Don't be a dick.

314
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:18,874
I apologize.

315
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:21,344
We're gonna plea.

316
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:22,578
You're gonna end up doing some time.

317
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,779
There's no way around that.

318
00:22:23,781 --> 00:22:25,914
They got you two ways, all right?

319
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:26,949
But, in the meantime...

320
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:28,150
Are you bound by
attorney-client privilege?

321
00:22:29,654 --> 00:22:32,320
Can you guarantee your confidence

322
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:35,090
if I tell you information
that can help us both?

323
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,126
Absolutely. What?

324
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:44,832
I'm so sorry.

325
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:51,217
Come on, you love...

326
00:22:51,908 --> 00:22:53,941
You love making up after we fight.

327
00:22:53,943 --> 00:22:56,211
That wasn't a fight. You struck me.

328
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:57,812
If I hadn't demanded you leave,

329
00:22:57,814 --> 00:22:59,047
you would've struck me again.

330
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,282
From now on,

331
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:03,117
you'll be allowed to
see your son once a day

332
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,886
for one hour, time to be arranged.

333
00:23:04,888 --> 00:23:06,888
I see him when I wanna see him, Carly.

334
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:08,355
Also,

335
00:23:08,357 --> 00:23:10,457
you'll provide proper financial support.

336
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:12,481
Okay. Okay, okay.

337
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:13,673
I get it.

338
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:16,164
Let me make it up to you.

339
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,737
What do you want me to do?

340
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,851
Change Jeffrey's diaper.

341
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:35,517
Hey! Phil!

342
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:37,984
Hey.

343
00:23:37,986 --> 00:23:40,687
You got out quick. What'd they tell you?

344
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:43,120
They didn't say anything.
They just let me go.

345
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,000
Come here, come here.
Come here for a sec.

346
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:52,573
How did you know?

347
00:23:53,101 --> 00:23:55,368
Come on, man. Three horses?

348
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,902
Three races, three different cities...

349
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:58,804
all 20 to 1, or better?

350
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,072
Man, the bets were so stupid,

351
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:01,716
I had to go to three different bookies.

352
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:02,816
I wouldn't have even done it

353
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:04,569
if you hadn't have fronted me
the cash advance.

354
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:07,079
It's all here, by the way,
with interest.

355
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:08,647
Credit card's in there.

356
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,783
Go ahead. Take it.

357
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,530
Come on, come on.

358
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:16,933
You gotta tell me.

359
00:24:19,227 --> 00:24:20,926
Do I still have
attorney-client privilege?

360
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:22,762
Yeah, sure, whatever. Yep. Yep.

361
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,264
I'm from the future.

362
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:29,267
Okay, I get it, you can't tell me.

363
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,235
But, Phil...

364
00:24:31,238 --> 00:24:32,704
you're gonna need me.

365
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:34,773
The cops are gonna be all over you.

366
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:36,708
We gotta look after each other here.

367
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,709
All right?

368
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,244
Oh, speaking of which...

369
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:40,979
There's a little something extra
in there for you,

370
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,342
from the lock-up.

371
00:24:43,117 --> 00:24:44,415
Just a little taste,

372
00:24:44,417 --> 00:24:45,950
so you don't get sick.

373
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:09,873
David?

374
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,876
There she is.

375
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,153
What happened?

376
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:20,568
Dr. Lee says you had a seizure.

377
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,287
It's the diminished capacity.

378
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:25,789
There's too much pre-existing damage.

379
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,826
- What?
- How did I... get here?

380
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,827
We had to take you to the hospital.

381
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,128
You've been out of it the whole day,

382
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:34,030
and as soon as you're feeling up to it,

383
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,031
they wanna run a few tests,
see what's going on...

384
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,032
No, please.

385
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,434
Well, it's not up to me, kiddo.

386
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,101
I can't be in the hospital.

387
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:40,136
Marcy.

388
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:42,270
Listen to me.

389
00:25:42,684 --> 00:25:44,674
I have important work to do.

390
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:45,875
At the library?

391
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,944
No, not at the library.

392
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,147
This is all happening for a reason.

393
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,950
Okay.

394
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:57,220
How about I go get the doctor
and we can talk about this?

395
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,957
Thank you.

396
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:02,325
Okay.

397
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,739
- Forbes.
- Hey.

398
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,307
Jonas Walker hasn't
left his house in a week.

399
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:54,343
Starting to think we're wasting
our time on that one.

400
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,812
Our chatroom, on the other hand,

401
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:59,948
has been filling up all day
with the same weird messages.

402
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,783
I.P.s all over town.

403
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:02,951
You think it's something?

404
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:05,820
Gotta admit, it's making me curious.

405
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:07,289
The one who set up the chatroom
was arrested

406
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,091
and released on a technicality.

407
00:27:09,093 --> 00:27:11,793
Might save time if you contact
the arresting officer.

408
00:27:11,795 --> 00:27:13,728
Name's Gower.

409
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,964
Okay. Bright and early.

410
00:27:29,984 --> 00:27:31,412
Marcy, what're you doing here?

411
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:33,180
I was just at your apartment!
I've been worried sick!

412
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:35,544
I didn't know where else to go.

413
00:27:36,152 --> 00:27:38,085
What is going on?

414
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:40,154
Tell me.

415
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:41,688
I can't.

416
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:45,262
A mistake's been made and I'm
not sure how to correct it.

417
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:47,626
I don't even know if it can be.

418
00:27:48,881 --> 00:27:50,030
Just...

419
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:51,965
know that I'm playing a small part

420
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:53,299
in something that's important.

421
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:55,068
Well, what does that even mean?

422
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,170
I couldn't explain it if I tried.

423
00:27:57,172 --> 00:27:58,514
Please...

424
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,174
just trust me anyway.

425
00:28:33,523 --> 00:28:35,474
Morning. Sorry to bother you so early.

426
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:36,775
I'm Special Agent Grant MacLaren

427
00:28:36,777 --> 00:28:37,976
with the FBI.

428
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:40,045
FBI? Really?

429
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,547
Really.

430
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:43,848
A message was sent
from this I.P. address...

431
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,218
that just means one of
the computers in your house...

432
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,486
kinda raised a flag in our system.

433
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,289
Please tell me
this is not about Internet porn.

434
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:52,257
No. Not porn.

435
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:55,060
At least, I-I don't think so.
No, this is more

436
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:56,527
of a chatroom conversation.

437
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,263
Ah. My son's always in those rooms.

438
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:01,532
He a gamer, by any chance?

439
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:02,901
Video games?

440
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:04,469
Uh, it's all he ever does.

441
00:29:04,921 --> 00:29:06,169
That,

442
00:29:06,172 --> 00:29:07,594
and the other thing.

443
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:08,982
When do you expect him home?

444
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,041
Said he'd be out late tonight

445
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:12,276
with friends.

446
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:14,212
Is he in any kind of trouble?

447
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:16,347
Nah. I doubt it.

448
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:18,448
You have a good day.

449
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,568
Hey.

450
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:36,033
Why is this body always so tired?

451
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:38,035
"This body"?

452
00:29:38,037 --> 00:29:40,437
Well, maybe 'cause it works nights.

453
00:29:40,439 --> 00:29:42,905
This body just made breakfast.

454
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,141
That's very kind.

455
00:29:44,672 --> 00:29:46,451
And you're naked again.

456
00:29:47,778 --> 00:29:48,777
Okay.

457
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:51,703
How about you get dressed
before joining me?

458
00:29:54,297 --> 00:29:55,430
David?

459
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:00,556
If I could tell you, I would.

460
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:04,027
Hey, as long as you're not an assassin

461
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:06,929
or a Hollywood actress
researching a character.

462
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:09,932
Those... Those are the...

463
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,067
two worst-case scenarios I came up with

464
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,569
while I was laying awake all night.

465
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:30,052
Gower.

466
00:30:30,054 --> 00:30:32,487
Morning. Grant MacLaren, FBI.

467
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:33,655
I'm investigating

468
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,057
a 20-year-old male
you booked yesterday...

469
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:37,025
- ...By the name...
- Philip Pearson, yeah.

470
00:30:37,027 --> 00:30:38,026
That's him.

471
00:30:38,028 --> 00:30:39,094
Well, I guess you heard

472
00:30:39,096 --> 00:30:40,395
he won the lottery yesterday, huh?

473
00:30:40,397 --> 00:30:42,030
You mean you had to drop the charges?

474
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,631
No, I mean that he won
the freaking lottery.

475
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,632
Six numbers outta seven.

476
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,034
92-grand and change.

477
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:47,335
Lucky kid.

478
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:49,070
Not if I catch him with the bag of smack

479
00:30:49,072 --> 00:30:50,137
I'm pretty sure

480
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,573
he's walking around with.

481
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:52,640
Our system red-flagged him
as a potential member

482
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,141
of a terrorist cell.

483
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,043
Now, I've got the rest of the
suspects in the group covered,

484
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:57,345
but if you could watch
this one for me...

485
00:30:57,347 --> 00:30:59,614
Look, Agent MacLaren,
there's no way in hell

486
00:30:59,616 --> 00:31:01,216
this kid's a terrorist.

487
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:03,484
Yeah? What were the odds
he was gonna win the lottery?

488
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:05,953
Okay.

489
00:31:05,955 --> 00:31:07,354
Keep this number
and check in with me later.

490
00:31:07,356 --> 00:31:09,123
Tomorrow, he's all yours.

491
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,997
You're welcome
to stay while I'm at work.

492
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,432
There's nothing in the fridge, so...

493
00:31:18,434 --> 00:31:20,034
I'll be out before you get home.

494
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:22,969
I'd like to come back, though,
tonight, if that's all right.

495
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,504
It'll be late, though.

496
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:26,505
I could come with you.

497
00:31:26,508 --> 00:31:27,662
No.

498
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,544
No, you should stay home tonight.

499
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:34,079
The streets won't be safe.

500
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:38,550
Wh... What?

501
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,019
What's gonna happen?

502
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:45,024
Oh, come on, that's going too far.

503
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:46,025
I shouldn't have said anything.

504
00:31:46,027 --> 00:31:47,493
Well, you can't expect me to just...

505
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:56,735
I'll be back just after midnight.

506
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:00,338
You're Batgirl, aren't you?

507
00:32:03,727 --> 00:32:04,934
Bye.

508
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:09,766
Yes?

509
00:32:10,484 --> 00:32:12,550
Special Agent MacLaren of the FBI.

510
00:32:12,552 --> 00:32:13,551
Sorry to bother you.

511
00:32:14,462 --> 00:32:15,387
"MacLaren"?

512
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:16,772
How can I help you?

513
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:18,256
Well, sometimes,
our computer spits stuff out

514
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:19,590
and we have to follow it up.

515
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:20,758
Do you live here alone?

516
00:32:21,378 --> 00:32:22,326
With my son.

517
00:32:22,328 --> 00:32:23,360
How old is he?

518
00:32:23,362 --> 00:32:24,695
Just over a year.

519
00:32:24,697 --> 00:32:26,797
So, no criminal record?

520
00:32:27,973 --> 00:32:28,966
Sorry.

521
00:32:29,816 --> 00:32:31,690
I probably know the answer to this,

522
00:32:31,692 --> 00:32:34,305
but you don't happen to
have plans for later tonight

523
00:32:34,307 --> 00:32:35,606
downtown?

524
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:37,593
No.

525
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:38,794
No plans.

526
00:32:39,378 --> 00:32:41,178
You don't sound very sure.

527
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:45,749
I was trying to decide
if you were asking me out.

528
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:48,051
Uh, no.

529
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:50,653
Me? I'm... I'm busy tonight.

530
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:54,590
Thanks for your time.

531
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,490
Shit!

532
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,064
Come here.

533
00:34:45,414 --> 00:34:46,465
You're welcome.

534
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:48,867
Get in. Let's go Come on.

535
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,964
I had to pay a kid to dare another kid

536
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:54,688
to get Gower off your ass.

537
00:34:54,713 --> 00:34:56,680
Watching your back's
getting expensive, Philip.

538
00:34:56,682 --> 00:34:58,448
What do you want in return?

539
00:34:58,451 --> 00:34:59,450
Today's bet.

540
00:34:59,452 --> 00:35:00,785
I can't do it.

541
00:35:00,787 --> 00:35:03,054
Come on. Yesterday, you gave me three.
Now I'm only asking you for one.

542
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:04,656
Yesterday was an emergency.

543
00:35:04,658 --> 00:35:06,991
Today's kind of an emergency for me.

544
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:09,916
Then you are a very bad gambler.

545
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:12,996
Yeah, I'm a bad gambler...

546
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:23,740
Maybe you'd like to think about it.

547
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:25,179
Get out.

548
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,717
Pearson! Come here!

549
00:35:52,103 --> 00:35:53,102
Where are you going?

550
00:35:53,104 --> 00:35:54,404
Out.

551
00:35:54,406 --> 00:35:55,938
With that guy?

552
00:36:04,048 --> 00:36:05,647
I don't have time for this.

553
00:36:05,649 --> 00:36:06,982
Well, make time.

554
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:12,382
Okay! Damn it.

555
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:14,123
Last warning.

556
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,990
Okay.

557
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:37,690
Hey!

558
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:38,800
Hey!

559
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,987
Pearson! Stop!

560
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:49,823
Come on! Stop!

561
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:54,450
It's a good thing you stopped, kiddo.

562
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:01,494
If I had to climb that fence,
I was gonna have a heart attack.

563
00:37:05,107 --> 00:37:06,726
You're having one right now.

564
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,075
Oh, shut up.

565
00:37:08,077 --> 00:37:09,843
I just need

566
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:11,812
to catch my breath, that's all.

567
00:37:13,883 --> 00:37:15,849
Ooh!

568
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:18,118
Maybe you're right.

569
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,654
My phone... it's in the car.

570
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,889
- Help me.
- I can't, Mr. Gower.

571
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,091
Then find someone with a phone!

572
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,225
I can't, I'm sorry.

573
00:37:27,228 --> 00:37:29,192
You can. I won't
come after you, I promise.

574
00:37:29,194 --> 00:37:30,747
You're supposed to die this afternoon.

575
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,432
No, you don't know...

576
00:37:32,434 --> 00:37:34,895
I knew the moment
that I heard your name.

577
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,603
I just didn't know that I would be here.

578
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:39,105
Call 911 and go!

579
00:37:39,107 --> 00:37:41,703
Because we considered you as a host.

580
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:45,176
The heart attack
was inevitable within days.

581
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:49,515
No... I'm okay.

582
00:37:53,954 --> 00:37:56,054
I think I'm okay.

583
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:32,356
Hello?

584
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:33,724
David Mailer?

585
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:35,125
Yeah?

586
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:37,852
Special Agent
Grant MacLaren with the FBI.

587
00:38:37,976 --> 00:38:40,677
I came by earlier,
left a card under your door.

588
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:43,653
Oh, sorry, I didn't, uh...

589
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:45,511
I didn't see it.

590
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:46,335
Not a problem.

591
00:38:46,337 --> 00:38:47,904
I'm just following up
on a chatroom message

592
00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:50,240
that was sent from
your I.P. address last night.

593
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:52,313
You mean my computer?

594
00:38:52,315 --> 00:38:54,978
Right. Tell me... do you have
plans to meet anyone tonight

595
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,813
downtown, on the 12th floor

596
00:38:56,815 --> 00:38:59,348
of an abandoned building, about 11:17?

597
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,751
No. Why... Why would I do that?

598
00:39:01,753 --> 00:39:04,219
Well, I guess that means
I won't be seeing you there.

599
00:39:04,221 --> 00:39:06,855
I'm just thinking out loud,
but sometimes,

600
00:39:06,857 --> 00:39:09,348
I let my neighbors
use my Wifi, maybe that's, um...

601
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,761
Well, that's a federal offense,
Mr. Mailer.

602
00:39:13,831 --> 00:39:15,097
Is it?

603
00:39:15,099 --> 00:39:17,565
No. I'm kidding. Have a good evening.

604
00:39:22,873 --> 00:39:24,372
No. I'm not pressing charges.

605
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:26,302
I just want to know where she took it.

606
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:29,311
Well, just check
and keep your mouth shut.

607
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,533
Okay. All right. Thanks.

608
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:53,267
Hello?

609
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,103
I'm... I'm trying to
reach Detective Gower.

610
00:39:56,105 --> 00:39:58,239
I thought this was his...

611
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:01,209
Jesus. I'm sorry to hear that.

612
00:40:01,211 --> 00:40:03,110
No, it's-it's not important.

613
00:40:03,112 --> 00:40:04,878
Thank you.

614
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:33,320
Carly?

615
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:07,974
Carly?

616
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:29,418
Got you.

617
00:42:43,968 --> 00:42:46,041
You're actually all here.

618
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:48,070
We've been waiting for you.

619
00:42:48,072 --> 00:42:49,304
Uh-huh.

620
00:42:49,306 --> 00:42:50,639
Where's the social worker?

621
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:52,407
David isn't one of us.

622
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:54,042
One of...?

623
00:42:54,044 --> 00:42:55,828
We're travelers from
the future, Agent MacLaren.

624
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,173
In our time, many years from now,

625
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,015
humanity's been all but wiped out.

626
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,315
We've come back to change that.

627
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:05,728
There are thousands of travelers
already here taking part.

628
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,355
Huh.

629
00:43:08,482 --> 00:43:10,673
Okay, what do you say we, uh,

630
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:12,093
travel downstairs

631
00:43:12,095 --> 00:43:13,639
and talk about this somewhere else?

632
00:43:13,641 --> 00:43:14,875
It's not safe here.

633
00:43:20,617 --> 00:43:22,764
- 60 seconds.
- Till what?

634
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:24,973
In the future,
we've developed a technology

635
00:43:24,975 --> 00:43:26,395
that allows a traveler to project

636
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:28,809
his or her conscious mind
into a host body

637
00:43:28,811 --> 00:43:31,045
by knowing the precise Time, Elevation,

638
00:43:31,047 --> 00:43:33,514
Latitude, and Longitude of their death.

639
00:43:33,516 --> 00:43:35,661
- "T.E.L.L."
- A Traveler's consciousness

640
00:43:35,663 --> 00:43:38,185
arrives moments before
that historical time of death,

641
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:40,721
overriding the original host's mind,

642
00:43:40,723 --> 00:43:42,188
then resumes his or her life

643
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,057
by using their knowledge
of historical records

644
00:43:44,059 --> 00:43:45,060
and social media.

645
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:46,793
Okay, that's enough bullshit for now...

646
00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:47,794
30 seconds.

647
00:43:47,796 --> 00:43:48,862
Wait.

648
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,831
Who the hell is that?

649
00:43:52,134 --> 00:43:54,231
That's the body of Jonas Walker.

650
00:43:56,437 --> 00:43:58,138
We stopped him from going on
a shooting rampage,

651
00:43:58,507 --> 00:44:00,706
just as you tried and failed to do,

652
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:02,575
between 11:14 and 11:17.

653
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:05,045
- 20 seconds.
- We know the events of tonight because,

654
00:44:05,047 --> 00:44:06,812
for us, they've already happened.

655
00:44:06,814 --> 00:44:09,015
Just as we know that,
during a blackout on this night,

656
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:10,150
at 11:17,

657
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:11,518
in pursuit of Jonas Walker,

658
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,885
Special Agent Grant MacLaren

659
00:44:12,887 --> 00:44:15,154
fell 45 meters
down an open elevator shaft

660
00:44:15,455 --> 00:44:16,420
to his death.

661
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:18,724
Three seconds.

662
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:39,177
Ahh!

663
00:44:51,724 --> 00:44:53,290
I see we all made it.

664
00:44:56,829 --> 00:44:59,063
Let's begin.

665
00:45:00,028 --> 00:45:09,246
