1
00:00:00,153 --> 00:00:01,920
Previously on Travelers...

2
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:05,366
In the future,

3
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:06,434
we've developed a technology...

4
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:08,602
...that allows a traveler

5
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:10,971
to project his or her conscious mind...

6
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:12,206
to a host body.

7
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:13,574
In our time,

8
00:00:13,576 --> 00:00:15,086
humanity has been all but wiped out.

9
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:19,012
We've come back to change that.

10
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:20,013
Thirty seconds.

11
00:00:20,015 --> 00:00:21,014
Till what?

12
00:00:22,318 --> 00:00:24,444
On this night,
Special Agent Grant MacLaren

13
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:25,976
fell 45 meters to his death.

14
00:00:31,926 --> 00:00:33,326
I see we all made it.

15
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,362
Let's begin.

16
00:00:39,057 --> 00:00:41,234
So, any issues I should know about?

17
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:43,235
Well, Intel on my host
was way off the mark,

18
00:00:43,237 --> 00:00:45,337
but I'm handling it.

19
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:47,545
We all knew

20
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,575
assuming the lives of people
from another century

21
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:52,111
wasn't going to be a walk in the park.

22
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:54,179
Actually, you should try
a walk in the park sometime.

23
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:55,180
It's lovely.

24
00:00:55,182 --> 00:00:56,648
Thanks. I'll do that.

25
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,117
All coms are set for voice activation.

26
00:00:59,419 --> 00:01:01,880
- All good?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:01,882 --> 00:01:02,927
Loud and clear.

28
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,255
When did you have a chance
to build coms?

29
00:01:04,257 --> 00:01:05,423
After school.

30
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:06,591
Okay.

31
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:07,592
Ready?

32
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,461
Freeze!

33
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:23,373
The material's safer where it is.

34
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:25,241
Dr. Delaney,
the entire power grid is down

35
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:26,542
and your emergency backups

36
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,244
aren't designed to last
for more than a few hours.

37
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:30,179
Your transport unit is untested.

38
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,015
The road vibration alone
could cause containment failure.

39
00:01:33,017 --> 00:01:34,082
Any distance we manage to take it

40
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:35,117
is better than here.

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,918
Bullshit.

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,487
This isn't about safety.

43
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:39,854
You want a new weapon.

44
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:41,590
We're ready to load up, Major.

45
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:43,091
Copy.

46
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:44,893
Doctor.

47
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:46,895
Watch those cables there.

48
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,131
Agent MacLaren?

49
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,731
Yes.

50
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:51,465
You called in that you were
in pursuit of a suspect.

51
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:52,733
Do you need backup?

52
00:01:52,735 --> 00:01:54,568
Yes. We were forced to take him out.

53
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,137
I... I was.

54
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:57,138
That's the body over there.

55
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,506
There's also a police officer

56
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:00,141
locked out on the roof.

57
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:02,410
Okay. We can take it from here.

58
00:02:04,213 --> 00:02:05,946
I'm Traveler 3185.

59
00:02:06,949 --> 00:02:08,846
This is your containment unit.
You can trust it.

60
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,316
I thought we were meeting en route.

61
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,318
No plan survives contact with the past.
You must be new.

62
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,650
Yes. Six minutes ago.
How's that for timing?

63
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:16,354
Go save the world.

64
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:18,958
Thanks.

65
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,193
No pressure.

66
00:02:57,297 --> 00:02:59,429
The convoy is approaching our location.

67
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:01,131
Copy.

68
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,365
We're getting in position.

69
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:11,988
They're passing us now.

70
00:03:15,513 --> 00:03:16,945
Major, the containment unit.

71
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:19,515
It's failing.

72
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:21,517
What?

73
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:24,987
We're detecting micro-annihilations.

74
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,989
- So she was right.
- I wouldn't say that, sir,

75
00:03:26,991 --> 00:03:28,690
but we won't make it to our facility.

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,594
We're looking at an explosion
in the megaton range.

77
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:33,628
Stop the convoy.

78
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,467
At this point, an antimatter
detonation is inevitable.

79
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,035
I want everyone to turn around

80
00:03:41,037 --> 00:03:42,703
and get as far away from here
as you can.

81
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:44,139
Copy that, Major.

82
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,140
Wilson!

83
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:46,174
Sir.

84
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,476
The road ahead's clear.

85
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,310
I'll be following just behind.

86
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:51,512
We'll take it as far as we can.

87
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,198
Go. I'll catch up.

88
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,716
You're not following him?

89
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,734
What?

90
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:19,572
Nothing.

91
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:21,261
I'm just looking you over.

92
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:26,862
Well...

93
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,113
He looks like his picture.

94
00:04:31,652 --> 00:04:33,318
So how do you feel about older men?

95
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:36,421
I asked myself that this morning.

96
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,274
Agent MacLaren came to see me.

97
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:39,467
What?

98
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,251
He's a lot like you.

99
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,715
So much, I almost thought
I was talking to you.

100
00:04:45,164 --> 00:04:46,564
Well, not as charming, I bet.

101
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:48,705
Oh, he was charming.

102
00:04:49,578 --> 00:04:50,776
It even crossed my mind

103
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:52,570
to warn him not to follow us tonight.

104
00:04:52,572 --> 00:04:54,771
Well, the next available host candidate

105
00:04:54,773 --> 00:04:56,807
was a morbidly obese meat salesman,

106
00:04:56,809 --> 00:04:59,798
so thanks for keeping
that thought to yourself.

107
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:03,446
Containment truck
historically one minute out.

108
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:05,241
Copy. We're in position.

109
00:05:08,152 --> 00:05:09,857
They're trying to get
outside the blast radius.

110
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:11,854
The truck is on its own now.

111
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,457
Okay, guys.

112
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:01,568
Sir, I could use your help up here!

113
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,604
This is Wilson. The road
ahead was supposed to be clear.

114
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:06,538
I'm jamming his radio.

115
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,274
Does anybody copy?

116
00:06:09,277 --> 00:06:11,410
Lady, you do not want to be here!

117
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:19,518
I said, you do not...

118
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,365
Okay, he's out!

119
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:48,578
Transfer complete.

120
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:50,925
Pick it up, guys.

121
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,124
Charge is set.

122
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,545
We're good for roughly 40 hours.

123
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:02,815
Well, that went about as well
as I could have hoped.

124
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,885
There it is.

125
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,020
We've just officially changed history.

126
00:08:09,578 --> 00:08:11,490
We just saved 11,000 people.

127
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,916
Except for the guy
who was driving that truck.

128
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,795
One piece of history
that we couldn't change.

129
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,430
At 0830 tomorrow...

130
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:21,899
today... we'll hand off the antimatter
to the arriving team leader

131
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,567
and our first mission will be complete.

132
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,735
Yeah. Philip and I can handle that.

133
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:25,736
Why?

134
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:28,572
Well, Trevor's got school,

135
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:29,940
and Carly's got a baby,

136
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:31,742
and you've got a wife
you've got to go home to

137
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:32,743
and meet for the first time, so...

138
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,641
Okay. You two, do the hand-off.

139
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:35,672
We'll meet later on.

140
00:08:35,697 --> 00:08:36,796
I'll get you home.

141
00:08:36,821 --> 00:08:37,941
Great work, everybody.

142
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:06,951
Hi.

143
00:09:06,953 --> 00:09:09,353
Did you have anything to do
with the blackout?

144
00:09:10,956 --> 00:09:12,272
No.

145
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:16,826
Then...

146
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:18,028
did you...

147
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,687
have anything to do with the FBI?

148
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:24,567
An agent called.
Said he stopped by earlier.

149
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:29,906
You know, I don't get a lot
of FBI agents calling.

150
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:31,974
Was his name MacLaren?

151
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,264
Yes.

152
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:37,265
Would it help you if I told
you I work with him?

153
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:39,081
Yeah, it would.

154
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,798
It would help a lot.

155
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,563
It would make a lot of sense, actually.

156
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:51,522
And it's all good, this FBI business?

157
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:53,624
Yeah, it's all fine.

158
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,646
Okay.

159
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,256
Well, it's late.

160
00:10:06,282 --> 00:10:07,881
One more question.

161
00:10:10,046 --> 00:10:11,445
Why are you here?

162
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:17,338
Staying in my apartment.

163
00:10:17,852 --> 00:10:18,851
With me.

164
00:10:22,424 --> 00:10:24,123
David, there's going to come a time

165
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,658
where I'll need your help.

166
00:10:27,655 --> 00:10:28,654
My help?

167
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:29,688
Mm-hmm.

168
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:31,831
I mean, honestly,

169
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,883
there's not that many people
I can trust.

170
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:37,325
But if... if it's not okay...

171
00:10:37,327 --> 00:10:38,880
No.

172
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:40,914
It's fine.

173
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:58,044
I wish you could come in.

174
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:00,007
There's a babysitter.

175
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,064
Well, I guess we'll
just have to wait until...

176
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:16,384
Yep. That's you, all right.

177
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:20,568
Couldn't even make it upstairs, huh?

178
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:23,833
Oh...

179
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:26,373
I didn't want to wake you.

180
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,152
Tough night?

181
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,716
Uh...

182
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,507
long night.

183
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:42,188
There you go.

184
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,671
Thanks.

185
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:48,334
Oh, no. Is the milk off?

186
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:50,749
You know, the power was out
almost all night.

187
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,445
I am going to the fabric store
later today.

188
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,281
Do you want me to pick up
that linen for your mother?

189
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:56,027
My mother?

190
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,596
That milk is fine.

191
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,097
This is cow's milk.

192
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,732
What animal were you expecting?

193
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,267
You know, I don't know

194
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,335
if we're going to be
seeing them this weekend,

195
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,836
but I can still pick it up.

196
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,938
Yeah, sure. That's...
That's great, Kathryn.

197
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:10,738
Kathryn?

198
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:14,545
What?

199
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:16,703
You haven't called me by my full name

200
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:17,881
since our first date.

201
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:18,781
Yeah.

202
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,193
What's that about?

203
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,393
You need to take a nap.

204
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:24,795
You're not safe to drive
when you're this tired.

205
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:26,566
I've got to go.

206
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,232
I've got that big meeting today.

207
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:32,135
Good luck.

208
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,960
Thank you.

209
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,408
Have a great day...

210
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:39,409
Kat.

211
00:15:39,411 --> 00:15:40,410
Take a nap!

212
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:42,044
Uh-huh.

213
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:56,358
- Trevor! Get up!
- I'm up! I'm up!

214
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,092
- I'm up! I'm up!
- Up!

215
00:15:58,487 --> 00:15:59,486
I'm up, okay?

216
00:16:01,537 --> 00:16:03,159
Breakfast is on the table.

217
00:16:33,228 --> 00:16:35,228
Hey, it's Marcy.

218
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,996
I'll meet you at the T.E.L.L.

219
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:55,914
Hey, Marcy, don't sneak out on me.

220
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,250
I've been thinking,

221
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,151
and I want you
to come to the hospital with me.

222
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:01,186
No.

223
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:03,188
No?

224
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,039
You can't pretend

225
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:06,663
that you didn't have a seizure
two days ago.

226
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:09,460
I mean, whatever else is going on,

227
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,925
that was real,

228
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,329
and it wasn't a little thing.

229
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,465
I'm not gonna pretend
that it didn't happen.

230
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,966
You need to see a doctor.

231
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,303
I am a doctor.

232
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:21,838
What?

233
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:24,174
You want to know
what a doctor would say?

234
00:17:24,175 --> 00:17:27,477
That I had something
like an absence seizure,

235
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,245
that the electrical signals in my brain

236
00:17:29,247 --> 00:17:30,947
repeated themselves over and over

237
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:31,981
in a three-second pattern.

238
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:33,976
She'll be confused

239
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:36,019
because it's more common
in children than adults,

240
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,220
and then she'll order an MRI,

241
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,997
because it's likely to get worse.

242
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:40,623
Why didn't you just say that?

243
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,785
Because...

244
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,859
there's...

245
00:17:43,861 --> 00:17:45,193
there's just so much more to this...

246
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:47,187
Then give me a hint.

247
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:49,530
Give me something.

248
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,901
I mean, technically,
I'm still your social worker.

249
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,062
I could make you go to the hospital.

250
00:17:53,064 --> 00:17:54,403
Okay, what's the date today?

251
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,077
The 13th?

252
00:17:56,973 --> 00:17:58,339
There will be a small
commuter plane crash

253
00:17:58,341 --> 00:18:00,293
in Oregon around noon,

254
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,310
with four casualties.

255
00:18:02,312 --> 00:18:03,445
If it doesn't happen,

256
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:06,213
I will go to the hospital
with you, okay?

257
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,221
Fair?

258
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:09,050
That's ridiculous.

259
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:10,284
I mean, nobody can predict that.

260
00:18:10,286 --> 00:18:11,619
Well, then you'll get what you want,

261
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,286
and I will go to the doctor with you.

262
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:14,882
Do we have a deal?

263
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:16,089
No.

264
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,908
I also want your cell number.

265
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,460
I don't have one.

266
00:18:19,462 --> 00:18:21,127
You don't have a cell?

267
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:22,853
Fine, yours is a secret.

268
00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:31,202
Here. Take this.

269
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,461
I bought it as a gift
for somebody that I used to...

270
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:34,640
You know, it doesn't matter.

271
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:35,641
Take it.

272
00:18:35,643 --> 00:18:36,642
If it rings, it's me.

273
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:38,377
Please answer it.

274
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,245
Welcome to the 21st.

275
00:20:26,247 --> 00:20:28,448
I'm Traveler 3569.

276
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:38,457
Oh, shit.

277
00:20:54,472 --> 00:20:55,471
What do you think, boss?

278
00:20:55,473 --> 00:20:56,472
Of what?

279
00:20:56,474 --> 00:20:58,608
Our operations base.

280
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,015
Yeah, it's breathtaking.

281
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:01,577
You're sure there hasn't been
a messenger?

282
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:02,745
I think a pre-adolescent kid

283
00:21:02,747 --> 00:21:04,246
might stand out.

284
00:21:04,248 --> 00:21:05,901
I thought this was going to be
a simple hand-off?

285
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:08,618
The Director probably didn't
know about the pills.

286
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,919
What pills?

287
00:21:09,921 --> 00:21:11,386
A fatal dose of Fentanyl.

288
00:21:11,388 --> 00:21:13,821
Probably a failsafe in case he lacked
the courage to pull the trigger.

289
00:21:13,823 --> 00:21:15,554
The Director missed it.

290
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:16,991
Cause of death on historical record

291
00:21:16,993 --> 00:21:18,393
was gunshot to the head.

292
00:21:18,395 --> 00:21:20,362
And there wasn't anyone
from his team there to meet him?

293
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:21,845
No. And we looked around.

294
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:22,842
Well, let's not panic.

295
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:24,466
The Director will be aware
that a traveler didn't make it

296
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:25,701
and assign a new candidate.

297
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:27,435
Yeah, if one comes available in time.

298
00:21:27,437 --> 00:21:29,603
You've memorized all the potential
candidates in the area?

299
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,339
I've memorized everything.

300
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:32,606
Okay. Show off a little.

301
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:34,302
How many since 0830?

302
00:21:36,936 --> 00:21:38,930
Hmm... Today's not a real good day.

303
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,350
There was a construction worker that gets
electrocuted earlier this morning...

304
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:43,917
prime host, actually...

305
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,419
but the accident is impossible
for the incoming traveler to avoid, so...

306
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,588
Report of the construction
worker's death this morning

307
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,950
is already online.

308
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,759
In a couple hours,
there's an elective surgery that goes bad.

309
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:53,960
The point is, it could take time.

310
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:55,462
How much do we have?

311
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:57,301
30 hours, give or take.

312
00:21:57,355 --> 00:21:59,187
We should drive the antimatter
out of town,

313
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:00,845
like the military was trying to do.

314
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:03,340
No. The Director must have
some sort of plan for it.

315
00:22:03,342 --> 00:22:05,246
Probably as a power source.

316
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,585
We need to make it possible
for the other team to find us.

317
00:22:08,082 --> 00:22:10,622
I could throw out something
like an S.O.S. on the deep web,

318
00:22:10,623 --> 00:22:12,390
but that would risk exposure by the FBI.

319
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:13,824
You know all about that.

320
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:15,326
Try your S.O.S.

321
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:17,461
I can run interference
at the Bureau if I have to.

322
00:22:17,463 --> 00:22:18,695
And we could look at a way

323
00:22:18,697 --> 00:22:20,363
to extend the life of the unit

324
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:22,064
with a supplemental power supply.

325
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,566
Buy us some time.

326
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:25,381
Good.

327
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:26,605
I'm going to talk to the traveler

328
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,530
that delivered it to us last night.

329
00:22:28,727 --> 00:22:30,594
You sure that's a good idea?

330
00:22:30,676 --> 00:22:32,275
No.

331
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:38,694
Delaney.

332
00:22:38,783 --> 00:22:41,950
This is Major Gleason. I guess
you've been expecting my call.

333
00:22:41,952 --> 00:22:43,752
Actually, I was hoping
to never to hear from you again.

334
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:44,920
How's the circle jerk going?

335
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:46,555
We never had the material, did we?

336
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:47,956
What are you talking about?

337
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,358
You're the one who drove away
with it last night.

338
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,442
Yeah, well, I thought so, too.

339
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:52,760
Why aren't you off on an island
somewhere exploding bombs?

340
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,161
Well, there was an explosion,

341
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,530
just not the one we were expecting.

342
00:22:55,532 --> 00:22:56,997
Oh, God...

343
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:58,032
When?

344
00:22:58,034 --> 00:22:59,367
On our way to our base.

345
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:01,112
How many casualties?

346
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,470
The blast was substantial enough

347
00:23:02,472 --> 00:23:03,771
to put my driver into a coma,

348
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,039
but we both know

349
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:05,906
it should have been
in the megaton range.

350
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:07,274
This didn't even make the news.

351
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:08,576
I'm not sure
what you're accusing me of...

352
00:23:08,578 --> 00:23:10,510
That it never existed,
or somehow, you hung on to it.

353
00:23:10,512 --> 00:23:11,845
Either way,

354
00:23:11,847 --> 00:23:13,547
we are going to have a conversation.

355
00:23:15,684 --> 00:23:16,683
See you later.

356
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:18,195
Bye, sweetie.

357
00:23:19,113 --> 00:23:20,420
See you guys soon.

358
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:21,421
Hey.

359
00:23:21,423 --> 00:23:23,289
Protocol 6, Agent MacLaren.

360
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:24,791
Can't officer Boyd
and Special Agent MacLaren

361
00:23:24,793 --> 00:23:25,792
have a conversation?

362
00:23:25,794 --> 00:23:26,992
Okay, well, first of all,

363
00:23:26,994 --> 00:23:28,742
don't refer to yourself
in the third person.

364
00:23:29,397 --> 00:23:30,763
Is this FBI business?

365
00:23:30,765 --> 00:23:32,297
In the sense that they wouldn't want

366
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,635
an antimatter explosion
in the middle of town.

367
00:23:35,356 --> 00:23:36,362
Are you serious?

368
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:38,838
Have you been sent a messenger?

369
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,439
Are you authorized
by the Director to talk to me?

370
00:23:40,441 --> 00:23:42,040
Then step away.

371
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:44,355
Look, the arriving traveler
we were meeting was D.O.A.

372
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:46,745
In the absence
of a clear course of action,

373
00:23:46,747 --> 00:23:48,613
you await instruction from the Director

374
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:50,081
via messenger or traveler.

375
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,048
What else do you want me to tell you?

376
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,216
How about the location

377
00:23:52,218 --> 00:23:53,923
of the team that we were
supposed to hand off to?

378
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:55,647
I don't know,

379
00:23:55,756 --> 00:23:57,510
and I'm not supposed to know.

380
00:23:57,535 --> 00:23:58,990
Look, you're new, I get it,

381
00:23:58,992 --> 00:24:00,091
I really do,

382
00:24:00,093 --> 00:24:01,917
and you got a bitch
of a first assignment,

383
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:05,629
but I've been here a year,
and shit happens, okay?

384
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:08,365
There's a reason we're so
compartmentalized, MacLaren.

385
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:10,418
There's teams of us
all over the world on missions,

386
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,902
- and that's why...
- That's why there's a protocol six.

387
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:13,069
Yeah, I get the rules,

388
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:14,705
but help me out here.

389
00:24:14,707 --> 00:24:16,573
Should we drive it
to an unpopulated area?

390
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:19,675
Or leave it where it is
and risk wiping out a city?

391
00:24:19,677 --> 00:24:21,611
It's a tough call.

392
00:24:21,613 --> 00:24:23,345
Get it right, please.

393
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:30,453
Aviation authorities agree

394
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:32,688
that if it were not
for the skill of the pilot,

395
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,756
this tragedy could have been much worse.

396
00:24:34,758 --> 00:24:35,891
With just four dead,

397
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:37,605
local authorities are grateful

398
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:40,028
the pilot managed to bring
the commuter plane down

399
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,496
in a remote area.

400
00:24:41,498 --> 00:24:43,998
Names of the dead
have not yet been released

401
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,868
pending notification of the families...

402
00:24:58,681 --> 00:24:59,889
You all right?

403
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:01,235
You're sweating.

404
00:25:01,295 --> 00:25:02,616
I'd like it if there was
no bomb in my house,

405
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:04,145
but otherwise...

406
00:25:04,526 --> 00:25:05,525
Philip.

407
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:08,822
I think we are ready to do this.

408
00:25:11,893 --> 00:25:12,892
You got a cell phone?

409
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:14,527
Yeah.

410
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:16,132
Who could be calling you?

411
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,765
It is my social worker.

412
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:22,160
Yes?

413
00:25:22,418 --> 00:25:24,136
How could you have possibly...

414
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:25,671
possibly known that was going to happen

415
00:25:25,673 --> 00:25:27,706
unless you had something to do
with it happening?

416
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:29,249
I can't tell you that.

417
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:31,009
Marcy, this is crazy.

418
00:25:31,757 --> 00:25:33,471
We made a deal that if it happened,

419
00:25:33,473 --> 00:25:35,296
I wouldn't have to go
to the hospital with you today.

420
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:37,449
Yes, but... but I didn't expect this.

421
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:38,517
Yeah. Well, it happened.

422
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,711
You asked for a hint, I gave you one.

423
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:42,720
Look, I really need to go.

424
00:25:42,722 --> 00:25:44,383
No. Just one more question.

425
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:47,057
This FBI business?

426
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,306
Is it dangerous?

427
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:51,963
Well, that depends on...

428
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:55,466
Marcy, what's happening?

429
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,469
What happened?

430
00:25:58,471 --> 00:25:59,769
His hands just started shaking.

431
00:25:59,771 --> 00:26:01,478
I think he shorted out the circuit.

432
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:04,627
He's in cardiac arrest.

433
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:05,842
- Marcy...
- Go grab my bag.

434
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:09,646
Marcy?

435
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:14,217
Marcy?

436
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:16,085
Come on, Philip.

437
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:17,887
Philip, stay with us.

438
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:19,121
Marcy?

439
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:20,623
Come on.

440
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:21,957
Marcy?

441
00:26:25,062 --> 00:26:26,729
Come on...

442
00:26:28,652 --> 00:26:30,018
Come on.

443
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:42,644
He's back.

444
00:26:46,335 --> 00:26:47,334
Speak up, Trevor.

445
00:26:50,853 --> 00:26:52,473
We didn't add time.

446
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,223
We lost it, and there's not much left.

447
00:27:07,436 --> 00:27:09,035
I don't know what happened.

448
00:27:09,037 --> 00:27:11,637
It was like a tremor. My hand
just jumped from the connectors.

449
00:27:11,639 --> 00:27:13,739
Shorting out
our supplemental power supply

450
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:15,664
and draining the unit's capacitor.

451
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:17,431
I am so sorry, guys.

452
00:27:17,806 --> 00:27:18,805
Could you start over?

453
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:21,391
Not in the few hours we have.

454
00:27:23,078 --> 00:27:24,341
What did you get out of Boyd?

455
00:27:24,681 --> 00:27:27,213
Only that I was in gross
violation of protocol six

456
00:27:27,215 --> 00:27:28,585
and we should solve our own problems.

457
00:27:28,587 --> 00:27:30,045
I think the solution now

458
00:27:30,047 --> 00:27:32,184
is to get that thing at a safe distance.

459
00:27:32,186 --> 00:27:34,326
Carly, if that's what
the Director wanted us to do,

460
00:27:34,328 --> 00:27:35,520
wouldn't he have sent
a messenger by now,

461
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:36,455
telling us to do it?

462
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:37,718
Which means there's another solution

463
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,948
we haven't thought of.

464
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:41,193
Yeah. One that we will think of
in the next five hours.

465
00:27:41,195 --> 00:27:42,393
If we're down to hours,

466
00:27:42,395 --> 00:27:43,962
there's no safe place for the antimatter

467
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:45,363
other than far away.

468
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:49,968
Yes, there is.

469
00:27:51,304 --> 00:27:52,503
And it's obvious.

470
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:54,765
Where it was created.

471
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:56,934
Delaney's lab?

472
00:27:57,723 --> 00:27:59,593
- That's insane.
- Is it?

473
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,478
I mean, the whole facility

474
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,414
was designed to store antimatter
for an unlimited amount of time.

475
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:06,468
And it's a half hour away in traffic.

476
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,371
I'm sure the team

477
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:09,328
we were supposed to hand this off to

478
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:10,786
must have had other plans.

479
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:11,855
Well, no plan survives

480
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,752
contact with the past.

481
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:17,122
Can you find us a map
of the Van Huizen compound

482
00:28:17,147 --> 00:28:18,135
on this antique?

483
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:21,517
Okay, one, this equipment
is currently state of the art,

484
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:23,505
and two,

485
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,330
wouldn't you rather I just hack
into their main computer system?

486
00:28:25,536 --> 00:28:27,336
Oh.

487
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,861
Yes, please.

488
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:30,865
Okay, I don't want

489
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,446
to shoot a hole in our only idea
here, but...

490
00:28:32,471 --> 00:28:33,461
How do we do this

491
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:34,513
without Delaney knowing we did it?

492
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,570
I'm already
in violation of protocol six today,

493
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:37,631
maybe I should just tell her.

494
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,814
Oh, no.

495
00:28:38,816 --> 00:28:39,815
What is it?

496
00:28:39,817 --> 00:28:41,082
The school called my mom.

497
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:42,517
I missed a science test yesterday.

498
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:44,286
I'm in!

499
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:50,682
I could shut down the security system.

500
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,266
I could probably
shut down their power...

501
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:54,791
But what might be most useful

502
00:28:54,997 --> 00:28:56,197
is a flood

503
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,030
in the high-pressure
water coolant supply

504
00:28:58,032 --> 00:28:59,133
of building 26.

505
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,887
What do you think?

506
00:29:15,316 --> 00:29:16,749
What the hell?

507
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Okay. See you, Jason.

508
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:44,533
Your friend is determined.

509
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:45,923
Yeah.

510
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,033
There.

511
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,968
He gave up.

512
00:29:52,187 --> 00:29:54,218
What exactly does a librarian need

513
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,087
with a social worker?

514
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:00,147
My host's identity was fiction.

515
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:01,958
The product of...

516
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,226
a character-building exercise

517
00:30:03,228 --> 00:30:04,519
in social media,

518
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,930
in which her case

519
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,098
was our primary source of information.

520
00:30:09,014 --> 00:30:11,549
In reality, Marcy...

521
00:30:12,498 --> 00:30:14,104
is a mentally-challenged woman

522
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,611
living in the care of the state.

523
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,306
How is that not a giant problem?

524
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,516
Long term, it's most certainly fatal.

525
00:30:21,518 --> 00:30:24,333
I mean, not today or the next day.

526
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,423
I plan on telling MacLaren

527
00:30:26,448 --> 00:30:28,317
once I've properly diagnosed myself

528
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,653
I just need somebody to know
in case I have another seizure.

529
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,356
We all our have burdens.

530
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:39,508
Yours is no easier.

531
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:46,648
I'm a doctor, I know the symptoms.

532
00:30:49,638 --> 00:30:50,904
I'm dealing with it.

533
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:52,672
Well, I want you to dose before we go.

534
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:56,110
To keep your hands from shaking.

535
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,979
Today is not the day you want to quit.

536
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:15,987
You know, I'm not crazy

537
00:31:16,012 --> 00:31:18,281
about the idea of getting
in bed with a mass murderer.

538
00:31:18,283 --> 00:31:19,717
Who? Delaney?

539
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,809
You're forgetting we changed history.

540
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:21,810
It never happened.

541
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:24,378
She still created the most destructive
weapon in history.

542
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,081
If the military hadn't
taken it farther away...

543
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:28,315
That's their horse shit story.

544
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:29,228
Delaney was a scapegoat.

545
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:31,336
It was their own
containment unit that failed.

546
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:33,406
History just bought into
their version of the story.

547
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:36,595
I've seen her in those old history docs.

548
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:38,228
The woman's got all the charm

549
00:31:38,253 --> 00:31:39,619
of a foaming yeast vat.

550
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:48,267
Turn left up here.

551
00:31:57,878 --> 00:31:59,778
Hey. How's your day going so far?

552
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,415
We've got something here
about flooding in building 26.

553
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:05,184
I.D.s, please?

554
00:32:05,186 --> 00:32:07,086
Sure.

555
00:32:17,597 --> 00:32:19,563
Fourteen gallons of water per minute.

556
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,733
Tick tock.

557
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:26,724
Go ahead.

558
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:38,348
Afternoon, sir, I'm with FTRA.

559
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:39,639
Go ahead.

560
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:41,317
Okay then.

561
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,425
Okay, guys, I've hacked into
the security systems.

562
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:52,325
No workers where we want to be.

563
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:54,675
All right. Keep your eyes
and your coms open.

564
00:33:14,805 --> 00:33:15,804
Come on.

565
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:31,198
Looks like the interface is up top.

566
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,900
You stay right where you are.

567
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:44,592
Shit.

568
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:52,856
South door. Go.

569
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:05,822
I already shut off the relief valve

570
00:34:05,824 --> 00:34:07,491
that had been opened remotely,

571
00:34:07,493 --> 00:34:09,359
so you don't need to bother
going through the motions.

572
00:34:12,097 --> 00:34:13,864
So, Major Dickless

573
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:15,599
didn't have the balls
to do this himself?

574
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,400
If you mean Major Gleason,

575
00:34:17,402 --> 00:34:19,635
who took your antimatter last night, no.

576
00:34:19,637 --> 00:34:22,170
In fact, we're the ones
who took it from him.

577
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:23,405
The material is in that black bag

578
00:34:23,407 --> 00:34:24,406
on my associate's shoulder.

579
00:34:24,408 --> 00:34:26,609
In a bag that size?

580
00:34:26,611 --> 00:34:27,843
No.

581
00:34:27,845 --> 00:34:29,444
It is pretty heavy.

582
00:34:29,446 --> 00:34:30,445
My other associate

583
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:32,347
has a .9mm aimed at your back.

584
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:33,549
Marcy, would you just aim

585
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:34,550
the laser guide of your weapon

586
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:36,217
at me for a second?

587
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:39,487
We stopped a disaster last night,

588
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,722
and to prevent another one,

589
00:34:40,724 --> 00:34:43,141
we need to get this material
back where it belongs.

590
00:34:43,143 --> 00:34:45,226
Who the frig are you people?

591
00:34:45,228 --> 00:34:46,360
My name is MacLaren.

592
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:47,795
I'm with the FBI.

593
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:49,898
My team has been tasked
at the highest level

594
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,365
to prevent the military from building

595
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:53,366
the most powerful weapon
of mass destruction in history.

596
00:34:53,368 --> 00:34:55,135
The teenager is FBI?

597
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:57,638
Just me. They're specialists.

598
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,305
Show me your credentials.

599
00:35:00,618 --> 00:35:01,875
We prevented the deaths

600
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:03,443
of thousands of people last night,

601
00:35:03,445 --> 00:35:04,811
not to mention an arms race...

602
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,346
But our portable containment unit

603
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:08,649
has a limited battery capacity.

604
00:35:08,651 --> 00:35:10,215
Show it to me.

605
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:11,517
Yeah.

606
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:26,631
Is it supposed to be flashing like that?

607
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:27,634
We don't have much time.

608
00:35:27,636 --> 00:35:29,098
We need to transfer it now.

609
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,269
How could you possibly create
a stable magnetic bottle

610
00:35:31,271 --> 00:35:32,671
inside something so small?

611
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:34,673
Somebody's here!

612
00:35:36,242 --> 00:35:37,241
It's one vehicle,

613
00:35:37,243 --> 00:35:38,677
and the driver's alone.

614
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:39,844
Military.

615
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,212
Copy. Take no action.

616
00:35:41,214 --> 00:35:43,017
A vehicle's just pulled up outside.

617
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,536
It's Gleason. I thought he sent
you people to steal my research.

618
00:35:45,564 --> 00:35:46,864
How much time do we have?

619
00:35:46,889 --> 00:35:48,288
It's not like
there's a clock on the thing.

620
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:49,614
Minutes.

621
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:51,521
There won't be a warning,
it'll just go boom.

622
00:35:51,523 --> 00:35:53,724
You need to get rid of him
as quickly as possible.

623
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:54,959
That's all I ever do with him.

624
00:35:55,694 --> 00:35:56,693
Come on.

625
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:11,841
Where's your staff?

626
00:36:11,843 --> 00:36:14,224
We had a small coolant leak.

627
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:16,433
I sent everyone home
while these people clean up.

628
00:36:16,948 --> 00:36:19,340
Can you guys be somewhere else
for a few minutes?

629
00:36:19,917 --> 00:36:21,009
You're fine.

630
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:22,167
Go back to work.

631
00:36:23,954 --> 00:36:25,253
They don't give a shit
what we have to say,

632
00:36:25,255 --> 00:36:26,521
and, frankly, I'm a little afraid

633
00:36:26,523 --> 00:36:27,923
to be alone with you.

634
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:29,257
That's funny, I feel the same way.

635
00:36:29,259 --> 00:36:30,859
Go see for yourself that it's not here

636
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:31,860
so you can leave.

637
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:38,185
We don't have time for this.

638
00:36:39,081 --> 00:36:40,080
Not yet.

639
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:43,848
All right.

640
00:36:43,873 --> 00:36:47,570
So, if I never had it,
and it's not here,

641
00:36:47,595 --> 00:36:48,857
then the only other possibility...

642
00:36:54,355 --> 00:36:55,354
What is that sound?

643
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:02,094
I lied.

644
00:37:05,694 --> 00:37:07,527
It never existed.

645
00:37:08,711 --> 00:37:10,428
Material seemed to be accumulating,

646
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,797
but with each new
anti-particle we created,

647
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:13,398
there were quantum micro-annihilations

648
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,599
that went unrecorded.

649
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:17,204
- We have to take him out.
- I said, wait.

650
00:37:17,206 --> 00:37:18,798
I didn't want to lose our funding

651
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,079
and thought we were making progress,

652
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:21,642
- but, at best...
- We don't have time for this.

653
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:22,967
...You drove off with a milligram.

654
00:37:23,028 --> 00:37:24,994
I know how hard that must
have been for you to confess,

655
00:37:24,996 --> 00:37:26,195
and on that level,

656
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:27,397
I must admit I enjoyed that a little.

657
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:29,616
But I do believe you were close,

658
00:37:29,618 --> 00:37:32,019
and we want you to continue your work.

659
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:36,038
That means you won't be
rid of me for a while.

660
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,174
Can I at least be rid of you now?

661
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:41,678
Of course.

662
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:53,395
Major Dickless is leaving.

663
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,525
Is the containment unit
powered up to 120 MeV?

664
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:13,817
We left it fully charged

665
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:16,010
in case the transfer
wasn't a hundred percent.

666
00:38:16,012 --> 00:38:17,677
How long is this going to take?

667
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,235
I don't know.

668
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:31,357
Done. It's back.

669
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,626
Huh.

670
00:38:33,628 --> 00:38:35,127
I kind of thought
that would be a bigger deal.

671
00:38:36,697 --> 00:38:37,763
Nope.

672
00:38:38,766 --> 00:38:40,065
Empty.

673
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,971
10.3 grams of antimatter.

674
00:38:41,996 --> 00:38:43,487
Perfectly stable.

675
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,539
How close did we come?

676
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,591
I already told you,
there's no way of knowing.

677
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,109
It was pretty close, though.

678
00:38:57,584 --> 00:39:00,153
Doctor, I can't
emphasize enough how important...

679
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,211
FBI, my ass.

680
00:39:02,556 --> 00:39:04,288
Who are you people?

681
00:39:04,766 --> 00:39:07,124
Blondie over there
can't be much over 20.

682
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:09,259
And the technology beefcake
carried in on his shoulder

683
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,527
doesn't exist.

684
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:12,095
Well, obviously, it does.

685
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:14,264
Look, all you need to know at this point

686
00:39:14,266 --> 00:39:15,566
is that I am with the Bureau,

687
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:17,067
the task force is top secret,

688
00:39:17,069 --> 00:39:18,502
and this won't be
the last you hear from us.

689
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:20,103
Just keep the material safe for now.

690
00:39:20,105 --> 00:39:21,438
For now?

691
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,706
What does that mean?

692
00:39:22,708 --> 00:39:24,140
As in out of the hands of the military

693
00:39:24,142 --> 00:39:26,208
and off the front page of the paper.

694
00:39:26,757 --> 00:39:28,344
Look...

695
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:30,011
if you need to reach me,

696
00:39:30,482 --> 00:39:31,581
or you want our help,

697
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:32,939
there's my number.

698
00:39:33,417 --> 00:39:35,562
But I'll probably be calling you first.

699
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,820
I'll hold my breath.

700
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:38,988
By the way,

701
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,523
we were this close to intervening.

702
00:39:41,525 --> 00:39:42,907
You just saved his life.

703
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:44,191
Who? Gleason?

704
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,761
Oh, great, that makes my day.

705
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:27,268
Did you get my text?

706
00:40:27,669 --> 00:40:29,502
Yeah, sorry.

707
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,470
I got busy.

708
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:34,204
Well, the doctors did say

709
00:40:34,207 --> 00:40:36,151
you'd get back to your old self.

710
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:56,160
I was making some tea. Do you want some?

711
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,465
Please.

712
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:02,121
So...

713
00:41:03,536 --> 00:41:04,937
did you save him?

714
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,690
Hmm?

715
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:09,940
I only ask

716
00:41:09,942 --> 00:41:11,074
because I heard you

717
00:41:11,076 --> 00:41:13,710
administering CPR
to someone named Philip,

718
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:16,113
who apparently had a cardiac arrest

719
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:18,214
before the phone went dead,

720
00:41:18,216 --> 00:41:21,585
and then you didn't answer
for the rest of the day.

721
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:25,955
Yeah, he's... he's fine.

722
00:41:25,957 --> 00:41:27,791
Oh, good.

723
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:29,892
Good.

724
00:41:34,364 --> 00:41:36,331
So, what's on the agenda for tomorrow?

725
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:38,467
Uh...

726
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:40,368
I was thinking about what you said,

727
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,536
and tomorrow, I'm going to go
to the hospital.

728
00:41:45,775 --> 00:41:47,597
Do you want me to take you,

729
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:49,844
or...

730
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:53,182
do you want to rappel
down a rope from a helicopter?

731
00:41:56,196 --> 00:41:58,195
No. I would like you to take me.

732
00:41:58,988 --> 00:42:00,587
Please.

733
00:42:05,995 --> 00:42:08,361
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

734
00:42:09,832 --> 00:42:11,632
Okay.

735
00:42:11,634 --> 00:42:13,533
Oh, thank you.

736
00:42:13,535 --> 00:42:14,800
I'll see you tomorrow.

737
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:17,670
Okay.

738
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,709
Okay.

739
00:42:36,757 --> 00:42:38,318
I'm home!

740
00:42:38,525 --> 00:42:39,791
What?

741
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:41,726
My husband? Actually
home for the evening?

742
00:42:41,728 --> 00:42:43,928
No... Hi.

743
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:45,596
Hi.

744
00:42:47,467 --> 00:42:48,432
Hi.

745
00:42:48,434 --> 00:42:50,467
What are you... This is a nice surprise.

746
00:42:54,295 --> 00:42:55,528
You get that,

747
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:57,753
I'll go pour us a glass of wine.

748
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,579
Hello?

749
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,381
Traveler 3468.

750
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:08,017
Mission outcome acceptable
in light of extenuating factors.

751
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:11,721
Further breach of protocols
may result in punitive action.

752
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:13,823
End of message.

753
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,161
Who are you?

754
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,697
I'm the guy you're going
to sell those cookies to,

755
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:21,760
I think.

756
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,599
Sweetheart, I bought two boxes from you

757
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:25,734
half an hour ago.

758
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,655
You've already done
this side of the street.

759
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,406
Okay, bye.

760
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,814
Both of which

761
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,414
you're going to take
to the office with you tomorrow.

762
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,850
If they stay in this house,
I'll eat them all.

763
00:43:42,852 --> 00:43:44,192
If you insist...

764
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:47,696
So, how was your day?

765
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:50,281
You know what?

766
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,359
My day was boring.

767
00:43:52,361 --> 00:43:53,694
I'd rather hear about yours.

768
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:57,496
Tell me everything.
