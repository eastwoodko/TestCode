1
00:00:00,042 --> 00:00:01,808
Previously on Travelers...

2
00:00:02,085 --> 00:00:03,451
We've been abducted.

3
00:00:03,453 --> 00:00:05,587
Why don't you show yourself?

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,490
- Wilson!
- Sir.

5
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:10,325
The road ahead's clear.

6
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,526
I'll be following just behind.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,472
Sir, I could use your help up here.

8
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:19,208
The blast was substantial enough

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,452
to put my driver into a coma,

10
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:21,944
but we both know it should have
been in the megaton range.

11
00:00:21,946 --> 00:00:23,280
I'm not sure what you're accusing me of.

12
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:24,414
That it never existed

13
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:25,782
or somehow you hung on to it.

14
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:28,785
Either way, we are going
to have a conversation.

15
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:40,362
Amen!

16
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:43,766
Moses went to the mountain
for 40 days and nights.

17
00:00:43,768 --> 00:00:47,403
Jesus wandered into the desert
for 40 days,

18
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:51,540
and so too have we journeyed
across this land,

19
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:54,142
back to the place
where I first had the vision

20
00:00:54,144 --> 00:00:55,344
of our coming rapture.

21
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,978
- Hallelujah!
- Praise be.

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,213
It was here at the shores of this river

23
00:00:58,215 --> 00:01:01,783
that you were first baptized
into my flock.

24
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:03,151
Amen.

25
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:04,774
My friends...

26
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:08,456
it is time.

27
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,558
Hallelujah.

28
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,396
The Lord awaits us!

29
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,652
Aah!

30
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:03,610
Did we all make it?

31
00:02:03,612 --> 00:02:05,712
Good question.

32
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:08,911
Anybody here feeling out of place?

33
00:02:10,752 --> 00:02:12,218
Feeling not too bad.

34
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:14,014
Gang's all here.

35
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,357
Well, hallelujah.
That's got to be a record.

36
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:40,779
Nurse said you woke up at 0300

37
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:43,382
and tried to pull out
your ventilator tube.

38
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:46,084
They called me in to reprimand you.

39
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:48,053
Yes, sir.

40
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,989
Sorry, I was a little out of it.

41
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:53,625
Anyone told you you've been unconscious

42
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:54,993
for a number of weeks?

43
00:02:54,995 --> 00:02:56,795
Yeah, it's hard to believe.

44
00:02:57,255 --> 00:02:59,631
It feels like I was in
the driver's seat of that truck

45
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,587
and then...

46
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,801
I was here.

47
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,737
Can you tell me
what happened that night?

48
00:03:08,174 --> 00:03:09,507
To be honest, sir,

49
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,142
you probably saw more of what happened

50
00:03:11,144 --> 00:03:12,385
than I did.

51
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:14,578
How's that?

52
00:03:15,241 --> 00:03:17,949
You were following behind me,
like you said.

53
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,377
I spotted your headlights at one point.

54
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:24,088
I was mostly focused

55
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,058
on keeping the vibrations down
and the road ahead.

56
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:31,328
And then the car came out of nowhere,

57
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,696
and that woman walked out.

58
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:33,664
What woman?

59
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,332
You didn't see her?

60
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:36,600
I radioed you

61
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:37,868
before I stopped the truck.

62
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,889
She was just standing
in the middle of the road.

63
00:03:40,473 --> 00:03:41,772
I told her she didn't want to be there,

64
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:44,274
and then the next thing I remember,

65
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:46,309
I was driving again.

66
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:49,812
Sir, I know it sounds crazy, but...

67
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:50,846
All right.

68
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:53,216
That's enough for now.

69
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:55,651
I'm sure it'll all come
back to you in time.

70
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:59,322
Get some rest.

71
00:03:59,324 --> 00:04:02,492
Sir, I know what was
in the back of my truck.

72
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:05,461
How am I still alive?

73
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:09,198
I'm going to go find out.

74
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:42,898
Hey.

75
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,333
Someone tried to shabby-chic

76
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:48,069
a classic barley twist.

77
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,905
Client wants me to restore it.

78
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:51,573
I brought you the last of the coffee.

79
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:52,573
Oh, I left that for you

80
00:04:52,575 --> 00:04:54,575
for your traveler's mug.

81
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:55,910
My what?

82
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,879
You know, that insulated mug
your dad used to wander

83
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,214
around the house with?

84
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,216
Oh... uh, no.

85
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,752
I've had my caffeine ration for the day.

86
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,354
I was thinking about

87
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:07,688
doing fish on the grill tonight.

88
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,789
Don't count on me for dinner.

89
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,058
Oh.

90
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:12,593
I was hoping,

91
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:14,194
since you've been working
so much these past few weeks...

92
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:16,063
I can't. Not tonight.

93
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,199
All right.

94
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:25,604
So that's a classic barley twist, huh?

95
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:27,040
Mm.

96
00:05:27,042 --> 00:05:29,309
Imagine someone treating it like that...

97
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:31,111
not knowing what they have.

98
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,614
It's impressive what you do.

99
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,816
Why do you think that is, Grant?

100
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:40,887
You take something neglected, and...

101
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:43,322
something that's rare and beautiful,

102
00:05:43,917 --> 00:05:45,517
and make it whole again.

103
00:05:46,828 --> 00:05:49,228
Oh. Thank you.

104
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,734
I told Forbes that I'd be early.

105
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:58,637
Bye, Kat.

106
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:01,331
Bye.

107
00:06:05,012 --> 00:06:06,745
Patricia?

108
00:06:09,117 --> 00:06:10,316
Oh, no, no.

109
00:06:10,318 --> 00:06:12,184
That's not what you said
you were gonna wear.

110
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:13,352
Well, I've changed my mind!

111
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:14,920
No, you know I like you
in that black dress.

112
00:06:14,922 --> 00:06:16,321
All right.

113
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:17,756
Would you mind? Thank you.

114
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:20,092
You know, my Humanities
teacher, Mr. Warchowski,

115
00:06:20,094 --> 00:06:21,627
says that in 20 years,

116
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:23,428
equality between the sexes
won't even be an issue.

117
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,997
Warchowski's the gay one, isn't he?

118
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:25,831
Not an issue.

119
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:28,333
No parties while I'm
gone, okay, superstar?

120
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:29,434
I promise.

121
00:06:29,436 --> 00:06:30,435
I'm serious.

122
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:31,636
I can tell.

123
00:06:31,638 --> 00:06:32,770
You have a good time, Gary.

124
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,305
I'll be in the car.

125
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:35,706
And stop calling me "Gary,"
for Christ's sakes.

126
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,974
I'm your father.

127
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:47,385
You looked lovely in that other
dress, by the way.

128
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,219
Oh, it's just easier, honey.

129
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:51,522
We've got to teach him some time.

130
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,490
Yeah. Thank you.

131
00:06:53,492 --> 00:06:56,527
Okay, so we are gonna be
home by noon tomorrow.

132
00:06:57,463 --> 00:06:59,296
Bye, Mom.

133
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:05,869
Thank you, sweetheart.

134
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:08,452
Bye.

135
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:16,647
All set?

136
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:17,481
Yep.

137
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:18,448
What's wrong?

138
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,883
Is everything all right?

139
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:22,085
Yeah, you know. Parents.

140
00:07:25,657 --> 00:07:26,923
Prevent Helios,

141
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:29,759
and we prevent
the beginning of the Fall.

142
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,728
That was the Director's calculation

143
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,262
that started this whole thing.

144
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:34,731
More than any other,

145
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,365
this is the mission objective

146
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:39,555
that motivated us
to come back to the 21st.

147
00:07:40,205 --> 00:07:43,038
I know you all just went through hell,

148
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,483
and I wish we had answers, but we don't.

149
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:50,346
So let's just focus
on the mission at hand.

150
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:51,714
Marcy?

151
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:54,516
All right. Uh...

152
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,086
Place the business end
against your bicep like so,

153
00:07:57,088 --> 00:07:58,353
and push.

154
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,757
It's important that you receive
the full dosage. Okay?

155
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,258
You'll still smell and taste
the chemical in the air

156
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,526
within the compound, but I promise you,

157
00:08:04,528 --> 00:08:06,128
this will stop your nervous system

158
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,964
from shutting down. Okay?

159
00:08:13,136 --> 00:08:14,469
What?

160
00:08:14,471 --> 00:08:15,837
Nervous about a little pin-prick

161
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,554
after what we've just been through?

162
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:19,140
I just have a thing with needles.

163
00:08:19,142 --> 00:08:21,067
Funny. Me too.

164
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:23,245
Speaking of which...

165
00:08:23,247 --> 00:08:24,979
this isn't gonna interfere with...?

166
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:27,414
No, you're fine. You can go ahead.

167
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:29,784
Abductors set back his rehab.

168
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:30,785
Ah.

169
00:08:31,788 --> 00:08:33,287
One last thing.

170
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:36,958
It was our decision to take
the antimatter back to Delaney.

171
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,292
It's on us

172
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:40,394
that the location for this
mission had to change,

173
00:08:40,396 --> 00:08:43,097
so one way or the other,
we are seeing this through.

174
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,499
To the end, if necessary.

175
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:46,767
We know.

176
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:48,602
And we're good.

177
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:51,078
Yes, you are.

178
00:08:53,976 --> 00:08:55,041
If I may?

179
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:03,616
We, the last unbroken remnants...

180
00:09:03,618 --> 00:09:05,018
...Vow to undo

181
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,853
the errors of our ascendants,

182
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:08,688
to make the Earth whole,

183
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:11,357
the lost unlost,

184
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:13,960
at peril of our own birth.

185
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,266
Okay.

186
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,636
It's time.

187
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,480
Could I take this in my glutes,

188
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:28,775
or does it have to be my arm?

189
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,777
Not a lot of muscle to work with.

190
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,478
Just stick to the instructions, Becky.

191
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,779
You're our best sniper.

192
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,131
Good to go.

193
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,597
Dr. Delaney?

194
00:10:27,292 --> 00:10:28,432
That was fast.

195
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:30,368
I need you to come with us, ma'am.

196
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,635
Come with you?

197
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,170
That I wasn't expecting.

198
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:34,271
Where are we going?

199
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:35,740
I'm afraid I can't say.

200
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,166
No.

201
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:38,461
No?

202
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:40,543
Look it up. It means "no."

203
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:44,915
Ma'am, I'm afraid I'm not authorized

204
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:46,081
to take no for answer.

205
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:47,918
Oh, for God's sake,
I'm just screwing with you.

206
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,092
Let's go.

207
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:52,890
Stay here.

208
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:54,624
The Major doesn't want
anyone to have access

209
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:55,892
without his knowledge.

210
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:56,947
Yes, sir.

211
00:11:06,004 --> 00:11:07,370
Look at all the trees.

212
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:09,939
Can you imagine
ever seeing so many trees?

213
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:11,908
I've seen maybe 100 birds.

214
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,244
Oh! There's another one
of those Canada Geese!

215
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:17,546
Keep your eyes on the road.

216
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:20,232
All my eyes are
looking for is a rest stop.

217
00:11:21,052 --> 00:11:23,552
Oh. We're on a tight schedule.

218
00:11:23,554 --> 00:11:26,155
Yeah, tell my bladder.

219
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:45,807
These are your guys?

220
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:47,175
I thought...

221
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:50,478
Oh, by all means,
complete that sentence.

222
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,779
Who were you expecting?

223
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:52,948
Take me back to my lab, please.

224
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,015
You just got here.

225
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,750
Then I want to talk to my lawyer.

226
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:57,452
Dr. Delaney,
you're a military contractor

227
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:58,920
operating under military law

228
00:11:58,922 --> 00:12:00,822
during a time of contingency operations.

229
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:02,189
I am a scientist,

230
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:03,791
and my contract is with
the Van Huizen Corporation.

231
00:12:03,793 --> 00:12:05,059
Consequently, you fall under

232
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:06,461
the code of military conduct,

233
00:12:06,463 --> 00:12:07,862
and will be held for questioning.

234
00:12:07,864 --> 00:12:09,363
Sergeant?

235
00:12:09,365 --> 00:12:10,865
I'll need to take this for now, ma'am.

236
00:12:10,867 --> 00:12:12,433
Follow me, please.

237
00:12:23,637 --> 00:12:25,346
Don't know why you'd be nervous.

238
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:26,754
You're in your element.

239
00:12:27,516 --> 00:12:29,716
I'm just thinking about Jeffrey,

240
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:32,427
about not being able to protect him.

241
00:12:33,222 --> 00:12:35,021
I never expected to get so attached.

242
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:36,022
You can't think like that.

243
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:37,958
You got to stay in the present.

244
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,693
Irony intended.

245
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:41,338
What about your wife?

246
00:12:42,297 --> 00:12:43,396
Does it bother you

247
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:44,364
that you may never see her again?

248
00:12:44,366 --> 00:12:46,332
That's not really the present, is it?

249
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:52,905
That's not really an answer.

250
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,832
Mrs. Bloom? Are you ready?

251
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:17,930
Now, legally, we need to present
this material before we proceed.

252
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:22,759
I didn't walk in here by mistake.

253
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:26,071
I'll be right back with your medicine.

254
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:30,275
Could I have some chocolate, please?

255
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,544
I hear the liquid is bitter.

256
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,545
Of course.

257
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,423
Oh...

258
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:24,961
Uh...

259
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,975
Is everything okay?

260
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:42,812
I changed my mind.

261
00:14:54,371 --> 00:14:56,176
Hi. Remember me?

262
00:14:56,961 --> 00:14:59,656
Another leak in 26, apparently.

263
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,231
I don't see that here.

264
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,735
What? They called, like, 40 minutes ago.

265
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,368
Said it was worse than last time.

266
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,170
I brought the whole crew
out on a Saturday.

267
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,571
You mind if I have a look at that?

268
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:11,306
The notification would
show up right here

269
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:12,541
if you had one.

270
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,409
Can I get some help here? A little help!

271
00:15:14,411 --> 00:15:16,967
Officer, your security guard passed out!

272
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:18,980
- I know CPR.
- I don't know what happened!

273
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:20,314
Get him on the ground!

274
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:21,549
He j-just clutched his chest
and his knees buckled!

275
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,796
I hope he's not having a heart attack.

276
00:15:29,392 --> 00:15:31,392
All right.

277
00:15:34,264 --> 00:15:36,503
- Just put 'em in the back.
- Three down.

278
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:38,166
Police and military radio signals

279
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:38,966
are jammed outside the facility.

280
00:15:38,968 --> 00:15:39,867
Wind direction?

281
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,001
Same as historical record.

282
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:42,270
Okay, you guys to the charges.

283
00:15:42,272 --> 00:15:44,038
We'll find Delaney,
give her the antitoxin,

284
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,406
and explain what's going on.

285
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,074
That'll be interesting.

286
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:49,510
Your reinforcements have been delayed.

287
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:50,944
Bus got stopped at the border.

288
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:52,547
Expired passport.

289
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:55,382
Well, no plan survives
contact with the past, right?

290
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:02,756
3546 in position.

291
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,860
Dr. Delaney?

292
00:16:18,397 --> 00:16:19,788
Hello?

293
00:16:21,567 --> 00:16:23,801
I mean, it is the weekend.

294
00:16:23,803 --> 00:16:25,420
Well, she said she'd be here.

295
00:16:26,284 --> 00:16:28,038
Does it matter?

296
00:16:28,468 --> 00:16:30,444
We don't need her, but I pr...

297
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,310
No, she's not answering her cell.

298
00:16:33,312 --> 00:16:34,584
It just keeps ringing.

299
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:37,147
We're in position.

300
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:38,749
All right.

301
00:16:38,751 --> 00:16:39,816
Go when ready.

302
00:16:39,818 --> 00:16:41,385
Copy.

303
00:16:41,387 --> 00:16:42,653
Hope the wind doesn't change!

304
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:44,120
It won't for hours.

305
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,589
According to the historical
record, it won't,

306
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:48,591
but you said it yourself,
we're starting to see changes.

307
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:50,459
These tanks will be ruptured
by the blast anyway,

308
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:52,796
and the toxic cloud
would be blown toward the city.

309
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,633
A controlled release
allows for a forced evacuation.

310
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,834
Hands in the air!

311
00:16:57,836 --> 00:16:59,002
Move!

312
00:17:03,008 --> 00:17:04,340
Move!

313
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:05,808
This is Morrison. Come in.

314
00:17:06,188 --> 00:17:07,310
Your radio won't work.

315
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:09,011
On your knees
with your hands on your head!

316
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:11,781
Listen! You need to run! Now! That way!

317
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:14,350
I said on your knees
with your hands on your head!

318
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:17,085
Now! I repeat, this is Morrison.

319
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:19,154
And I repeat, your radio will not work.

320
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:20,255
Five seconds.

321
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:22,090
Please, kid! Run!

322
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:23,625
You need to run! Go! Go!

323
00:17:23,627 --> 00:17:24,827
Shut up!

324
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,829
Hands on your head! Last warning!

325
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,599
I'm so sorry.

326
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:54,155
He's not a Van Huizen employee.

327
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:55,364
No, he's not.

328
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,459
Boss, we initiated
the controlled release.

329
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:00,027
The alarm should go any second now.

330
00:18:00,395 --> 00:18:01,896
I regret to report one casualty.

331
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:03,865
Understood.

332
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:05,900
I need you back in building 26 now.

333
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:07,534
We got another problem.

334
00:18:07,536 --> 00:18:10,037
Attention, this is an air quality alert.

335
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,638
All personnel evacuate immediately

336
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,475
or report
to your designated refuge area.

337
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:18,412
Keep moving! Come on, let's go!

338
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:21,948
Okay! Keep moving! Keep moving!
Let's go, let's go!

339
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,484
...all personnel evacuate immediately

340
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:25,051
or report
to your designated refuge area.

341
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:26,152
Keep the change, Omar,

342
00:18:26,154 --> 00:18:27,720
and head east as fast as you can.

343
00:18:29,244 --> 00:18:31,057
You're late, ma'am.

344
00:18:31,396 --> 00:18:32,625
Did you know that older people

345
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:34,394
have a hard time getting
cabs in the city

346
00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:36,363
because apparently we tip like shit?

347
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,697
My new friend taught me that.

348
00:18:38,876 --> 00:18:41,834
Ow! Ohh.

349
00:18:41,836 --> 00:18:45,004
Attention, this is an air quality alert.

350
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:46,005
All personnel...

351
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:47,239
Traveler 3277?

352
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:48,775
Yeah. Park the vehicles near the leak

353
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:50,142
in case a television crew

354
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:52,044
is stupid enough to try to get a shot.

355
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,178
And then get up on the roof.
It's on its way.

356
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,213
Okay. Got it.

357
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:56,015
The device hasn't arrived yet?

358
00:18:56,017 --> 00:18:57,182
Well, it's ten minutes out.

359
00:18:57,184 --> 00:19:00,585
Well, then, I'm not late yet, am I?

360
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:05,024
How far of a walk is it?

361
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:08,227
Can we get the Engineer transport?

362
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:10,296
Walk with me, if we've got the time.

363
00:19:10,841 --> 00:19:12,631
I need the exercise.

364
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:20,539
It's a very simple question, Doctor.

365
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:22,206
What happened to the antimatter?

366
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,775
If this is an interrogation
fantasy you're living out...

367
00:19:23,777 --> 00:19:24,876
Hardly.

368
00:19:24,878 --> 00:19:25,944
Or worse, your way
of getting me to confess

369
00:19:25,946 --> 00:19:27,145
that I failed again...

370
00:19:27,147 --> 00:19:28,246
This is what it is.

371
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:30,549
You can expect charges
of mutiny, sedition,

372
00:19:30,551 --> 00:19:32,050
aiding the enemy, and espionage,

373
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:33,617
and each one carries the death penalty.

374
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:35,553
I already told you what happened!

375
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:37,221
The antimatter we actually created

376
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:39,123
amounted to only a fraction
of what we thought.

377
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:40,124
I think you sold it!

378
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:41,225
What? To who?

379
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:42,226
Russians. North Korea.

380
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:43,127
Any number of foreign powers.

381
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:46,097
Wow. You're right.

382
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,833
And it didn't even take
you long to figure out.

383
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,668
First...

384
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,436
I snuck the material out in my purse.

385
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:54,024
I didn't say I knew how you did it.

386
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,405
I just know you did it.

387
00:19:55,792 --> 00:19:56,807
Major Gleason,

388
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:59,626
I didn't know how big an idiot you were.

389
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,280
I just knew you were an idiot.

390
00:20:15,988 --> 00:20:18,462
She put a biometric
lock on the material.

391
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:20,097
Retinal scan. Delaney's.

392
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:21,199
That's a tough hack.

393
00:20:21,201 --> 00:20:22,333
I guess she didn't trust us.

394
00:20:22,335 --> 00:20:24,167
No, I told her to keep it safe, but...

395
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:26,169
Not safe from us.

396
00:20:26,171 --> 00:20:28,372
Texted her a heads-up
yesterday and this morning.

397
00:20:28,374 --> 00:20:29,640
Can't reach her.

398
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:30,841
Do you think she's been taken

399
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:31,842
somewhere against her will?

400
00:20:31,844 --> 00:20:33,176
That's been goin' around.

401
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:34,211
That casualty that I reported

402
00:20:34,213 --> 00:20:35,212
a few minutes ago

403
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:36,880
wasn't a Van Huizen employee.

404
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,114
Wasn't in uniform,

405
00:20:38,116 --> 00:20:39,782
but I'm pretty sure he was military.

406
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:41,117
I'll look for her.

407
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,653
I'll try and break this lock.

408
00:20:50,462 --> 00:20:52,362
I'm Traveler 117.

409
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:55,332
The Director says hello.

410
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,734
Welcome to the 21st, Engineer.

411
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,035
Call me Bloom.

412
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:02,004
It's wonderful to see you again.

413
00:21:02,006 --> 00:21:04,741
Ahh... You too, kid.

414
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:12,348
How are you coping
with your situation, dear?

415
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,682
Oh, I'm fine, thank you, ma'am.

416
00:21:13,684 --> 00:21:15,751
Uh, it is an honor
to meet you in person.

417
00:21:15,753 --> 00:21:18,387
Oh, please... the honor's mine.

418
00:21:19,032 --> 00:21:20,923
You do know you guys are already famous

419
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:22,524
where I just came from?

420
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:23,525
Really?

421
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:24,760
Not in a good way.

422
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,195
Oh.

423
00:21:26,491 --> 00:21:27,763
There's been a lot of arguments

424
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:29,364
among the project team over you.

425
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:31,767
I should know.
I've argued on both sides.

426
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:34,313
Boy, they ever give you a hard time...

427
00:21:35,015 --> 00:21:38,039
Remind me not to ever
get on your bad side.

428
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:40,575
Wait! You know who abducted my team?

429
00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:42,411
Wasn't anyone on my team.

430
00:21:42,413 --> 00:21:43,912
They were tortured for days!

431
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:46,915
I know what happened, dear.
I'm from the future.

432
00:21:46,917 --> 00:21:48,416
I'm sure it was terrible,

433
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:49,750
but the point is, you found them!

434
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:52,120
Well, we found them.

435
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:54,889
Not that that matters anymore anyway.

436
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:56,090
This is the big day.

437
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:57,525
If this works...

438
00:21:58,594 --> 00:22:00,188
we're done.

439
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:03,898
If this works, we save
tens of millions of lives.

440
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,867
Sure we do,

441
00:22:07,308 --> 00:22:09,804
but you're forgetting the oath
you took before you came.

442
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,941
"At peril of our own birth."

443
00:22:15,578 --> 00:22:17,077
The handsome boy gets it.

444
00:22:18,948 --> 00:22:20,247
Uh...

445
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:22,084
I'm sorry, I don't.

446
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:25,085
They're so cute when they're young.

447
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:27,154
Everything up to now,

448
00:22:27,156 --> 00:22:28,422
all these missions,

449
00:22:28,424 --> 00:22:30,257
they've been preparations,

450
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:32,592
fine-tuning for this moment.

451
00:22:32,594 --> 00:22:34,627
Not that the other work wasn't important

452
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:36,863
or didn't matter, but...

453
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:40,934
If we successfully
deflect asteroid Helios 685,

454
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:43,636
we alter the course of humanity
so profoundly

455
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:46,439
it's highly probable
that the time we come from,

456
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:49,275
everything between then and now,

457
00:22:49,277 --> 00:22:51,677
the plagues, the shortages, the wars,

458
00:22:52,212 --> 00:22:54,165
none of that will happen.

459
00:22:55,049 --> 00:22:58,750
Which means it's also
highly probable that...

460
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:00,486
neither will we.

461
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:13,459
near the Van Huizen research facility

462
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:14,895
as a precaution.

463
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:17,230
While close exposure
is considered fatal,

464
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:20,133
civic authorities are confident
the toxic chemical leak

465
00:23:20,135 --> 00:23:21,301
will dissipate harmlessly...

466
00:23:21,303 --> 00:23:22,568
We shouldn't have stopped

467
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,636
to take a picture of that dog.

468
00:23:23,638 --> 00:23:24,637
It was a bear,

469
00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:26,506
and it took all of 30 seconds.

470
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:28,569
It was that damn border crossing.

471
00:23:29,211 --> 00:23:31,254
...but as a precaution,
city residents...

472
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:37,583
This is Carly. The device has arrived,

473
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:38,851
and it's being lowered into position.

474
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,019
How's the perimeter looking?

475
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:41,854
Non-traveler responders keep showing up,

476
00:23:41,856 --> 00:23:43,215
and we keep telling them to leave.

477
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:45,309
Sooner or later, someone's not
gonna take no for an answer.

478
00:23:45,311 --> 00:23:47,010
I could use those reinforcements.

479
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:48,945
Well, just keep saying no, Carly.

480
00:23:48,947 --> 00:23:50,814
I don't know what else to tell you.

481
00:23:50,816 --> 00:23:52,364
Copy.

482
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Laser's here. I'm here.

483
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:59,889
All we need now is access
to the antimatter.

484
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:02,258
And there's no way to bypass the scan?

485
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,626
Well, Philip's gonna
run a software hack,

486
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:05,361
but Delaney did an excellent job.

487
00:24:05,689 --> 00:24:06,862
We may be stuck.

488
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,497
Imagine why you're famous.

489
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:10,466
This isn't really a problem.

490
00:24:10,468 --> 00:24:11,667
With or without Delaney,

491
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:13,035
we can trigger containment failure

492
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:14,704
by shutting off its power supply.

493
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:16,071
Do it that way, and we risk

494
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:17,940
an asymmetrical collapse
of the magnetic bottle.

495
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:19,641
Now, would you please stop improvising

496
00:24:19,643 --> 00:24:21,376
for one damn minute?

497
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,846
Power shut-off has always
been the contingency.

498
00:24:23,848 --> 00:24:25,214
An X-ray laser works

499
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:27,716
by translating
a very specific amount of energy

500
00:24:27,718 --> 00:24:30,352
from an antimatter or nuclear explosion

501
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:32,354
into a coherent beam of X-rays.

502
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:33,956
Too much, and you overload the laser.

503
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:36,157
Too little,
and it won't deflect the target.

504
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,326
This is my swan song, MacLaren.

505
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:40,194
I would like to get it right,

506
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:42,364
and I would like to be the one
who turns the key.

507
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:44,699
I do not care to wing this!

508
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,507
How's your search going?

509
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:56,410
I just found a car on security logs

510
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,412
arriving at the facility
early this morning

511
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,848
and leaving five minutes after.

512
00:25:01,205 --> 00:25:03,684
I can't identify the occupants,
but I do have a plate.

513
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:05,419
Good. Locate that car.

514
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,121
We've still got time to get her here.

515
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:09,810
At least find her eye.
That's all we really need.

516
00:25:11,328 --> 00:25:13,794
I'll be checking
my science project on the roof

517
00:25:13,796 --> 00:25:15,796
if anybody needs me.

518
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:18,865
She's been like that
for a hundred years.

519
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:20,233
Don't take it personally.

520
00:25:20,235 --> 00:25:22,303
Yeah.

521
00:25:24,945 --> 00:25:26,873
Private Wilson
suffered third-degree burns

522
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:28,708
over 20% of his body.

523
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,944
He spent the last several weeks
in a coma.

524
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,279
Whoever intercepted his truck

525
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,713
made it look like containment failed

526
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:34,948
and then there was an explosion.

527
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,982
How did you let that happen?

528
00:25:35,984 --> 00:25:37,550
Where were you during all this?

529
00:25:37,552 --> 00:25:38,785
Wilson came out of his coma
in the middle of the night,

530
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,220
and I spoke to him.

531
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:42,755
He told me a woman stopped him
in the middle of the road,

532
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:44,223
"just standing there."

533
00:25:44,688 --> 00:25:45,625
Damn it.

534
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,960
You just keep getting it right.

535
00:25:48,273 --> 00:25:49,362
The second you left,

536
00:25:49,364 --> 00:25:50,630
I took off in my invisible helicopter.

537
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,131
This is not funny!

538
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,333
If you actually listen to yourself,

539
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:54,600
it's hilarious!

540
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:56,769
Your own piece-of-shit
portable containment unit

541
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:57,903
weighed a couple tons,

542
00:25:57,905 --> 00:25:59,238
and needed a Mack truck
to pull it around.

543
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,572
How the hell would I...?

544
00:26:00,574 --> 00:26:02,552
There are plenty of foreign powers
capable of engineering this, Doctor!

545
00:26:02,554 --> 00:26:04,109
Why would I have waited
until you took it from me

546
00:26:04,111 --> 00:26:06,252
to sell it if I already had it?

547
00:26:06,254 --> 00:26:07,313
A few minutes ago,

548
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,848
you were sticking to your story
that it never existed.

549
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:20,592
Hey, David, it's me.

550
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:23,762
Uh, guess it's my turn
to leave you a goofy message.

551
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:25,846
Um... I just know

552
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:27,766
how stressed out you get
when you don't hear from me,

553
00:26:27,768 --> 00:26:29,934
so I... wanted to let you know

554
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,170
that I might be away for a while,

555
00:26:32,172 --> 00:26:35,974
and maybe even relocated.

556
00:26:35,976 --> 00:26:38,109
I just don't want you
wondering or worrying

557
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:39,543
if you don't hear from me.

558
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:41,712
You know, if it happens,

559
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:43,047
I mean, I don't know for sure
that it will,

560
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,849
but if it does,

561
00:26:45,443 --> 00:26:46,951
I just want to thank you

562
00:26:47,432 --> 00:26:50,349
for always being there for me
when I really needed someone.

563
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:56,416
You know, in another time
or another life, right?

564
00:26:57,652 --> 00:26:59,844
Okay, uh...

565
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:02,733
Goodbye, David.

566
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:11,875
I spent my life designing that thing.

567
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:14,878
Now I'm just gonna blow it up.

568
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,515
How's that for the circle of life?

569
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:22,685
- Oh!
- Are you feeling ill?

570
00:27:22,687 --> 00:27:26,255
My host was dying of cancer.

571
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:28,157
Whatever pain medication she was on...

572
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,158
I'll go grab you something.

573
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,860
No. Wait.

574
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:34,196
Are you serious?

575
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,666
One of the best pain
meds there ever was.

576
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:41,037
I mean, she's... she's not wrong.

577
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,104
The firing window

578
00:27:42,106 --> 00:27:44,873
is 2 hours, 4 minutes,
and 11 seconds away.

579
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,708
All I got to do is turn a key.

580
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,844
I'd rather not do it in pain.

581
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:50,846
I'll check inside.

582
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,056
Oh. I'm good.

583
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,793
Trev?

584
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,247
What happened?

585
00:28:06,964 --> 00:28:08,093
Progress?

586
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:12,300
I think my hacking attempts
triggered a silent alarm.

587
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:15,630
It's pinging to a remote I.P.

588
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:17,138
Can you I.D. the location?

589
00:28:17,714 --> 00:28:19,107
Hold that thought.

590
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:20,575
Sir!

591
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:23,780
It was in her bag.

592
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:27,414
What is this?

593
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:31,586
What does this mean?

594
00:28:31,588 --> 00:28:32,553
Hello!

595
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:33,888
I'll take Marcy.

596
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,523
You send me the coordinates en route!

597
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:36,891
It means that your people are in my lab

598
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:38,425
trying to break into
the containment unit,

599
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:40,060
and they don't know
what they're frigging doing.

600
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:41,228
The only guy I've got there

601
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,163
couldn't break into his own lunchbox.

602
00:28:43,165 --> 00:28:45,432
Tell me who that is!

603
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:50,604
Where are you going?

604
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,439
Philip found Delaney.
The Engineer wants her here.

605
00:28:52,441 --> 00:28:53,607
We can't hold them off much longer.

606
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:54,908
We just need an hour or so.

607
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,077
Give us a head start,
then blow the second charge.

608
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,668
All right. Go get her.

609
00:28:59,726 --> 00:29:00,914
Trevor, blow the main.

610
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,582
Copy.

611
00:29:06,755 --> 00:29:07,921
All right.

612
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:10,356
Okay, this is a deadly,
toxic gas, people.

613
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:13,126
Get in your vehicles
and get out of here now!

614
00:29:14,195 --> 00:29:15,261
Go!

615
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,034
Ever get the feeling

616
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,562
you're heading in the wrong direction?

617
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,604
Well, at least we can say we saw a dog.

618
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:37,484
It was a bear!

619
00:29:39,093 --> 00:29:41,778
It was a beautiful living thing...

620
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,346
out in the world.

621
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,550
Excuse me, Major.

622
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:50,052
There's a Special Agent from the FBI

623
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,119
who wants to talk.

624
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:52,321
Tell him I'm busy.

625
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,122
Not to you, sir. To her.

626
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,237
Special Agent...?

627
00:30:09,871 --> 00:30:11,773
MacLaren, FBI.

628
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:12,741
You're Major...?

629
00:30:12,743 --> 00:30:14,342
Gleason.

630
00:30:14,344 --> 00:30:15,610
You must be who triggered
Delaney's little alarm.

631
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:17,112
Actually, the Doctor is part
of an ongoing investigation

632
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:19,715
that the Bureau has
had underway for months,

633
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:20,815
so you can imagine our surprise

634
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:21,949
when you show up out of nowhere

635
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:23,594
and take her to wherever
the hell this is.

636
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:24,745
This place...

637
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:26,254
Obviously not
an official military facility,

638
00:30:26,256 --> 00:30:27,488
which is the only place

639
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,123
you'd have any sort of jurisdiction

640
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,092
or the right to question anybody,

641
00:30:31,094 --> 00:30:32,530
let alone Delaney.

642
00:30:33,062 --> 00:30:34,895
All right, so tell me,
who's she selling to?

643
00:30:34,897 --> 00:30:35,796
Selling to?

644
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:37,131
What're you doing? Major...

645
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:38,298
- I have good reason to Sus...
- This is not your job.

646
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,268
It is, however, my job.
Do you understand that?

647
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,569
You know what?

648
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:44,205
I've had enough of this conversation.

649
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:46,673
Let me see her right now,
before I call your superiors

650
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:48,442
and tell them you've been freelancing

651
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:51,078
as a part-time private detective.

652
00:31:03,954 --> 00:31:05,655
I give up. Where is she?

653
00:31:06,328 --> 00:31:07,160
Lock down the building.

654
00:31:07,162 --> 00:31:08,528
Find her!

655
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,496
Gleason, you gotta be kidding me!

656
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:11,631
My men will find her!

657
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:14,000
No! They will stand down
and stay out of this!

658
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:15,468
What the hell is wrong with you?

659
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,837
Who knows what damage you've done.

660
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:22,642
I've released
all non-essential personnel.

661
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:23,877
Where are my reinforcements?

662
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:25,211
They should be there any minute.

663
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:26,512
Can I get up now?

664
00:31:26,514 --> 00:31:27,780
What's going...

665
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:30,783
Ow! What the hell is that?

666
00:31:30,785 --> 00:31:32,151
It's an antitoxin

667
00:31:32,153 --> 00:31:34,052
for the chemical leak at Van Huizen.

668
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:35,554
What chemical leak?

669
00:31:35,556 --> 00:31:36,656
Well, that's part
of a longer conversation.

670
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:38,524
You found my biometric lock.

671
00:31:38,526 --> 00:31:41,119
Uh-huh. And we're gonna
need you to unlock it.

672
00:31:45,365 --> 00:31:46,496
Finally.

673
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:55,073
You're late!

674
00:31:55,075 --> 00:31:56,275
Long drive.

675
00:31:56,632 --> 00:31:57,843
You know where you need to go?

676
00:31:57,845 --> 00:31:59,077
Restroom.

677
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,846
Then, yeah, we know
what we're here to do.

678
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:03,848
Let's go.

679
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:10,655
...while close
exposure could be fatal...

680
00:32:10,657 --> 00:32:11,956
Sir? You should see this.

681
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:13,858
...Civic authorities are confident

682
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,493
the toxic chemical leak

683
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,561
will dissipate harmlessly
and soon be under control.

684
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,163
We haven't heard from Morrison?

685
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:20,998
I can't reach him either.

686
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,634
...clearing the cloud away
from densely populated areas...

687
00:32:23,636 --> 00:32:25,672
Can you guys be somewhere else
for a few minutes?

688
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:28,040
You're fine. Go back to work.

689
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:31,008
Oh, you son of a bitch.

690
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,744
I need the squad fully armed
and ready to go right now.

691
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:39,750
All right, leave two on that bus,

692
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:40,917
you stay down here.

693
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,386
The rest of your squad
over on that roof.

694
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:43,587
Yours, over there.

695
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,021
That'll place any attacking force

696
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:47,591
in a field of fire between you, okay?

697
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:49,259
Protocol 3 hasn't been waived.

698
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:50,626
They won't know about Protocol 3.

699
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:51,928
They're gonna figure
it out pretty quick.

700
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,196
Let me worry about that.

701
00:32:53,198 --> 00:32:54,530
Who's your best sniper?

702
00:32:54,532 --> 00:32:55,730
Uh, Becky.

703
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:58,735
Becky...

704
00:32:58,737 --> 00:32:59,905
You're with me.

705
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:32,582
What the hell is that thing?

706
00:33:33,271 --> 00:33:34,270
That's also part

707
00:33:34,272 --> 00:33:35,824
of a longer conversation.

708
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:40,509
Cutting it close.

709
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:43,011
There's plenty of time.

710
00:33:43,793 --> 00:33:45,393
I wish.

711
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:57,959
Me too.

712
00:34:02,858 --> 00:34:03,857
Hi.

713
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:04,982
Hello.

714
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:09,305
I heard you the first time! No!

715
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,539
For Christ's sakes,
someone knock the woman out,

716
00:34:11,541 --> 00:34:13,373
point her eye at the damn thing,
and let's get on with it!

717
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:15,008
And you are?

718
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:17,044
The Engineer who designed
that thing on your roof.

719
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:18,111
Call me Bloom.

720
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:19,212
What is that thing?

721
00:34:20,215 --> 00:34:21,348
Tell her.

722
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,883
It's an X-ray laser.

723
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:24,652
And we're back to no.

724
00:34:24,654 --> 00:34:27,154
Look! Travelers like ourselves

725
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:28,655
have been building and
assembling components for this

726
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:29,656
for over a year.

727
00:34:29,658 --> 00:34:31,058
To do what with it?

728
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,059
There's an asteroid

729
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:33,560
on a collision course with Earth

730
00:34:33,562 --> 00:34:34,828
called "Helios 685."

731
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,363
It hasn't been detected yet,

732
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,965
but when it strikes the Atlantic Ocean

733
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,232
in 18 months' time,

734
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:41,969
the wave will knock out
most of the Eastern Seaboard,

735
00:34:41,971 --> 00:34:43,971
resulting in environmental effects,

736
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:45,304
shortages, and wars

737
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:47,406
from which there will be no recovery.

738
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:49,342
How the hell could you
possibly know all of this?

739
00:34:49,344 --> 00:34:50,543
We're from the future.

740
00:34:50,545 --> 00:34:52,378
Just came from there myself.

741
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,304
I don't recommend it.

742
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:56,649
Why wasn't this asteroid detected?

743
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:58,184
Helios will be detected

744
00:34:58,186 --> 00:35:00,453
two months from now,
but, by then, it's too late.

745
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:03,755
If my X-ray laser is fired
precisely 12 minutes from now,

746
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:08,027
the beam will strike Helios
and deflect it by .07 degrees.

747
00:35:08,029 --> 00:35:09,661
Enough to miss the Earth in 18 months.

748
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:10,762
A near-miss

749
00:35:10,764 --> 00:35:11,763
that will hopefully

750
00:35:11,765 --> 00:35:13,132
bring the nations of the world together,

751
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:15,601
and make them realize what
the hell they've got to lose.

752
00:35:15,603 --> 00:35:16,435
You've seen the laser.

753
00:35:16,437 --> 00:35:17,669
You know damn well

754
00:35:17,671 --> 00:35:20,171
the 21st century has nothing like it.

755
00:35:22,877 --> 00:35:23,876
To power it,

756
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:24,943
you need the energy release

757
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:27,139
of a matter-antimatter detonation.

758
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:30,916
The blast radius could be miles wide.

759
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:33,852
People will die, yes.

760
00:35:33,854 --> 00:35:36,021
Certainly everyone here,

761
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:39,690
but the laser will translate
most of that energy

762
00:35:39,692 --> 00:35:40,625
into the beam.

763
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:45,563
Doctor, we would rather
do this with your help...

764
00:35:46,766 --> 00:35:48,766
but we are doing this.

765
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,707
By all means, dear, take your time.

766
00:35:59,845 --> 00:36:01,045
I'm going to exact revenge

767
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,880
on the destruction of the Cetan.

768
00:36:04,186 --> 00:36:05,018
They're coming.

769
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:11,524
Fire teams, stand by.

770
00:36:11,526 --> 00:36:13,726
A full squad just entered the compound.

771
00:36:13,728 --> 00:36:16,263
We're close, Carly.
You need to hold them back.

772
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:18,231
Hold who back?

773
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:20,209
Gleason and his men.

774
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:21,400
You're up, Doctor.

775
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:29,542
Stand by.

776
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:34,080
Now!

777
00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:38,651
Take cover!

778
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:40,152
Yes, Major! Copy that!

779
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:43,222
You focus on the officer.

780
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:45,124
Protocol 3 is enforced.

781
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:02,891
Good day, Dr. Delaney.

782
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:40,878
They're not shooting to kill!

783
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,212
Let's go, boys! Take 'em down!

784
00:37:42,214 --> 00:37:43,380
Move, move, move!

785
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:46,983
You should know

786
00:37:46,985 --> 00:37:49,953
I'm hardest on people
I think have the most potential.

787
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:51,855
Armed.

788
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:53,557
Okay. We're armed.

789
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,959
Take Dr. Delaney with you.
The future could use her.

790
00:37:55,961 --> 00:37:57,774
We're not going anywhere. We're
staying till this is done.

791
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,114
If you hadn't brought Delaney here,

792
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:00,214
I be forced to agree with you,

793
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:02,132
but there's just time to get her
to minimum safe distance.

794
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:04,233
The soldiers will eventually
make it inside.

795
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:05,902
Then there'll be no getting out of here,

796
00:38:05,904 --> 00:38:08,137
and it'll be in the hands
of the Director.

797
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:10,040
Now do you get it?

798
00:38:37,835 --> 00:38:40,703
Request permission to use deadly force!

799
00:38:40,705 --> 00:38:42,905
Negative, we're coming
out the south door.

800
00:38:42,907 --> 00:38:45,893
Have your teams give cover fire
and meet us on the way.

801
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:47,088
Orders from the Engineer.

802
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,012
We've got to get Delaney
to safe distance.

803
00:38:49,912 --> 00:38:50,972
Go, go, go, go, go!

804
00:38:50,997 --> 00:38:52,063
Move it! Move it!

805
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:54,609
I got the door!

806
00:38:57,921 --> 00:38:59,020
Go, go, go, go!

807
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:44,161
It's medicinal...

808
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:45,930
I swear.

809
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:52,136
Cover fire, now!

810
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:03,113
Carly, come on!

811
00:40:04,216 --> 00:40:05,182
Everybody, get down!

812
00:40:12,824 --> 00:40:13,957
Step away!

813
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:19,600
I'd tell you to run...

814
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:22,532
but with less than 87 seconds to go,

815
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:23,700
we're past that now.

816
00:40:23,702 --> 00:40:25,234
Stop!

817
00:40:25,236 --> 00:40:26,836
- I guess it's too much to ask...
- Stand down! that is an order!

818
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,705
That I be the one
who turns the key when...

819
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:46,889
Make sure she's dead.

820
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:53,528
Aah!

821
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,683
Stop!

822
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:09,474
What are you doing? Soldier!

823
00:41:10,914 --> 00:41:12,013
Soldier, stop! That is an order!

824
00:41:17,954 --> 00:41:20,922
Aah!

825
00:41:35,304 --> 00:41:37,605
Stop! What are you doing?

826
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:38,439
Soldier!

827
00:41:38,441 --> 00:41:40,241
Stand down! Stop, sir!

828
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,968
Sergeant! No! Stand down!

829
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,257
No. No!

830
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:49,040
Aah! Aah!

831
00:43:01,688 --> 00:43:03,521
That's time.

832
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:25,642
