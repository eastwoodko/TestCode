1
00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:01,668
Previously on Travelers.

2
00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:04,351
This one's a solo assignment.
I'm flying to D.C.

3
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:07,089
Flight 329 to Washington.
It just took off.

4
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,534
Kat, what are you doing here?

5
00:00:08,536 --> 00:00:11,726
The police officer said that
you're sleeping with his wife.

6
00:00:11,728 --> 00:00:14,862
329 to Washington goes down at 2:53 p.m.

7
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:17,531
Trevor, you need to tell me
how to make a two-person stasis field

8
00:00:17,533 --> 00:00:19,100
hold more than two people.

9
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,046
Some of them could survive if
they were in the tail section?

10
00:00:21,048 --> 00:00:24,438
No, that's not what he said.
The G-forces would be huge.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,606
No, don't go.

12
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:26,773
You're gonna be okay.

13
00:00:39,027 --> 00:00:40,526
Let go of me!

14
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:42,061
Where's my husband?

15
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:44,397
We can't leave him there!
We have to go back!

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,777
Shut her up, Marcy.

17
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:46,997
Yeah, we'll have to do more than that.

18
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:48,467
We can't have her remember any of this.

19
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:49,735
Sooner or later,

20
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,236
I'll need to give her
an HDAC2 inhibitor.

21
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:52,570
What?

22
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:53,838
Who the hell are you people?
Let go of me!

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,473
Can you hurry up, please?

24
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:56,841
She's stronger than she looks.

25
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:58,143
It's coming. Could you
at least slow down a little?

26
00:00:58,145 --> 00:00:59,577
We can't be tied to the crash site

27
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,978
in any of the media reports.

28
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,248
Kathryn! Just relax.

29
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,508
How do you know my name?

30
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:07,551
Okay. Listen to me.

31
00:01:07,553 --> 00:01:09,586
My husband was on that flight.

32
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:11,021
He's with the FBI.

33
00:01:11,023 --> 00:01:14,058
He had this device...
that's what saved me, and...

34
00:01:16,895 --> 00:01:18,062
That should buy us some silence

35
00:01:18,064 --> 00:01:19,396
until I can administer the inhibitor.

36
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:20,931
I don't know how he stands her.

37
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:24,434
Boss, are you there?

38
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:26,769
MacLaren can't possibly hear you.

39
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:29,605
In fact, I doubt the G-forces
of an impact like that

40
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:30,606
are survivable.

41
00:01:30,608 --> 00:01:32,041
Somebody thinks it is.

42
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:34,177
That EMTs who took him were our people.

43
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:35,411
They had to be.

44
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,012
She's right. They had to have known

45
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,514
when and where
the plane was coming down.

46
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,015
The Director would have assigned a team

47
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,783
to resuscitate him and Bishop.

48
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:43,292
Try his cell phone.

49
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,560
Hello?

50
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:53,128
Who is this?

51
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,663
Deal with the wife,
then come to OPs A.S.A.P.

52
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:57,011
Is he alive?

53
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,665
Clean up the mess you've created,

54
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,701
then we'll talk about the next steps.

55
00:02:20,455 --> 00:02:21,588
Should we put her in bed properly?

56
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,667
You don't have to whisper.

57
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:23,856
You could scream
at the top of your lungs

58
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,125
and she wouldn't hear you.

59
00:02:25,127 --> 00:02:27,293
Especially after I give her this.

60
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:32,346
You have memory inhibitor in your bag?

61
00:02:32,371 --> 00:02:34,633
Yeah. Every Traveler medic has
to have a few doses on hand

62
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:35,878
in case of emergencies.

63
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,136
How much will she forget?

64
00:02:37,138 --> 00:02:38,737
Most of yesterday.

65
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:41,731
I do not envy the hangover
she's about to wake up with.

66
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:43,575
Okay, grab a pair of shoes for him too,

67
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:45,577
then go help Philip set the scene.

68
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:57,321
Oh, the fun they had.

69
00:02:57,323 --> 00:02:58,856
How much alcohol would it take

70
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:01,125
for somebody to black out
the previous day?

71
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:03,446
I don't know. I only use heroin.

72
00:03:04,808 --> 00:03:06,663
Let's go with "lots."

73
00:03:25,694 --> 00:03:28,284
You can put the weapon down.
We're not a threat.

74
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:29,451
Who are you?

75
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:31,654
Traveler D13.

76
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:32,788
"D"?

77
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,822
D is for "doctor."

78
00:03:33,824 --> 00:03:36,066
Also, in my case, Derek.

79
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:38,394
I thought your team was reserved
for heads of state.

80
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:39,895
That was our first mission, yes,

81
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:40,887
but now we save

82
00:03:40,912 --> 00:03:43,398
whoever the Director
tells us to save, worldwide.

83
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,246
We've already started the work.

84
00:03:52,008 --> 00:03:53,641
Can he be saved?

85
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,544
If we can stabilize him,
stop his internal hemorrhaging,

86
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:59,213
replace or rebuild
one or more of his organs,

87
00:03:59,215 --> 00:04:00,479
assuming one of you

88
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:02,249
is a suitable living donor
and willing to volunteer.

89
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:03,717
Of course.

90
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,828
Then maybe.

91
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:41,453
Oh...

92
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:46,569
Ow. Oh, my...

93
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:02,539
Oh...

94
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,639
Grant?

95
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,386
Grant?

96
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,292
He looks a lot better
than he did last night.

97
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,834
On the outside.

98
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,669
That's the easy part.

99
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,337
But all the damage is on the inside.

100
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,405
His brain, his major organs.

101
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,874
Took all night just to stabilize him.

102
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:53,176
They don't really look like
they're working on him at all.

103
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:56,179
That's because nano technology's
doing most of the work.

104
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,180
Really?

105
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,548
Graphene-based?

106
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,883
As advanced as I've ever seen.

107
00:06:59,885 --> 00:07:03,152
I mean, without them,
with that amount of internal damage,

108
00:07:03,154 --> 00:07:04,920
he wouldn't have stood a chance,

109
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:06,822
but even a full suite of medical nanites

110
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:07,923
can only do so much.

111
00:07:09,326 --> 00:07:11,093
Well, I'm in over my head here

112
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,596
and there are more loose
ends I got to clean up, so...

113
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:14,997
Where are you going?

114
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,432
The airport.

115
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,868
If he wasn't on the plane,
why is his car parked there?

116
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,836
Right. Go.

117
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,874
All right, 0115, you're up.

118
00:07:25,876 --> 00:07:28,042
Ready when you are, Derek.

119
00:07:28,044 --> 00:07:29,677
We've grown it to the first stage,

120
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,379
but we have to grow the organ
the rest of the way

121
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:32,447
internally.

122
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:34,531
Yeah. Where are you growing it?
Do you have to cut me open?

123
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,117
Cut you? No.

124
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,085
It will find its own way.

125
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:40,086
I don't really like the sound of that.

126
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:41,422
You're not gonna like
how it feels, either.

127
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:42,865
Lay down, please.

128
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:51,264
This is gonna hurt a lot.

129
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:00,773
Oh!

130
00:09:18,983 --> 00:09:20,982
I'm scrubbing in.

131
00:09:20,984 --> 00:09:22,717
You're welcome to,
but it's not necessary.

132
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:26,721
He's the leader of my team.
I wasn't asking for permission.

133
00:09:47,876 --> 00:09:49,861
I... pay here?

134
00:09:50,145 --> 00:09:51,344
You, uh, mind if I look

135
00:09:51,346 --> 00:09:53,547
at your license
and registration, please, sir?

136
00:09:54,196 --> 00:09:56,712
Right, I should have that...

137
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:03,589
Just, uh, picking it up for a friend.

138
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:04,924
Uh-huh.

139
00:10:05,442 --> 00:10:06,992
It says here this vehicle is registered

140
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:09,061
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

141
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:10,829
That's who my friend works for.

142
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,530
Step out of the vehicle please, sir.

143
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:15,332
Is there a problem? I have his key.

144
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:16,601
Grant MacLaren's...

145
00:10:16,603 --> 00:10:18,235
Yeah, you read that on the registration.

146
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,271
Now step out of the vehicle.

147
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,981
Turn around.

148
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:36,152
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

149
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:50,132
Do you mind opening the gate, please?

150
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,893
Adding stage-3 nanites.

151
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,072
I've never seen that before.

152
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:51,879
Are you all right?

153
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,447
Absolutely.

154
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:06,625
Now let's see if this pancreas
needs to be replaced.

155
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,267
Ready suction?

156
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,852
We're getting close.

157
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:41,123
The bathrooms are done.
The kitchen looks great.

158
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:44,494
This place is gonna feel
like home in no time.

159
00:12:45,863 --> 00:12:47,797
Oh, what? Is the vacuum cleaner broken?

160
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,299
No, I don't think so.

161
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,701
Just sucked up something
underneath the couch.

162
00:12:51,703 --> 00:12:53,869
Oh. Got it.

163
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:56,805
Oops.

164
00:12:57,874 --> 00:12:59,308
Don't look at me.

165
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,676
It's your fault they were under there.

166
00:13:00,678 --> 00:13:02,977
I'm just worried I'm gonna find

167
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:03,812
your bra in here next.

168
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:04,646
Stop.

169
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:39,036
Need another unit of blood.

170
00:13:39,165 --> 00:13:41,366
I'll go get it.

171
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:58,530
You still with me?

172
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:00,123
What?

173
00:14:00,566 --> 00:14:01,827
You've been quiet.

174
00:14:02,695 --> 00:14:04,502
I was thinking.

175
00:14:04,504 --> 00:14:06,337
About never trying bodysurfing again?

176
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:09,096
There's that.

177
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:12,943
Whenever I'm on vacation
for any length of time,

178
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:14,379
I just start thinking

179
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:16,514
about how much more
I could be doing with my life.

180
00:14:17,058 --> 00:14:18,082
Like?

181
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:20,017
I don't know.

182
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,387
My dad was a cop, now I'm FBI.

183
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:25,756
I mean, Jesus.
Talk about lack of imagination.

184
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:27,257
But you love the FBI.

185
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:28,858
Well, "like."

186
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,295
And you're really good at it.

187
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:33,430
So I keep telling you.

188
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,732
Well, maybe you're just ready

189
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:37,301
for a new challenge

190
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,067
that doesn't have
to come from your work.

191
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:40,869
Oh, God, we're about to have the baby

192
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,018
discussion again, aren't we?

193
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:44,340
- Did I even say the word?
- Oh, it's so...

194
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,274
- Stop! I didn't...
- I can see it all over you.

195
00:14:45,276 --> 00:14:47,610
It's in your eyes. I know that look.

196
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:51,747
Oh, shoot.

197
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:54,450
We've got a flat tire. It's okay.

198
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,651
How's he doing?

199
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,889
Sternal fracture,

200
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:03,991
hemothorax and pulmonary contusion.

201
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:07,429
Whatever. I mean, how's it looking?

202
00:15:07,431 --> 00:15:08,896
Is he going to be all right?

203
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:11,299
It's way too soon to say.

204
00:15:11,982 --> 00:15:13,934
We've barely started,

205
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:17,270
plus... there's a problem
with his heart.

206
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,408
What's wrong?

207
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,741
It's damaged beyond
the nanite repair capability.

208
00:15:20,743 --> 00:15:22,142
The Director wouldn't have sent them

209
00:15:22,144 --> 00:15:23,444
if there wasn't a chance.

210
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:26,913
The Director's not infallible.

211
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:30,316
But he is in the best hands
I know of in any century.

212
00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:35,488
Okay.

213
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,936
Did you find it?

214
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:53,872
Hmm? Oh.

215
00:15:53,874 --> 00:15:55,273
Yeah, that's it. Thanks.

216
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,343
Yeah.

217
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:02,514
I wish I could be more helpful.

218
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:03,981
You are helping.

219
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,317
Yeah, clearly you'd be lost without me.

220
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:13,391
I really would be, Grant.

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,900
Hey.

222
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:25,268
I just got a call from local PD.

223
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,236
Parking attendant
called in a vehicle theft.

224
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:29,238
License plate matches Mac's SUV.

225
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,040
Seriously? I just texted him.

226
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:33,676
Maybe he doesn't know yet.

227
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:43,485
You've reached
Special Agent Grant MacLaren...

228
00:17:08,377 --> 00:17:09,610
Hello?

229
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,445
Hey, Kat. It's Walt. Is Mac with you?

230
00:17:12,222 --> 00:17:13,713
I thought he was with you.

231
00:17:13,715 --> 00:17:15,081
Nope. I guess

232
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,750
we're getting our wires crossed.

233
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:18,752
Look, sorry to bother you.

234
00:17:18,754 --> 00:17:20,454
Uh, wait. I...

235
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,637
Hello.

236
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,721
Shit.

237
00:17:59,092 --> 00:18:00,291
Hey...

238
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:02,126
You don't look good.

239
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,259
Thanks.

240
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:04,495
I'm serious.

241
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:05,796
I can tell.

242
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:07,631
You should lie down.

243
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:10,000
Guys?

244
00:18:10,002 --> 00:18:11,167
What is it, Philip?

245
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:13,269
We have a situation.

246
00:18:13,848 --> 00:18:15,071
I need an evac.

247
00:18:15,566 --> 00:18:16,507
How fast?

248
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:18,408
Now?

249
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,218
All right. Hang tight.

250
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,077
I'm on my way.

251
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:26,983
You need to tell the doctor.
Maybe something isn't right.

252
00:18:26,985 --> 00:18:28,350
Derek?

253
00:18:28,352 --> 00:18:30,119
He's the one who told me
it was gonna hurt.

254
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:32,788
They can give you something.

255
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,190
Ah... Little pain toward a good cause.

256
00:18:36,793 --> 00:18:39,093
A lot of pain toward a good cause.

257
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:42,463
Go help Philip.

258
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:43,832
I'm fine.

259
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:52,106
The nanites have nearly
repaired the pancreas.

260
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:55,637
Good. But if they can't
normalize his neural activity,

261
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,277
it won't matter how well
we fix his body.

262
00:19:05,054 --> 00:19:06,219
Okay, good.

263
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:08,476
Now it's time to take the shot.
All right?

264
00:19:08,478 --> 00:19:11,624
I need you to stand
as still as possible.

265
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:12,892
All right?

266
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:16,328
Apply gentle but steady pressure
to the trigger.

267
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,998
The shot should
almost come as a surprise, okay?

268
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:22,168
Your breathing should stay...

269
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,369
Surprise!

270
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:26,739
Kat, you need to
take firearms seriously.

271
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:28,239
I'll show you how serious I am.

272
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:29,841
And you need to keep
your barrel downrange.

273
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:31,710
And you need to
keep your barrel downrange.

274
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,344
All right. You said
you wanted to do this,

275
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:34,345
but if you don't...

276
00:19:34,347 --> 00:19:35,480
No. I do. I do. I like it here.

277
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:36,815
It feels dangerous.

278
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:38,703
'Cause it is dangerous. Now, come on.

279
00:19:38,705 --> 00:19:39,918
Okay. Okay. Let me try again.

280
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,887
All right.

281
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,039
Now, take your aim.

282
00:19:44,064 --> 00:19:45,025
Mm-hmm.

283
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:45,923
And gently...

284
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:46,991
Ooh.

285
00:19:46,993 --> 00:19:48,659
...Squeeze the trigger.

286
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,064
Oh, my god! I shot a gun.

287
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,431
How about two more shots?

288
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:56,366
Okay.

289
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,871
Hey! Look at that.

290
00:20:00,873 --> 00:20:01,871
Five shots,

291
00:20:01,873 --> 00:20:04,273
and the target's completely unscathed.

292
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:05,274
That is a record.

293
00:20:05,276 --> 00:20:06,743
Oh...

294
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:09,425
I'm not sure I like that I liked that.

295
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,748
Well, you did it.
You don't have to like it.

296
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,116
I like that I like you.

297
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:15,051
"Like"? Really? That's...

298
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:16,352
That's the best you got?

299
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:17,754
Really, really like?

300
00:20:18,118 --> 00:20:19,955
Kinda prefer a different word.

301
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:21,423
Want?

302
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:22,791
Oh, I hadn't thought of that word.

303
00:20:22,793 --> 00:20:23,792
Need?

304
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:25,060
That's even better.

305
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:26,394
Now?

306
00:20:26,396 --> 00:20:28,697
Yeah, that's my favorite one so far.

307
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:06,499
I need you to run
a facial recognition check.

308
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,702
This is the guy who
took off with Mac's SUV.

309
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:11,203
Well, I'll give you this one for free.

310
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:12,437
That's Philip Pearson.

311
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:14,762
Your partner had me
run him a few weeks ago.

312
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:16,876
Are you sure that's him?

313
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:19,111
Yeah, MacLaren got all aggro about it.

314
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:21,781
Won't be forgetting
that face any time soon.

315
00:21:21,783 --> 00:21:23,732
That's Philip Pearson.

316
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,201
I've started to worry

317
00:22:01,226 --> 00:22:03,792
that we're gonna regret
not having children.

318
00:22:03,794 --> 00:22:05,294
Are you having actual regret,

319
00:22:05,296 --> 00:22:07,730
or just the fear of having regret?

320
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,466
The fear one, I think.

321
00:22:10,889 --> 00:22:12,534
What about you?

322
00:22:12,536 --> 00:22:14,314
I'm gonna plead the fifth.

323
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:17,072
Grant, we haven't
talked about it in ages,

324
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:18,573
and we're getting older.

325
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:20,208
You can say that again.

326
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,809
But there's new technologies.

327
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:23,811
It's amazing what they can do now.

328
00:22:24,536 --> 00:22:26,714
And you'd be such a great dad.

329
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,988
I think you're forgetting
how hard it was for us.

330
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,090
You mean for me.

331
00:22:36,478 --> 00:22:40,727
Well, it took us a long time
to climb out of it.

332
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,030
I know.

333
00:22:43,032 --> 00:22:46,367
And I'm pulling
these 60-hour weeks lately.

334
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:47,368
All right, I-I get it.

335
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:50,070
I just...

336
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:58,244
I'm afraid that if it happened again...

337
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:01,614
I know. I just...

338
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:03,682
I know.

339
00:23:09,256 --> 00:23:12,224
You're gonna be late.

340
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:14,259
Yeah.

341
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,439
Beth here.

342
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,908
Walt, Mack's SUV was found

343
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,209
dumped in a back alley parking lot,

344
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:33,610
suspect not on scene.

345
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:35,580
They bringing it in?

346
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,448
Not anytime soon.

347
00:23:39,782 --> 00:23:41,585
You're not answering your phone.

348
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,386
Kat, I'm sorry, it's been busy.

349
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,088
Do you know where he is, Walt?

350
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,222
Not yet.

351
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:48,325
He's not with me, he's not with you,

352
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,492
although apparently we both have

353
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,227
messages saying otherwise.

354
00:23:51,807 --> 00:23:53,330
Right.

355
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,131
You want to walk with me?

356
00:23:59,837 --> 00:24:01,337
If we sounded the alarm

357
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,737
every time an agent's whereabouts

358
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:04,006
were unknown for a few hours...

359
00:24:04,008 --> 00:24:05,507
What I don't get is the lies.

360
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:06,976
It could be anything
at this point in time.

361
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:09,114
Right now, all we know is
that his SUV has been stolen.

362
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:10,316
Wait. What?

363
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:24,292
I'm at the pick-up spot. Where are you?

364
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:26,827
I'm in an alley one block south.

365
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:28,262
Police are close.

366
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:31,188
All right, I'm coming.

367
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:37,837
Police, west entrance.

368
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,354
Oh, God. Aah!

369
00:24:55,356 --> 00:24:57,956
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

370
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:00,192
I spilled hot coffee on myself.

371
00:25:02,363 --> 00:25:04,997
Oh! Oh, I'm in your way, aren't I?

372
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:06,999
Uh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

373
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:09,534
Um, hang on, hang on.

374
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:43,533
Thanks.

375
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,791
MacLaren.

376
00:26:46,928 --> 00:26:50,395
I got it. All right.

377
00:26:50,397 --> 00:26:52,397
I'll be there.

378
00:26:55,802 --> 00:26:59,571
Oh, good. This takes
forever with one person.

379
00:26:59,573 --> 00:27:01,740
How do corporate clients
always seem to know

380
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:04,510
which materials aren't in stock?

381
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,412
Now?

382
00:27:08,414 --> 00:27:09,580
"All hands on deck."

383
00:27:09,582 --> 00:27:11,516
But I booked those hands in advance.

384
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:12,483
I know.

385
00:27:12,485 --> 00:27:13,842
I'm sorry.

386
00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:16,587
"Sorry."

387
00:27:16,589 --> 00:27:18,256
What do you want me to do?

388
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:19,657
You could not pick up
your phone for once.

389
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:21,325
Yeah, and they could
not give me a paycheck,

390
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:24,494
which only pays for everything we have.

391
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:26,963
You're right.

392
00:27:26,965 --> 00:27:28,498
I should be happy

393
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,700
that I get to spend
any time at all with you

394
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:32,597
and grateful
that I'm so well provided for.

395
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,771
- That is not what I meant.
- Yeah, it is, Grant.

396
00:27:34,773 --> 00:27:35,972
It's exactly what you meant.

397
00:27:35,974 --> 00:27:36,973
- Kat.
- You know what?

398
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:39,108
Just please go to work.

399
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:41,753
What do you ex...

400
00:28:05,943 --> 00:28:08,203
That explains why we lost his GPS.

401
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,039
So, you notice anything out of place?

402
00:28:13,543 --> 00:28:15,141
No.

403
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:17,811
Well, at least there's
no sign of a struggle.

404
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,081
Jesus. I hadn't even considered that.

405
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,684
Sorry, professional reflex.

406
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,919
You know what the weirdest part is?

407
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:28,222
It doesn't feel completely unexpected.

408
00:28:28,224 --> 00:28:29,663
What do you mean?

409
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:33,058
Lately I found myself questioning things

410
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,728
I didn't think
had any mystery left in them,

411
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,848
like my husband.

412
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:41,257
Oh, God, Walt. Maybe I'm losing my mind.

413
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:43,703
No, you're not losing your mind.

414
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:46,205
I've noticed some things myself.

415
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:47,940
Really?

416
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,802
Little things, like all of a sudden,
a much better shot.

417
00:28:51,678 --> 00:28:54,446
He's suddenly much better
at a lot of things.

418
00:28:57,584 --> 00:28:59,183
Yeah...

419
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:01,405
definitely not squash.

420
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,592
Last night, we...

421
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,195
What? What happened?

422
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:15,770
That's the thing. I don't really know.

423
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:19,536
I woke up to a disaster of a kitchen

424
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:22,372
full of empty wine bottles, but...

425
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:24,874
I don't remember attending the party.

426
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,609
I mean, it's not unusual for us

427
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:28,278
to have a glass of wine or two

428
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,649
if he gets home at a decent hour, but...

429
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,649
he sent me a text this morning,

430
00:29:32,651 --> 00:29:35,073
said that I was in rare form.

431
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:36,919
Well, Kat, you can be
pretty entertaining

432
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:38,120
when you've had a few.

433
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:40,289
But I don't remember having anything!

434
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:42,157
I mean...

435
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,893
I woke up this morning
feeling hung over,

436
00:29:44,895 --> 00:29:48,397
but never in my life
have I been blackout drunk,

437
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,506
certainly not
on a Tuesday night at home.

438
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:56,437
It's like my life derailed,
but nothing happened.

439
00:29:56,772 --> 00:30:00,307
Look, maybe you're just stressed.

440
00:30:01,411 --> 00:30:03,110
Let me drive you back to your car.

441
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,879
You sure you don't want
to drive me to the asylum?

442
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:08,215
That is way outta my way.

443
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:18,391
They're looking for me.
I'll get eyes on Forbes.

444
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:20,527
Okay, hold him down.

445
00:30:23,064 --> 00:30:24,230
Okay. Clamps.

446
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,366
Pass me the gauze.

447
00:30:27,502 --> 00:30:29,736
We can't wait. We've gotta do this.

448
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:33,972
Scalpel.

449
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:39,878
It's time.

450
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,112
Time?

451
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:43,065
Come on, old man, you got this.

452
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:46,218
I'm beginning to see
that time is like a river.

453
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,820
You can throw the biggest rock
that you can find

454
00:30:48,822 --> 00:30:50,054
into the river,

455
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,323
but the water just goes around the rock.

456
00:30:52,325 --> 00:30:54,225
It's not optimal, but we have no choice.

457
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,261
...and it continues downstream

458
00:30:57,263 --> 00:30:59,430
as if the rock...

459
00:30:59,432 --> 00:31:01,599
...was never there.

460
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:02,533
Aah!

461
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:03,368
Time to go.

462
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,624
What are you doing?

463
00:31:18,662 --> 00:31:19,928
What does it look like?

464
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,563
No. Just leave it.

465
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:25,767
I don't know how healthy it is
to leave all this stuff out.

466
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:27,302
You weren't sure whether

467
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:28,770
we should set the nursery up
before the baby was born.

468
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:30,405
You gonna throw that in my face too?

469
00:31:30,407 --> 00:31:32,095
No. Come on!

470
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:34,408
Just leave it.

471
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:35,742
I want to deal with it.

472
00:31:35,744 --> 00:31:36,763
You should be resting.

473
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:38,521
Oh, God, I am sick of resting.

474
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:40,614
I'm just putting
some stuff away for now.

475
00:31:40,616 --> 00:31:42,938
- If you want to help...
- Why?

476
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:46,553
Aren't we going to try again?

477
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,197
Was that it?

478
00:31:51,363 --> 00:31:52,295
It's over?

479
00:31:53,888 --> 00:31:56,022
Every time you pass this room,

480
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:58,264
you stand in the doorway and you stare.

481
00:31:58,266 --> 00:31:59,876
Yeah, I did that before.

482
00:31:59,891 --> 00:32:02,258
Well, I think maybe
it meant something different

483
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,604
before you lost the baby.

484
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:06,762
No, before we lost the baby.

485
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:09,397
This isn't just something
that happened to me.

486
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:13,235
You're absolutely right about that.

487
00:32:14,404 --> 00:32:16,038
Because I almost lost you.

488
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:22,077
I spent a whole day and night
in a hospital room alone

489
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:24,879
waiting to see whether or not
you were going to make it.

490
00:32:25,982 --> 00:32:27,982
I was sad we lost the baby,

491
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:31,252
but just the thought of losing you

492
00:32:31,254 --> 00:32:32,753
was so much worse.

493
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:38,459
And I'm sorry if that makes me
a selfish asshole, but...

494
00:32:39,795 --> 00:32:41,262
Yeah.

495
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:44,231
I'm putting a few things away.

496
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:19,130
It's not like
we haven't heard from him today.

497
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:21,099
If even you don't know where he is...

498
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:22,566
We don't keep tabs on each other.

499
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:24,168
He doesn't know where I am
half the time either.

500
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,203
His vehicle was stolen,

501
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:26,971
and he's not answering the phone.

502
00:33:26,973 --> 00:33:28,639
We will figure it out, Kat, okay?

503
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:31,276
I will tell you the minute
that we hear anything.

504
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:33,343
All right?

505
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:34,811
- Thanks, Walt.
- No problem.

506
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:40,050
Forbes.

507
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,151
Yeah, hi. It's Beth.

508
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:44,388
- Go ahead.
- I, uh, I found something on Mac.

509
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,488
You're gonna want to see this.

510
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,190
Okay, I'm on my way up.

511
00:34:12,782 --> 00:34:14,149
Kathryn?

512
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,216
Yes.

513
00:34:16,597 --> 00:34:17,596
And no.

514
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,023
Do you understand?

515
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,861
These aren't my memories.

516
00:34:27,863 --> 00:34:29,763
No.

517
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:32,599
I'm not Grant MacLaren.

518
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,335
No.

519
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:36,603
And yes.

520
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:39,906
These were his memories.

521
00:34:39,908 --> 00:34:44,444
Only the brightest shards...
fragmented and incoherent.

522
00:34:44,446 --> 00:34:45,945
Orphaned neurons

523
00:34:45,947 --> 00:34:48,514
of your host's mind cut off from you.

524
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:50,883
Normally, you never
would have had access to them.

525
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:52,352
Why now?

526
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:56,589
You're very near death.

527
00:34:58,425 --> 00:35:00,592
I can feel it.

528
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:01,860
We're trying to save you.

529
00:35:01,862 --> 00:35:03,862
Tens of thousands of nanites

530
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:05,430
working in concert

531
00:35:05,432 --> 00:35:07,565
to repair damage
to your prefrontal cortex

532
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:09,501
and throughout the rest of your body.

533
00:35:09,503 --> 00:35:12,637
Your consciousness
was given access to these memories

534
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:13,738
as a refuge.

535
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:16,607
Show me more.

536
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:18,426
There are no more.

537
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:21,278
Those were the last remnants of him.

538
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,718
I loved you so much.

539
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:29,568
He did.

540
00:35:29,755 --> 00:35:33,123
They're his memories, not yours.

541
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:37,127
So why can't I tell the difference?

542
00:35:45,171 --> 00:35:47,337
Cross-clamping the aorta.

543
00:35:47,605 --> 00:35:49,638
Okay. Here we go. Scalpel.

544
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,316
Tissue is presenting normally,
but it's fibrillating.

545
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,325
Let's get it in and get it charged.

546
00:36:19,702 --> 00:36:21,469
Hey. Check your email.

547
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,537
What'd you find?

548
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:23,636
Mac's GPS data.

549
00:36:23,638 --> 00:36:25,138
Uploaded to the cloud.

550
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,540
Everywhere MacLaren's SUV

551
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:29,005
has been in the past month and a half.

552
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:32,312
I marked a few places of interest.

553
00:36:32,314 --> 00:36:33,513
This is great.

554
00:36:33,515 --> 00:36:34,981
I pulled Philip Pearson's file.

555
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:37,067
Saw his lawyer is Ray Green.

556
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:39,738
Why am I not surprised?

557
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,020
Guess who bought an old garage
up near the tracks

558
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:43,522
the day after his client
won the lottery?

559
00:36:44,344 --> 00:36:46,725
MacLaren's been there a bunch of times.

560
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:49,562
There you go.

561
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:50,729
Oh, shit.

562
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:52,331
- I'll get started on a warrant.
- Shit!

563
00:36:54,202 --> 00:36:55,501
We have to move!

564
00:36:55,503 --> 00:36:57,135
What?

565
00:36:57,137 --> 00:36:59,003
MacLaren's partner is coming.

566
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:01,038
Do you know what
they're doing to him in there?

567
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:01,973
The mission comes first.

568
00:37:01,975 --> 00:37:02,927
Stop him.

569
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,676
I can hack into the system,
slow him down with the warrant,

570
00:37:05,678 --> 00:37:08,580
stall him for a couple hours, maybe,

571
00:37:08,582 --> 00:37:10,181
but eventually, he will be coming!

572
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:16,820
Why these memories?

573
00:37:16,822 --> 00:37:18,888
They could be random...

574
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,024
or these memories were so strong

575
00:37:21,026 --> 00:37:22,493
they survived your arrival.

576
00:37:26,898 --> 00:37:28,265
What's happening?

577
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:29,933
It's time to go.

578
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,900
Go where?

579
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:33,336
We'll see.

580
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,840
Are you coming?

581
00:37:37,842 --> 00:37:39,342
No.

582
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:42,778
And yes.

583
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:50,152
- He's not responding!
- Charge again.

584
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:53,308
Clear!

585
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:57,350
- Again!
- Charge!

586
00:37:57,905 --> 00:37:59,096
Clear!

587
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,757
You've reached
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

588
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:13,292
Please leave a message.

589
00:38:14,462 --> 00:38:16,962
Jesus, Mac.

590
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,186
Hello?

591
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:11,660
Can I help you?

592
00:39:11,662 --> 00:39:13,995
I'm looking for Philip Pearson.

593
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,496
Uh... Who?

594
00:39:16,498 --> 00:39:18,177
Pearson. I know he's here.

595
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:19,746
And you are?

596
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:22,008
Special Agent Forbes.

597
00:39:22,752 --> 00:39:23,920
FBI.

598
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:28,189
Well, in that case,
I'm gonna need to see a warrant.

599
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,491
Tell me again
why I shouldn't take you in.

600
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,026
You know why. I'm a hacker.

601
00:39:33,028 --> 00:39:34,127
How am I gonna do that from jail?

602
00:39:34,129 --> 00:39:35,358
Mac?

603
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,523
Now look what you've done.

604
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,800
W-What's going on?

605
00:39:40,802 --> 00:39:42,635
Someone needs to be reminded

606
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:45,906
of the dynamics of
our working relationship.

607
00:39:45,908 --> 00:39:47,540
W... You're working with this kid?

608
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:49,243
No, no, no. He's working for me.

609
00:39:49,245 --> 00:39:52,411
A distinction that seems
to have slipped his mind.

610
00:39:52,413 --> 00:39:54,813
I was just trying to show you
how vulnerable you are.

611
00:39:54,815 --> 00:39:56,249
You shut up.

612
00:39:56,251 --> 00:39:57,649
Mr. Pearson is one

613
00:39:57,651 --> 00:39:59,085
of my confidential informants

614
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:01,687
on the hacking case I was working.

615
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:03,639
I promised to keep him out of the system

616
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:06,259
if he promised to stop breaking the law.

617
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:08,360
Did I or did I not prove to you

618
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:09,560
that I could steal your car?

619
00:40:09,562 --> 00:40:10,862
You don't even have a license.

620
00:40:10,864 --> 00:40:12,230
I can make one of those too.

621
00:40:12,232 --> 00:40:14,565
He claims that if he could hack my life,

622
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:15,591
bad guys could too.

623
00:40:15,593 --> 00:40:17,868
I'm telling you, man,
you guys are not secure.

624
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:19,503
Yeah, all right, that's enough.

625
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:21,739
Hey, thanks for the tip on my car, Walt.

626
00:40:21,741 --> 00:40:23,441
Wasn't hard to figure out who did it.

627
00:40:23,443 --> 00:40:25,175
Why didn't you call me back?

628
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:26,410
You didn't get my texts?

629
00:40:26,412 --> 00:40:27,480
No, I didn't get them.

630
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:29,126
I texted you, like, three times.

631
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:32,182
Uh, sorry, guys.

632
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:35,386
He didn't get them.
They were redirected.

633
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:37,587
I was proving a point.

634
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:39,689
I'm gonna need to call off the cavalry.

635
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:41,231
Everyone's out there looking for you.

636
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:42,164
What?

637
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,853
You went offline
and your car was stolen.

638
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:45,876
Aw, Jesus. Are you listening to this?

639
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:47,344
I did you a favor.

640
00:40:47,346 --> 00:40:48,879
How do you people not see that?

641
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:50,681
Your security is shit!

642
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,649
You're probably vulnerable too.

643
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:54,251
My fee is extremely reasonable.

644
00:40:54,253 --> 00:40:55,686
If you weren't his C.I...

645
00:40:55,688 --> 00:40:57,088
- Aah!
- Shh, shh.

646
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,688
I'm sorry.
I had no idea he was doing this.

647
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,573
Look, it's not like I don't
have anything better to do

648
00:41:00,575 --> 00:41:01,967
than chase your ass all over town.

649
00:41:01,969 --> 00:41:03,366
I'll make it up to you.

650
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:07,030
It's not me
that you have to worry about.

651
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,898
Call your wife.

652
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:16,004
Uh... Walt!

653
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,617
Your fee is extremely reasonable?

654
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,052
I was improvising!

655
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,519
But I think we pulled it off.

656
00:41:31,521 --> 00:41:32,553
I thought I was gonna pass out.

657
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:33,788
We've had enough of that for one day.

658
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:35,056
The nanites still have
a few hours' work.

659
00:41:35,058 --> 00:41:36,891
You have no business being on your feet.

660
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,127
So I should take a sick day,
is that what you're saying?

661
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,128
I'm saying

662
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,528
if you want to avoid external scarring,

663
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:44,031
you have rest for
at least two more hours,

664
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:47,068
and no sexual activity
for the next 36 hours,

665
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,497
until the nanites have left your system.

666
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:53,140
Well, I'll try to restrain myself.

667
00:41:56,979 --> 00:41:58,245
Thank you.

668
00:41:58,247 --> 00:41:59,312
It was our pleasure.

669
00:41:59,314 --> 00:42:00,380
How about hooking me up

670
00:42:00,382 --> 00:42:02,282
with some of that sweet nano tech?

671
00:42:02,284 --> 00:42:03,449
Nanites are by directive only.

672
00:42:03,451 --> 00:42:04,617
Sorry.

673
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:05,752
I've got school tomorrow, Derek!

674
00:42:05,754 --> 00:42:06,752
Lucky you.

675
00:42:06,754 --> 00:42:08,287
We have to fly across the world

676
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:10,622
to save the life of
a genocidal dictator.

677
00:42:10,624 --> 00:42:11,924
Why would you do that?

678
00:42:11,926 --> 00:42:14,660
Presumably he's better
than the alternative.

679
00:42:17,098 --> 00:42:19,731
It was a pleasure
working with you, 3569.

680
00:42:19,733 --> 00:42:21,167
Same here.

681
00:42:21,169 --> 00:42:22,467
Get some rest.

682
00:42:22,469 --> 00:42:23,835
And I wanted you to know

683
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:25,904
if there was anything
we could do for you...

684
00:42:25,906 --> 00:42:28,006
It's... It's all right.

685
00:42:28,008 --> 00:42:29,740
I understand.

686
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:32,443
Take care of yourselves.

687
00:42:49,461 --> 00:42:50,961
Kat?

688
00:42:54,266 --> 00:42:55,857
Hello?

689
00:42:59,003 --> 00:43:01,170
Kat?

690
00:43:02,506 --> 00:43:04,340
You home?

691
00:43:11,615 --> 00:43:12,548
There you are.

692
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,982
I tried your cell phone.

693
00:43:13,984 --> 00:43:15,516
I turned it off.

694
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:17,018
Now you know how it feels.

695
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,220
I know, I'm sorry.

696
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:19,888
I couldn't stop myself from checking it

697
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,649
to see if you were alive or dead,

698
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:24,226
and it was making me
crazy, so I shut it off,

699
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:26,591
and then I found myself
enjoying the feeling,

700
00:43:26,616 --> 00:43:27,816
so I kept it off.

701
00:43:27,818 --> 00:43:30,084
Well, it's actually a funny story.

702
00:43:30,086 --> 00:43:32,668
My C.I. stole my car.

703
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,254
- He hacked into my phone...
- You know what?

704
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:35,202
You can tell me tomorrow.

705
00:43:35,204 --> 00:43:36,669
I am sure it's an interesting story,

706
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:40,286
but right now I'm tired,
and I want to have a bath.

707
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:45,065
If you need me to wash your back, or...
