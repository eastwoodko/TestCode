1
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:14,390
Agent MacLaren never did
explain before they left how my...

2
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:17,268
teapot got smashed.
I don't suppose you...

3
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:20,271
Yeah. Doesn't matter.

4
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,231
I just dipped the bags in the cups.

5
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:23,482
Careful, that's hot.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,651
What is this?

7
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:27,945
Really?

8
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,199
Wow. It's, uh... It's tea.

9
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:34,243
He said you wouldn't remember the events
of the last few months, but I...

10
00:00:34,327 --> 00:00:35,869
didn't expect that.

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,876
It's good. I like it.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,962
Yeah, I know you do.

13
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:46,885
Blow on it, though, so you don't...

14
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:48,503
burn your tongue.

15
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,429
So this experimental procedure
that they gave you...

16
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,514
uh, what was that all about?

17
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:58,892
- Did it hurt?
- I... I can't tell you that.

18
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:01,104
Because you don't remember.

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,481
I don't, actually,

20
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,566
but that's not why I can't tell you.

21
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,301
Because it's a secret.

22
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,986
That part you remember.

23
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,906
All right, you know, it doesn't matter.
It worked.

24
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,701
And to be honest, Marcy, I'm just...

25
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,496
I can't tell you how relieved I am.

26
00:01:19,622 --> 00:01:20,831
Why can't you tell me?

27
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,460
Oh...

28
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,961
Well, I can.

29
00:01:28,214 --> 00:01:29,715
What did MacLaren tell you about me?

30
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,593
Uh, everything.

31
00:01:32,676 --> 00:01:36,430
That you knew me on a professional level
while I was undercover,

32
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:39,933
but that we were friends now.
I've been staying here temporarily.

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,744
And that's it?

34
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:45,631
There wasn't really that much time
to brief me before you came home.

35
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,560
Yeah. No. I just...

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,279
Yeah.

37
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,741
He said the most important thing
was that we were close.

38
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,494
And that I can trust you.

39
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,645
When I was in college,

40
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,086
I learned all about amnesia
in one of my courses.

41
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,551
I don't remember which course,
ironically...

42
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,763
but I do remember learning
that in a lot of cases,

43
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,265
memories come back.

44
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,104
That's what I'm hoping for.

45
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,819
Charlotte, what's wrong?
Did you have a bad dream?

46
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,578
It's all right. Your mom's here.

47
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:26,912
Charlotte?

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,175
Charlotte?
Is everything all right in there?

49
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,610
No.

50
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,105
You should come in.

51
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,499
What are you doing here?

52
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,793
Hi. Thought we could, uh...

53
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,782
work out together, and then...
go somewhere for breakfast.

54
00:04:16,198 --> 00:04:19,158
No, Grant. I mean,
what are you doing here?

55
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,858
What do you mean? I wanted to see you.
What's wrong with that?

56
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,935
I'm not doing this here.

57
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,562
Doing what?

58
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,855
Step off that thing for a second.
Come on, let's... let's talk.

59
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,941
Oh, now you want to talk?

60
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,776
What happened? Did she break it off?

61
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,153
- What? Who?
- Don't insult me.

62
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,355
What's her name?

63
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,326
You want to do this here? Fine.

64
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,238
What's her name, Grant?

65
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,913
You want to talk,
let's start the conversation with that.

66
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,042
How did you know?

67
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:03,011
I didn't, really, not for sure,
but I guess I do now.

68
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,579
Kat, I...

69
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,808
If you want to know when,
it was the last time we had sex,

70
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,643
after your surprise party.

71
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,396
At the time, all I could think of was,

72
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,316
"Wow, where the hell
did he learn how to do that?"

73
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:18,986
Then afterwards, I realized
there was obviously only one explanation.

74
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,865
It was like you were making love
to a different person.

75
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,199
You were a different person.

76
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,202
- How do you think that made me feel?
- In a way, I was.

77
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,914
All I can tell you is that I'm here now.

78
00:05:32,453 --> 00:05:33,830
And I wanna stay.

79
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,713
I'm not sure I want you to.

80
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,882
David?

81
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:56,008
Yes?

82
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:59,387
- Oh... hey.
- What are these from?

83
00:06:00,304 --> 00:06:03,140
Uh... what am I looking at?

84
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:05,183
These scars on my chest and my neck.

85
00:06:05,268 --> 00:06:06,477
These wounds are fresh,

86
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,061
and it looks like
it was done by a scalpel.

87
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:09,605
Right. Yeah.

88
00:06:09,688 --> 00:06:11,607
You, uh...

89
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:14,109
You performed minor surgery on yourself,

90
00:06:14,192 --> 00:06:18,281
installed something called
a vagus nerve stimulator,

91
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:20,032
supposed to help
with the seizures you were having.

92
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:21,909
Uh, by myself?

93
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:23,327
Why would I do that?

94
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,203
Yeah. That's what I said.

95
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:30,876
VNS therapy would have never worked
in the case of pre-existing damage.

96
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,879
Yeah, that's what you said. Right after.

97
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:35,714
I was apoplectic.

98
00:06:35,798 --> 00:06:37,925
There was blood everywhere.

99
00:06:38,008 --> 00:06:39,927
Obviously, I took it out.

100
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,429
The only thing that seemed to help,

101
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:44,031
or at least bought you time,
was the, uh...

102
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:46,055
lumbar punctures.

103
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,646
You made some sort of serum
out of the fluid.

104
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:53,148
I couldn't have done that by myself.

105
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:54,442
You didn't.

106
00:06:55,526 --> 00:06:56,846
I helped.

107
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,406
Do you mind if I have some coffee
before we continue this conversation?

108
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:03,283
Do you have any medical training?

109
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,619
Nope. You taught me.

110
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:07,532
Do you remember coffee? Do you...

111
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,540
Do you want some coffee?

112
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,795
If those treatments
really did buy me time, then...

113
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,507
I owe you my life.

114
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,676
No. You don't owe me anything.

115
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:24,347
You could do me a favor, though.
You could... You could...

116
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:28,976
You could do up one or...
two of those buttons

117
00:07:29,059 --> 00:07:31,061
on that shirt that I laid out
for today, which, that...

118
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:32,229
I mean, that's fine.

119
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:34,231
Is it bothering you?

120
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:36,817
Bother's the wrong word.

121
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,681
Better?

122
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:42,114
I don't know.

123
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:49,455
David... were we intimate?

124
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,418
See, the thing about that is...

125
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:56,379
you'd only have my word to go by,

126
00:07:56,462 --> 00:07:59,458
which forces my inner boy scout
to not take advantage.

127
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:12,520
If that was a test, that wasn't fair,
'cause I wasn't ready.

128
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:15,439
That was to thank you for helping me.

129
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:19,735
I thought maybe you remembered something.

130
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:24,114
Oh, there... there is one thing.

131
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,049
What? What is it?

132
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:28,201
That you're a reporter.

133
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,459
A social worker.

134
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,672
- But that's okay.
- We'll work on it.

135
00:08:47,095 --> 00:08:48,138
I'm here.

136
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:49,390
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

137
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:51,016
<i>- I need your help.</i>
- What is it?

138
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:52,309
<i>It's Jeff. He's...</i>

139
00:08:52,393 --> 00:08:54,728
I've left you messages about this.

140
00:08:54,812 --> 00:08:56,772
He's got me backed into a corner.

141
00:08:56,855 --> 00:08:58,273
He wants custody of my son.

142
00:08:58,356 --> 00:09:00,568
- Your son?
<i>- Yes.</i>

143
00:09:00,651 --> 00:09:02,903
What do you want me to do about it?

144
00:09:02,928 --> 00:09:03,987
Talk to him. With...

145
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:06,782
with your position at the FBI,
you can... You can help...

146
00:09:06,865 --> 00:09:09,535
I spoke to Jeff, Carly.
Or rather, he spoke to me.

147
00:09:09,618 --> 00:09:11,286
- At work.
<i>- He did?</i>

148
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:13,371
God, I want to bury that man.

149
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:15,541
<i>You need to get this situation
under control.</i>

150
00:09:15,624 --> 00:09:16,750
That's why I need your help.

151
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:19,336
Does Trevor call me every time
he's got trouble with his parents?

152
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,783
No, but you don't sleep with Trevor,
do you?

153
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:28,637
Fight your own battles, Carly,
just like the rest of us.

154
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:34,602
And then Rene said that all my pictures

155
00:09:34,685 --> 00:09:37,646
should have hashtag,
boob job won't fix this on them.

156
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,161
So... you didn't retaliate?

157
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:41,650
What?

158
00:09:41,734 --> 00:09:45,403
This is your problem exactly.
You let people walk all over you.

159
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:47,322
You need to establish dominance.

160
00:09:47,405 --> 00:09:50,573
Next time Rene says something to you,
disparage her home life.

161
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,077
Her mother's had a DUI.

162
00:09:52,953 --> 00:09:55,019
Alternatively,
you can just accept the fact

163
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:56,844
that you're less attractive
and uninteresting.

164
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,487
That option may even be more realistic.

165
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,666
Uh... I'm gonna go...

166
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,761
Good talk.

167
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,020
Um, Ms. Day, can I talk to you
for a minute?

168
00:10:18,103 --> 00:10:20,355
Let's not pretend I have a choice.
What is it?

169
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:23,441
Um, I have some forms for a field trip
I need your signature on.

170
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:24,735
Shouldn't your parents fill those out?

171
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:27,323
They're dead.

172
00:10:27,373 --> 00:10:28,499
What?

173
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:31,158
Jesus.

174
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:53,471
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

175
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:57,017
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!
Hey! What are you doing?

176
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:03,273
- She tried to kill me!
- I can tell!

177
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:07,277
Let me go! I'm on a mission!

178
00:11:14,534 --> 00:11:16,908
- Go after her!
- And do what? She's a kid!

179
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:19,401
- A kid who tried to stab me to death!
- Why? What'd you do?

180
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:21,600
What did I do?
There's something more going on here.

181
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,294
- What?
- I can't stay here. She'll be back.

182
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:26,004
- I have to get to Ellis.
- No, no!

183
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:27,631
You're not going anywhere just yet.

184
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:29,948
Guys, it's Trevor.
We have to meet up at ops.

185
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:31,719
A traveler just tried to kill Grace.

186
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,393
Sorry.
I had a hard time finding the place.

187
00:11:40,477 --> 00:11:41,770
I should have picked you up.

188
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:44,022
It's fine. I'm here now.

189
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,330
Not a single SOS that I can see.

190
00:11:46,942 --> 00:11:48,792
Maybe she was just targeting you.

191
00:11:48,817 --> 00:11:50,092
Of course she was targeting me.

192
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:52,405
Are you sure it wasn't just a student
with a bone to pick?

193
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:53,866
No, I was there.

194
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:56,827
You remember the family
who had their historian misfire?

195
00:11:57,215 --> 00:11:58,675
I'm pretty sure it was the daughter.

196
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:01,081
The girl I took to her grandma's house?

197
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,292
Don't look at me.

198
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:04,309
Charlotte.

199
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:06,255
She said she was on a mission.

200
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,756
She was taken as a host anyway.

201
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,508
Why would the director want you dead?

202
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,301
The director didn't send her.

203
00:12:13,385 --> 00:12:15,345
I've already told you,
there's a faction in the future...

204
00:12:15,428 --> 00:12:18,431
No one but the director
has the capability to send travelers.

205
00:12:19,307 --> 00:12:20,600
Tell them what you did.

206
00:12:21,805 --> 00:12:23,436
Tell them! Or I will.

207
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,021
I reset the director.

208
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,047
What?

209
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:34,081
Rebooted its OS through a virus

210
00:12:34,106 --> 00:12:36,867
in order to protect it
from corruption by the faction.

211
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,995
What would they say in the 21st? Uh...

212
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:42,706
"Control, alt, delete."

213
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,624
That's impossible.

214
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,961
Well, the director is a highly advanced
quantum AI program

215
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:51,298
and I'm the lead programmer,
so, no, not impossible.

216
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:55,010
You reset an AI that's been running
every facet of our lives

217
00:12:55,093 --> 00:12:58,471
since long before I was born,
and not to mention every mission...

218
00:12:58,555 --> 00:12:59,973
Before you were born, maybe.

219
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:02,600
But not me. I helped create it.

220
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:04,644
- No one else could've done it.
- How?

221
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,393
She uploaded a command
while pretending to save Marcy's life.

222
00:13:11,343 --> 00:13:12,344
How?

223
00:13:12,861 --> 00:13:16,489
When she saw my code,
it was sent back as visual information

224
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:19,910
through the quantum bridge created
during transfer of consciousness.

225
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:21,704
You mean you used me?

226
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:24,915
I saved you,
and I'm saving the director.

227
00:13:24,998 --> 00:13:28,001
Where is the gratitude?
What is wrong with you people?

228
00:13:28,085 --> 00:13:29,712
What's happening in the future
while it's offline?

229
00:13:29,795 --> 00:13:31,629
Chaos, probably.

230
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:34,299
A temporary power struggle.

231
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,721
The faction doesn't believe
in the grand plan.

232
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:42,099
Even before Helios had basically
no effect on the future,

233
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:44,476
they had already started a mission
to abandon ship.

234
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,562
Your team knows firsthand
the brutality they're capable of.

235
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:50,774
You mean they're the ones
who put us in those cages?

236
00:13:51,566 --> 00:13:52,735
Tortured us?

237
00:13:52,818 --> 00:13:55,332
To test your loyalty... and to make sure

238
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:57,320
you couldn't complete a mission
they disagreed with.

239
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,658
That was the first real proof I had

240
00:14:00,743 --> 00:14:03,495
that they'd managed to implement
some of their agenda.

241
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:07,707
So I came back here
into the 21st to stop them.

242
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:11,169
What do we do now?

243
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:13,964
The director will come back online
more secure than ever,

244
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:16,341
and soon,
everything will go back to normal.

245
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:19,595
"Thank you for saving us, Grace."

246
00:14:27,144 --> 00:14:28,771
Please take me to Ellis...

247
00:14:28,854 --> 00:14:31,523
before one of you gets overwritten
and tries to kill me.

248
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:33,441
What makes you think
you'll be safe there?

249
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,443
He's taken precautions.

250
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,371
Boss?

251
00:14:41,574 --> 00:14:42,993
Yeah, get her outta here.

252
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,413
But don't let her out of your sight.

253
00:14:54,587 --> 00:14:56,799
"Thank you for saving us, Grace!"

254
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,275
Is this yours?

255
00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:01,113
Uh...

256
00:16:02,447 --> 00:16:03,781
Yeah.

257
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:06,576
I inherited it from my host.

258
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:08,871
Historical record was wrong.

259
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:11,832
You know, we should spend
some more time debriefing you.

260
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,613
- There are a lot of...
- What?

261
00:16:13,876 --> 00:16:15,836
You just kept taking it?

262
00:16:16,268 --> 00:16:19,339
You were helping me wean off it,
but I had a little bit of a setback.

263
00:16:19,422 --> 00:16:22,175
Well, we're starting again.
No more than eight units.

264
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,511
If you take more than that,
it's because you want it.

265
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:25,720
And I won't stand for that.

266
00:16:25,803 --> 00:16:27,228
And from now on...

267
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,682
I'm keeping track of how much you dose.

268
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:32,310
You're the doctor.

269
00:16:32,394 --> 00:16:34,121
And you're the historian.

270
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,382
We need your mind clear.

271
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:53,331
Ellis!

272
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:55,876
Ellis!

273
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:05,052
Ellis!

274
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,638
- Where is he?
- Not here.

275
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:23,611
So you are gonna be hanging
with the babysitter today.

276
00:17:23,695 --> 00:17:24,737
Huh?

277
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:35,832
Just gonna hang tight, little man,

278
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:39,086
and I'll come back and get you
after work, okay?

279
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:40,295
Hmm?

280
00:17:40,378 --> 00:17:44,049
You wanna fly? You wanna fly?

281
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:45,758
Hey, it's okay.

282
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:47,802
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

283
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,471
Hey, guys.

284
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:29,844
You okay?

285
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:32,847
Are you...

286
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,767
- okay?
- I'm fine.

287
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:40,230
I had no choice.
She was gonna shoot you.

288
00:18:41,439 --> 00:18:43,400
- Yeah, she was.
- You saw that, right?

289
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:47,112
Carly, what the fuck are you doin'?

290
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:49,281
Carly! You need to stay put!

291
00:18:49,364 --> 00:18:51,908
Carly!

292
00:19:19,227 --> 00:19:21,646
Where the hell were you?
It's dangerous out there!

293
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:24,024
I had to run out for a few supplies.

294
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:34,701
What do you want now?

295
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:37,995
The faction sent an assassin after me.

296
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,539
Not a very good one, apparently.

297
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:42,125
Oh, fortunately,
I was there to stop her.

298
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:44,461
- Where?
- At the school.

299
00:19:44,544 --> 00:19:46,213
Any of 'em follow you?

300
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:49,350
We're alone.
You can stop worrying about yourself.

301
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:54,679
Were you a part of the reset, too?

302
00:19:54,762 --> 00:19:56,598
- Reset?
- Of the director?

303
00:19:58,015 --> 00:19:59,934
- That is too far.
- It was the only way.

304
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:01,519
Not by a long shot!

305
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,771
My God, the ego of this woman.

306
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:06,983
When?

307
00:20:07,984 --> 00:20:09,944
When I sat Marcy down at your computer.

308
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:12,029
Right in front of me.

309
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:16,710
- Give me a hand with this.
- What is all this?

310
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:23,083
Are these SQUID transistors?

311
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,961
You think you're the only one who
figured out what the faction is up to?

312
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,421
Look, have a little faith.

313
00:20:28,505 --> 00:20:30,882
The director had its own contingency,

314
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:33,050
although you've probably screwed
that all up.

315
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:34,344
Wait, what contingency?

316
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:39,115
Me... and this.

317
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:54,447
I was sent back to assemble this.

318
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,129
The director's had teams working
on core elements for months.

319
00:21:10,046 --> 00:21:12,507
First components arrived
the day I came back to the 21st.

320
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,457
- This is a quantum frame.
- Yes, it is.

321
00:21:16,052 --> 00:21:18,138
If things get bad enough
that the director has no choice

322
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:21,891
but to escape the faction,
it can send itself here to the 21st.

323
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:37,282
Agent MacLaren.

324
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:39,867
Officer Boyd. How can I help...

325
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:42,287
Jesus, what are you doing?

326
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,038
- What'd you do?
- What?

327
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:46,749
What did you do that would make
the director give an order to kill you?

328
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,793
How did you receive the order?

329
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:50,920
By messenger. Don't change the subject.

330
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:52,088
What did you do?

331
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:55,007
I think you already know
I didn't do anything wrong,

332
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,968
or we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

333
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:59,053
Your orders didn't come
from the director.

334
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:01,598
- What does that mean?
- What was the message exactly?

335
00:22:01,681 --> 00:22:04,767
"Kill 3468," so not a lot of room
for interpretation.

336
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:08,313
Another traveler I know had an attempt
made on her life earlier today.

337
00:22:08,396 --> 00:22:09,772
By who, if not the director?

338
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:12,567
According to her,
another faction from the future.

339
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,236
I don't know about any faction.

340
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,653
Well, neither do I...

341
00:22:15,737 --> 00:22:17,905
but apparently,
things have changed since we left,

342
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:19,199
and not for the better.

343
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:21,409
That's not good enough.

344
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:22,910
It's all I got.

345
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:25,037
I only know what she told me.

346
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,250
That's a problem.

347
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,545
It doesn't have to be.

348
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,951
- Does it?
- Yeah.

349
00:22:36,368 --> 00:22:38,078
It does.

350
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:41,388
Take a step back.

351
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:45,224
Take a step back, MacLaren!

352
00:23:28,643 --> 00:23:29,936
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Marce.</i>

353
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:30,853
David?

354
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:33,523
I'm glad you recognize my voice.

355
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:35,650
So here's something awkward...

356
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:38,110
There's a man in my apartment
who's looking for you,

357
00:23:38,194 --> 00:23:40,079
and he has a gun.

358
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:41,781
Has he hurt you?

359
00:23:41,864 --> 00:23:43,533
<i>Uh... little bit.</i>

360
00:23:44,326 --> 00:23:47,412
<i>A little bit,
but he said he'd do a lot more</i>

361
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:49,456
if I didn't phone you right away.

362
00:23:49,539 --> 00:23:51,290
He did point the gun nozzle...

363
00:23:53,376 --> 00:23:56,838
You know, I know it's not "nozzle,"
but I can't think of the word right now.

364
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:58,423
I wanna say barrel?

365
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:01,634
You know, it's not coming to me,

366
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:03,302
but he's got it pointed
at the back of my head

367
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:05,491
<i>right now, so if you can imagine that...</i>

368
00:24:06,473 --> 00:24:08,766
that's what's happening,
and that's why I'm calling you.

369
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,101
Against my will.

370
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:21,488
Kat.

371
00:24:21,571 --> 00:24:22,697
Grant? What are you doing here?

372
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,741
Sorry to just show up like this,
but it's important.

373
00:24:24,824 --> 00:24:27,744
- How did you find me?
- I'm FBI.

374
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:30,372
And I need you to go home right now,
pack a bag,

375
00:24:30,455 --> 00:24:32,289
go to your mother's for a few days,
maybe a week.

376
00:24:32,374 --> 00:24:33,625
What? What's going on?

377
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,835
- I'm dealing with a situation at work.
- Work?

378
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:38,295
- It's not safe.
- Tell me what's happening.

379
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,047
- I can't.
- Are you safe?

380
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:42,759
Look, I know it's not
the ideal time for me

381
00:24:42,842 --> 00:24:46,596
to make demands of you,
but I need you to do as I ask.

382
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,681
If something happened to you
because of me...

383
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:51,142
I don't know what I'd do.

384
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:53,895
- You're serious.
- Yes.

385
00:24:53,978 --> 00:24:56,898
All right, don't worry about me.
I'll go right now.

386
00:24:56,981 --> 00:24:59,025
Just tell me that
you're gonna be all right.

387
00:25:00,902 --> 00:25:02,612
I'll walk you to your car.

388
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:04,947
Come on.

389
00:25:06,115 --> 00:25:09,452
Carly, where the hell are you?

390
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:10,953
I am in some serious shit.

391
00:25:11,037 --> 00:25:13,372
I need you to meet me down at the station
and help me.

392
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:16,333
You were the only witness

393
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:19,378
that saw that I killed that girl
to save you!

394
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:23,257
You just can't run off
to leave me to deal with this!

395
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:25,760
Call me back.

396
00:26:01,215 --> 00:26:02,675
- Yes?
- Excuse me.

397
00:26:02,758 --> 00:26:04,510
- I'm here about your east wall.
- What?

398
00:26:04,594 --> 00:26:06,178
The building manager notified you, yes?

399
00:26:06,261 --> 00:26:08,973
I just need your cooperation
for a couple minutes, okay?

400
00:26:09,056 --> 00:26:10,891
- Building manager?
- Yeah. He should have contacted you.

401
00:26:10,975 --> 00:26:12,226
I just need you to step aside
for a moment,

402
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,770
and I will be
out of your way soon, okay?

403
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:35,082
Hello?

404
00:26:43,716 --> 00:26:46,594
Answer it.

405
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,225
- Hey, Marce?
- Duck.

406
00:26:53,308 --> 00:26:55,352
- What?
- Duck down now.

407
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:05,738
Oh, God.

408
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:11,326
Oh, God.

409
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,415
Marce?

410
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,418
Marcy? You shot him.

411
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:22,713
What did you expect me to do?
He was gonna kill you right after me.

412
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:26,285
I need you to go somewhere else
for a couple nights, until it's safe.

413
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:27,384
Okay?

414
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,075
Go somewhere?

415
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:33,128
Marcy, there's a dead guy
on my living room floor!

416
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:35,768
I gotta call the police.

417
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:38,843
If you insist on bringing them
into this...

418
00:27:38,926 --> 00:27:41,553
I need you to tell them that
you don't know where the shot came from.

419
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:44,849
- You want me to lie?
- No, David.

420
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:46,516
I want you to go somewhere safe,

421
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,311
but if you're gonna bring the police
into this then, yes, lie.

422
00:27:51,897 --> 00:27:53,273
We'll have to cover this up later.

423
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:54,734
I need to go.

424
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:57,424
Marcy?

425
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,285
<i>Hello. You've reached
the confidential voicemail</i>

426
00:28:05,369 --> 00:28:06,746
<i>of Special Agent Forbes.</i>

427
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:09,456
<i>Please leave a detailed message,
and I'll get back to you.</i>

428
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:13,753
Hey, Walt, it's Kat again.

429
00:28:13,836 --> 00:28:16,881
I'm sorry to keep calling,
but I really need to talk to you.

430
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:18,848
What's going on? I'm worried.

431
00:28:19,424 --> 00:28:20,843
Please call me back.

432
00:28:23,804 --> 00:28:25,806
It'll be a tight fit, all right.

433
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,517
Do you even have a plan
for when this is all ready?

434
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,936
I figured I'd flip the switch
and see what happens.

435
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,813
- You would.
- No, this one here.

436
00:28:32,897 --> 00:28:34,023
Plan for what?

437
00:28:34,106 --> 00:28:37,359
For when the director is ready
to send itself here.

438
00:28:39,862 --> 00:28:41,155
As of right now,

439
00:28:41,238 --> 00:28:45,159
this entire farm is protected by
a space-time attenuator field.

440
00:28:45,242 --> 00:28:47,369
Covers the whole farm
in a 100-yard radius.

441
00:28:47,453 --> 00:28:48,829
Nothing will penetrate it.

442
00:28:48,913 --> 00:28:51,665
No electronics, no GPS,
no telemetry of any kind

443
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:53,167
in the 21st or the future.

444
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:55,795
So we're invisible
to the faction right now.

445
00:28:55,878 --> 00:28:56,921
And to the director.

446
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:59,799
It won't be able to send a messenger
or consciousness here,

447
00:28:59,882 --> 00:29:01,091
let alone itself.

448
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:03,593
As soon as we know the director's
back online, we'll be safe

449
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:05,720
and we can turn off the defenses.

450
00:29:05,805 --> 00:29:08,432
Then it can either come back to the 21st

451
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:10,100
or stay where it is.

452
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:11,852
Either way...

453
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:14,063
I'll have to feed the pigs
and milk the cow in the morning.

454
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:19,902
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would the director want

455
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,028
other teams to take each other out?

456
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:22,654
Maybe Grace was right.
Maybe it's the faction.

457
00:29:22,737 --> 00:29:25,490
Or maybe we're being punished
for helping her.

458
00:29:27,303 --> 00:29:28,805
Sorry, boss, nothing.

459
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:31,163
No other teams reporting
that they've encountered this.

460
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:33,248
Everything looks normal on the deep web.

461
00:29:33,896 --> 00:29:36,001
Well, there's nothing to report
if you don't survive.

462
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:38,831
Trevor, come in.

463
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:40,547
Trevor?

464
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,675
He could be in danger.
We have to warn him.

465
00:29:48,472 --> 00:29:51,016
Get down!

466
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:58,315
Go, go, go!

467
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,384
Why are you looking at me like that?

468
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:28,553
Nothing. No, I'm not.

469
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:32,432
Don't tell me you had a thing for her.

470
00:30:32,516 --> 00:30:34,684
- Who?
- Who do you think?

471
00:30:36,186 --> 00:30:38,688
Ew, don't tell me that's why
you took her out into the woods.

472
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:40,858
Grace Day was a lovely human being.

473
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:43,986
She didn't deserve to die,
that's all it was.

474
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:46,738
I'd prefer if you'd refer to me
in the present tense.

475
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,659
You know, if you're gonna
go on pretending to be her,

476
00:30:50,742 --> 00:30:52,077
you've got a lot of work to do.

477
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:53,370
Look who's talking.

478
00:30:53,453 --> 00:30:54,579
What's that supposed to mean?

479
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:56,498
Your school record says
your previous self

480
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:59,334
was a recalcitrant bully
whose only redeeming quality

481
00:30:59,418 --> 00:31:01,670
was a gift
for something called... football.

482
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:04,006
Trevor Holden wouldn't have
given Grace the time of day...

483
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:05,382
She didn't deserve to die.

484
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:07,592
Oh, but Trevor Holden did?
Is that what you're saying?

485
00:31:07,676 --> 00:31:09,469
Existence should be based on merit?

486
00:31:09,553 --> 00:31:12,139
You're a hypocrite.

487
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,769
How's our progress?

488
00:31:19,021 --> 00:31:20,855
I need to check in with my team.

489
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:33,868
<i>Just get to the farm.
We'll be right behind you.</i>

490
00:31:33,953 --> 00:31:36,496
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

491
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,332
I left Poppy behind.

492
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:40,084
- Who's Poppy?
- My turtle.

493
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,461
You mean it belonged to your host?

494
00:31:42,544 --> 00:31:44,754
No, I just bought it as a pet.

495
00:31:46,006 --> 00:31:47,007
You know, for company.

496
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,343
A turtle.

497
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:51,803
Yeah. That was a lot of gunfire.

498
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:53,638
What if she got shot?
You think she's gonna be okay?

499
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:54,932
I do.

500
00:32:00,354 --> 00:32:01,771
You're a little different.

501
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:03,648
It's weird.

502
00:32:03,732 --> 00:32:05,150
Than what?

503
00:32:06,318 --> 00:32:07,652
The Marcy I know.

504
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:09,857
Knew.

505
00:32:09,882 --> 00:32:11,865
I don't even know if that's possible.

506
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:17,829
I'm not saying that you're not you.

507
00:32:17,912 --> 00:32:19,164
Obviously, you're you.

508
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:21,125
How... how am I different?

509
00:32:22,084 --> 00:32:26,463
If I had to sum it up into one word,
I would say that Marcy 1.0...

510
00:32:26,546 --> 00:32:28,132
was more fragile.

511
00:32:33,012 --> 00:32:34,929
Maybe because you knew
you were gonna die.

512
00:32:35,014 --> 00:32:36,765
You don't have the same burden.

513
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:40,435
You don't think it's a burden
coming into a team who already knows you,

514
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,895
but you don't know them?

515
00:32:41,979 --> 00:32:43,981
I mean, other than the time
that you trained together.

516
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:46,566
- I'm sure it is.
- It's me, Philip.

517
00:32:47,428 --> 00:32:49,347
Just give me some time to catch up.

518
00:32:57,441 --> 00:32:59,027
Mr. Mailer,

519
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:01,665
I've got someone coming
to escort you to the station

520
00:33:01,748 --> 00:33:03,292
so we can talk further
while the investigation...

521
00:33:03,375 --> 00:33:05,335
I told you, the shot came outta nowhere.

522
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:08,463
Well, not nowhere.
It came from your neighbor's apartment.

523
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:10,173
We're gonna take a statement
from your neighbor.

524
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:11,966
Maybe she saw someone.

525
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,743
I don't have anything
more to add that...

526
00:33:13,768 --> 00:33:14,702
You've been under duress.

527
00:33:14,761 --> 00:33:17,431
We're gonna give you some time to think.

528
00:33:17,514 --> 00:33:19,016
Seriously, I'm fine.

529
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:21,643
Sir, a man was shot in the head
in your apartment,

530
00:33:21,726 --> 00:33:23,353
and you're obviously
holding back information,

531
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:25,730
including the nature
of your two cell phone calls

532
00:33:25,814 --> 00:33:27,691
prior to your calling 911.

533
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:32,071
Head on downstairs, please.

534
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:45,625
Something wrong?

535
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:48,837
Stop the car. I need to do something.

536
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:57,563
What?

537
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:08,534
We gotta stop doing this.

538
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,512
- Doing what?
- All of it. Any of it. I can't...

539
00:34:20,244 --> 00:34:23,330
We're fooling ourselves thinking
that we could bring to the 21st

540
00:34:23,413 --> 00:34:24,623
what should have been left behind.

541
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:26,791
I mean, Protocol 2...

542
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:29,669
"Leave the future in the past."
But we both decided...

543
00:34:29,753 --> 00:34:32,046
We can't make exceptions

544
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:34,883
because it's convenient, or personal.

545
00:34:37,594 --> 00:34:39,596
I mean, this relationship...

546
00:34:40,722 --> 00:34:42,349
we've been holding on to all this time,

547
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:45,852
it's jeopardizing our team,
our covers, our mission.

548
00:34:45,935 --> 00:34:47,229
And the mission comes first, right?

549
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:49,523
You know it does.

550
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:52,859
Look, I just... I think
we're better off...

551
00:34:52,942 --> 00:34:53,985
I get it.

552
00:34:54,778 --> 00:34:56,663
You've got your life
you gotta make work.

553
00:34:56,688 --> 00:34:57,680
I said I get it.

554
00:34:57,739 --> 00:34:59,408
You don't have to say any more.

555
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:06,523
Drive.

556
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:59,551
Stop! Stop what you're doing!

557
00:35:59,634 --> 00:36:01,175
- Stop what?
- Look at this.

558
00:36:01,309 --> 00:36:02,518
Look at this.

559
00:36:04,473 --> 00:36:05,557
Mission abort?

560
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,559
The director must be back online.

561
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:10,020
That message could've come
from your girlfriend for all we know.

562
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:12,647
She doesn't call me 0115.

563
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:15,275
Well, then it must be the faction.
They're on to what we're doing.

564
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,236
Or the director knows what you did

565
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:19,153
and communicated to me
the only way it could.

566
00:36:19,238 --> 00:36:20,822
You jumped into the 21st illegally.

567
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:23,032
You took a host that wasn't meant
for you. You uploaded a virus...

568
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:25,702
- All for the greater good.
- According to who? You?

569
00:36:25,785 --> 00:36:27,912
Listen, I told you that I had evidence

570
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:29,748
that an attack on the director
was imminent.

571
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:31,040
I had no choice but to act.

572
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:33,084
Well, all I can tell you is...

573
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:35,670
my mission didn't come to me as a text.

574
00:36:35,754 --> 00:36:37,631
It came from the director, personally.

575
00:36:38,673 --> 00:36:41,260
- Before the reset.
- What?

576
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:43,262
You received that mission
from the director

577
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:45,264
before I was able to send the reset.

578
00:36:45,347 --> 00:36:46,348
Obviously.

579
00:36:46,431 --> 00:36:48,433
I got here before you did.
What difference does it make?

580
00:36:48,517 --> 00:36:52,271
It was still vulnerable to corruption
by the faction at that time.

581
00:36:52,354 --> 00:36:54,063
You two can argue all you want.

582
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:56,441
I got my mission,
and I'm seeing it through.

583
00:36:57,234 --> 00:36:59,361
Then I'm just gonna have to stop you.

584
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:02,196
Trevor...

585
00:37:02,906 --> 00:37:04,408
Trevor, just...

586
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:06,701
- Hey!
- Whoa, guys!

587
00:37:06,785 --> 00:37:08,537
Good luck with that.

588
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:21,675
They're not in the house.

589
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:23,426
Okay. Well, let's have a look around.

590
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,970
Trevor!

591
00:37:25,053 --> 00:37:26,596
In the barn, guys!

592
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:42,779
What's going on, Trev?

593
00:37:42,862 --> 00:37:44,698
Oh, we were just having a conversation.

594
00:37:44,781 --> 00:37:45,949
At gunpoint?

595
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:48,410
You're not going to shoot anyone, Ellis.
Put the gun down.

596
00:37:48,493 --> 00:37:51,288
I've got a mission to get done,
and this young man objects.

597
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:53,332
Were you given a mission
to assassinate Trevor?

598
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:56,585
What? Where the hell did that come from?

599
00:37:56,668 --> 00:37:57,961
His mission was to build this.

600
00:37:58,603 --> 00:38:00,147
What is this?

601
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:02,215
Has to be a quantum frame.

602
00:38:02,299 --> 00:38:04,301
The director wanted a fail-safe

603
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:06,386
in the event it had to come back
to the 21st.

604
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,348
And I just received a mission
from the director to destroy it.

605
00:38:09,431 --> 00:38:11,182
- By messenger?
- Text.

606
00:38:11,265 --> 00:38:14,102
I went out of the range
of the attenuation field

607
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:15,729
to report in,
and this message showed up.

608
00:38:15,812 --> 00:38:18,064
Bah! That could be sent by anybody.

609
00:38:18,147 --> 00:38:19,566
It is pretty unorthodox.

610
00:38:19,649 --> 00:38:21,610
Or it was the only way
the director could communicate.

611
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:22,902
There's no kids within miles.

612
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:26,448
That message could have just as easily
come from the faction.

613
00:38:26,531 --> 00:38:28,992
Or the faction gave you
the order to build the quantum frame

614
00:38:29,075 --> 00:38:30,369
for their own purposes.

615
00:38:30,452 --> 00:38:31,495
Well, both can't be true.

616
00:38:31,578 --> 00:38:33,162
Let's figure it out, 'cause so far today,

617
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:36,082
every member of my team
has been targeted by assassins.

618
00:38:36,165 --> 00:38:37,917
More proof that the faction
is behind this.

619
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,503
That's not how the director does things.

620
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,671
Unless the director sent the assassins
because we helped you.

621
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:44,383
How can the faction possibly
send messages to the 21st

622
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:45,800
without the director knowing about it?

623
00:38:45,884 --> 00:38:49,596
The director was offline for a short time
after I sent the reset command.

624
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,681
Or the faction
has its own transfer system.

625
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:54,809
There were rumors they were trying
to build one of their own in Shelter 41.

626
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:57,186
Shelter 41 collapsed when I was a kid.

627
00:38:58,312 --> 00:38:59,648
This is something you remember?

628
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:01,650
We all remember.

629
00:39:01,733 --> 00:39:04,152
It was a structural flaw.
The weight of the ice was too much.

630
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:06,237
So we're setting aside Protocol 2 now?

631
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,824
It collapsed at exactly 0600
as the reveille bell rang.

632
00:39:09,908 --> 00:39:11,785
Thousands of people died.

633
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:13,412
It was horrible.

634
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:17,582
Well, now, the people
of Shelter 41 are very much alive

635
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:20,627
and the founders of an underground
movement against the director,

636
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,423
which eventually became known
as the faction.

637
00:39:24,506 --> 00:39:27,300
- This is news to you?
- To all of us.

638
00:39:27,384 --> 00:39:28,760
Well, apparently your work in the 21st

639
00:39:28,843 --> 00:39:31,388
has been a greater agent of change
in the future than we thought.

640
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:33,139
I'm just tryin' to get my head
around this.

641
00:39:33,222 --> 00:39:34,223
Yeah, you too?

642
00:39:34,307 --> 00:39:38,269
So you're telling me the future you left
wasn't divided into two camps?

643
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:40,397
One loyal to the director
and the other believing

644
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,483
that decisions should be made by people,
not a machine?

645
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:47,070
No, and that kind of division is what
got us into trouble in the first place.

646
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:50,281
The world we left was loyal
to the director and the grand plan.

647
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:52,116
Looks like all the grand plan
has done so far

648
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,116
is screw things up worse than before.

649
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:55,677
How do we know they're not right?

650
00:39:56,157 --> 00:39:57,354
What?

651
00:39:57,414 --> 00:39:58,998
Don't be ridiculous.

652
00:39:59,082 --> 00:40:03,128
Humans make decisions based
on greed and desire... hate.

653
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:04,713
- It's been proven.
- She's right.

654
00:40:04,796 --> 00:40:07,507
The director saved us
from the brink of extinction

655
00:40:07,591 --> 00:40:09,426
and created the grand plan,
we have to trust that.

656
00:40:09,509 --> 00:40:11,678
- Is that what you believe?
- Of course.

657
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:13,179
All of you?

658
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:17,183
I wish I could. But then again,

659
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:18,560
the director didn't send any of you

660
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:20,687
back into the body
of a young man addicted to heroin.

661
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:23,898
Listen, we cannot second-guess
what we came here to do.

662
00:40:23,982 --> 00:40:25,399
There is too much at stake.

663
00:40:25,484 --> 00:40:29,278
We have to have faith that the director
is working toward the greater good.

664
00:40:31,906 --> 00:40:33,450
So we should follow the director,

665
00:40:33,533 --> 00:40:35,869
no matter what mission we're given.

666
00:40:35,952 --> 00:40:38,121
- Is that right?
- What are you doing?

667
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:41,082
Carly?

668
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:43,627
Even if it's the hardest thing
you've ever had to do?

669
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:54,888
"Kill 3468."

670
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:56,556
That's what it says.

671
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,267
That is the mission
I was given by the director.

672
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:02,270
What do you think I should do?

673
00:41:03,897 --> 00:41:05,398
Well, if you're asking...

674
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,109
I prefer that you didn't.

675
00:41:11,195 --> 00:41:12,614
But it's not up to me.

676
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:16,535
What the hell is that?

677
00:41:16,618 --> 00:41:18,912
Someone's on the property.
Perimeter breach.

678
00:41:18,995 --> 00:41:21,080
- Assassins?
- The faction probably followed you here.

679
00:41:21,164 --> 00:41:25,209
Marcy, Philip, since you're not occupied
with gun pointing at the moment,

680
00:41:25,293 --> 00:41:27,086
would you go have a look outside, please?

681
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,588
Go over there.

682
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:34,969
I don't see anyone.

683
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:37,430
I saw movement over by the house.

684
00:41:37,514 --> 00:41:39,933
We have to destroy the quantum frame
before they get here.

685
00:41:40,016 --> 00:41:41,518
- Don't do it, son.
- Boss?

686
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:42,686
You know what you have to do.

687
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,521
We don't have a choice!
They're gonna be here soon!

688
00:41:44,604 --> 00:41:45,647
- Don't.
- There's another way.

689
00:42:07,544 --> 00:42:08,753
It went right through her.

690
00:42:11,881 --> 00:42:14,718
- Marcy! Help Trevor!
- Put the fucking gun down and help me!

691
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:20,098
Philip, what's going on out there?

692
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:22,266
- Philip!
- You'll be okay.

693
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,602
Keep applying pressure.

694
00:42:24,894 --> 00:42:26,437
She's a doctor. You'll be okay.

695
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,356
Turn off the defenses...

696
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:29,983
Drop the attenuation field.

697
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:31,901
The director could still help us.

698
00:42:31,985 --> 00:42:34,946
Okay.

699
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:42,078
They're getting closer.

700
00:42:50,544 --> 00:42:52,421
The director's coming!

701
00:42:57,176 --> 00:42:58,845
Traveler 3468.

702
00:42:58,928 --> 00:43:00,346
Mission abort.

703
00:43:00,429 --> 00:43:03,182
Destroy quantum frame immediately!

704
00:43:07,646 --> 00:43:09,313
They're surrounding the building.

705
00:43:10,857 --> 00:43:12,400
We need to get them out of here!

706
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:14,419
They're coming in!

707
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:17,196
Freeze! FBI! Drop your weapons!
