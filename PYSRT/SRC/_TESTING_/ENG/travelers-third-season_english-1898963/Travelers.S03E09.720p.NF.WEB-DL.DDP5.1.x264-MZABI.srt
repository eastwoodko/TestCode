1
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,288
Evacuate! Evacuate! Evacuate!

2
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,927
<i>Emergency responders
are on high alert in London tonight</i>

3
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:37,931
<i>as the city deals with the aftermath
of a devastating explosion.</i>

4
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:43,478
<i>Eyewitness video shows a mushroom cloud
rising from an apparent nuclear blast</i>

5
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:45,063
<i>that has created a firestorm</i>

6
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,150
<i>that continues to burn
in the heart of London.</i>

7
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,569
That's exactly what I saw.

8
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,738
- Except you saw it happen here.
- Except it didn't.

9
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,551
<i>Reports are flooding in
and we have just received word</i>

10
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:00,162
<i>that another explosion has happened,
this time in Shanghai, China.</i>

11
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,332
<i>It definitely looks like
the same type of explosion.</i>

12
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,168
<i>There's the mushroom cloud.
We still don't have any details.</i>

13
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,604
- Oh, God.
<i>- We haven't received word yet</i>

14
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:10,297
<i>on exactly when this happened,
but I believe it was just...</i>

15
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,673
- Another one.
- Where?

16
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,051
Another nuke went off in Shanghai.

17
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,054
<i>...somebody who saw
the explosion happen.</i>

18
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,293
<i>Hi, this is David Mailer.</i>

19
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,077
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

20
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,073
Hey, it's me. Uh, it's just after 6:00,
and you're not home,

21
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:40,786
and I think I'm going to start cooking
dinner, so fair warning.

22
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,164
Uh, okay. Call me. Bye.

23
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,851
Shit.

24
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,503
Hello?

25
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,922
Hello?

26
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,698
So how do we have this video?

27
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,021
A traveler team in Shanghai
tried to stop the second one.

28
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,137
They were live-streaming the mission
with their historian.

29
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,164
The devices went off
exactly an hour apart, on the hour.

30
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,498
They managed to send this.

31
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,589
- That looks like the Rothski device.
- Twenty-two years before its time.

32
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,817
- So this is definitely the Faction.
- There's one other thing.

33
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,551
Philip saw a bomb go off here, too.

34
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,261
Here in this city? How?

35
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,947
It must have been a projection
from another timeline.

36
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,973
At the exact same time
as the one in London.

37
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,391
So, what does that tell us?

38
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:29,155
Philip saw a timeline where the bombs
went off in a different order.

39
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,480
And the next one goes off on the hour.

40
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,400
The Faction stole enough enriched uranium
to make four or five of these things.

41
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,195
- One of them must be here.
- Where are you going?

42
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,572
To work. We need to warn people.

43
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,773
<i>Marcy, you there?
We need you back at Ops.</i>

44
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,543
Marcy?

45
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,272
<i>Yeah, yeah.
I'm here. I'll be there soon as I can.</i>

46
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:43,301
David?

47
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,013
David?

48
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,814
Hello? I'm in here! I'm inside!

49
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,376
<i>David?
Can you hear me?</i>

50
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:04,864
Marcy?

51
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,616
Yes, yeah. I'm... I'm here. I'm here.

52
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,163
Oh, my God, I can hear you inside my head.

53
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,000
That means I'm dying, doesn't it?

54
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,670
No, no, no. That is not what it means.
Are you hurt?

55
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,008
Uh...

56
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:26,761
I wanna say yes, but it doesn't hurt
as much as you think it would.

57
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,265
I got shot a whole bunch of times.

58
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:35,020
It's hard to see, there's so much blood,
but I don't think it's all mine.

59
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,229
What do you mean?

60
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,648
I was carrying bags of it.

61
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,527
This is an archive.

62
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,114
Archive, yes. Yeah, that's what the, um,

63
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,992
the dead woman
who's in here with me called it.

64
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,412
<i>Before she got shot in the head.</i>

65
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,959
Hey, Marce,
you wanna open the door so we can go home?

66
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:03,089
Because it's freezing cold in here
and I'm pretty sure this is a bad dream

67
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,800
and if I... if I can just get back
into my bed...

68
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,345
<i>You're not dead,
and you're not dreaming.</i>

69
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,722
Yeah, I want to believe you but, uh...

70
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:18,939
But there's like... There's like,
uh, bullet holes in my shirt,

71
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,025
which I'm wearing.

72
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,490
So the only alternative
that I can think of is that, uh...

73
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,660
That I'm a zombie.

74
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,181
<i>You're alive because
the blood bags you were holding onto</i>

75
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,248
<i>are full of something called nanites.</i>

76
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,584
<i>They're repairing the bullet damage. Okay?</i>

77
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:46,591
And you can hear me because I implanted
a communication device on your body.

78
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,969
Implanted?

79
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,555
I, uh... I embedded a comm
just below your ear.

80
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,559
What? When? Why?

81
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,020
In case something like this happened.

82
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,732
You've been listening to what I'm doing?

83
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,609
Yes.

84
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,280
Can you hear what I'm thinking?

85
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,782
No. David, stop talking.

86
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,742
What exactly have you heard me doing?

87
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,762
<i>Okay.
I need you to let go of that right now.</i>

88
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,306
'Cause we need to get you out of here.

89
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,082
Okay, okay, well, I mean,
I was gonna try the vault door,

90
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,669
but there's... there's lasers crossing
in front of it on this side.

91
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,212
<i>Do not cross the beams!</i>

92
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,132
Y-Yeah, I know enough
not to cross the beams.

93
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:32,178
Okay, just... just stay put
and stay calm. I'm calling in my team.

94
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,740
You're not gonna be able
to hear me right now, okay?

95
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,725
But just be patient.

96
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,144
Okay, but hold on, before you hang up,

97
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,022
there's something
that you should probably know.

98
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:47,027
There's a big metal box in here that...

99
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,988
was not here before.

100
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,253
What...

101
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,842
Hey! What the fuck?!

102
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,643
If the Faction's targeting archives,

103
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,104
then why haven't we received this mission
from the Director?

104
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,983
Maybe you're driving too fast
for a messenger to stop us.

105
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,048
<i>Philip,
how are those traffic lights coming?</i>

106
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,823
You're good to go,
all the way to First Ave.

107
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,911
Which I could have done from the van
driving with you.

108
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,015
<i>Somebody has to stay
outside the potential blast radius.</i>

109
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,434
Other traveler teams have to learn
from what's gonna happen there today

110
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,293
if we can't disarm the device in time.

111
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,151
MacLaren, I thought you were coming in.

112
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,070
- We found the bomb.
- <i>Where?</i>

113
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,364
In the old fair grounds.
Focus your evacuation there.

114
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,949
I can do that. Where are you now?

115
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,676
I've already turned around
and heading there now.

116
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,744
- My team's en route.
- What's the address?

117
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,248
<i>- You should evacuate...
- </i>MacLaren, which building?

118
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,209
The old roller rink on Wallace.
I'll meet you there.

119
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,479
What's he doing in there? Is he all right?

120
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,429
That answer is complicated.

121
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,598
- David!
- He can't hear you through the door.

122
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,326
That won't work either.
There's no service inside.

123
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,102
Then how are you communicating with him?

124
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,312
I, uh, I embedded a comm.

125
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,875
It was right after the kidnapping,
I was afraid for his safety...

126
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,984
Wow. Marcy.

127
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,462
- He wasn't even aware of it until now.
- It doesn't make it better.

128
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,714
All right, it's done.
Let's at least take advantage of it.

129
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,019
I assume that you can patch him through
to the whole team?

130
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,324
Yeah.

131
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,870
- Hey, Philip, you getting this?
- Five by five.

132
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,764
<i>Hey, David, it's me again.</i>

133
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:09,169
Hey, Marce, I was just running through
some recent private activities in my head.

134
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,730
<i>Okay, listen. The whole team's here,
and they want to talk to you directly.</i>

135
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,794
So you're gonna have to patch them in
from your end.

136
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,341
Okay, how do I do that?

137
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,595
<i>I need you to press right below
your left ear, right beside your jawline.</i>

138
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,346
What? This lump?

139
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,101
Jesus, Marcy, I thought that was a tumor.
You told me it was a cyst!

140
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,771
<i>It's called a comm, and special FBI teams
use it to communicate with each other.</i>

141
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,982
I need you to press on it
three times gently

142
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,345
and then hold it until it beeps.

143
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,404
Okay.

144
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,032
- <i>David?</i>
- Agent MacLaren?

145
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,074
Right, we gotta move here.

146
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,911
So listen carefully
and do exactly what we tell you to do.

147
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,305
<i>The next voice you'll hear
will be Trevor's.</i>

148
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,009
<i>He's gonna run you through the next steps.</i>

149
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,334
Hey, David. I want you to describe to me
the box you told Marcy about.

150
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,004
Uh, okay, it's, uh,
it's right in the middle of the room.

151
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,882
It's a big steel box with, like, a...

152
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,967
It's like a...

153
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,597
Like... I'm trying to describe
the top. It's like... I wanna say hatch.

154
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,516
The whole box is one foot by two feet
by three feet tall?

155
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,968
<i>Yeah, almost exactly.</i>

156
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,455
It's the same dimensions
as the Rothski device.

157
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,440
- I should be able to talk him through it.
- The what device?

158
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:15,360
You haven't told him yet?

159
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,947
The metal box is a casing
for a nuclear bomb.

160
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,241
<i>We can't get into the archive
without setting it off,</i>

161
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,035
<i>so you need to disarm it from inside.</i>

162
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,580
I... I need to what?

163
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,083
We need you to defuse the bomb, David.

164
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,627
- I know that's a lot to ask.
- A lot to ask?

165
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,297
All I wanted to do
was to get in better shape,

166
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,508
learn how to use a gun and flip people!

167
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,719
- This is way, way, way...
<i>- David. David.</i>

168
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,764
You told Agent Callahan at the farm
you wanted to man up.

169
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,133
We are running out of time,
and you're our only option.

170
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,019
So, now would be the moment
to man the fuck up.

171
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,455
<i>The terrorists
only left you inside there</i>

172
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,357
'cause they thought you were dead.
This is a stroke of luck, David.

173
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,900
Luck?

174
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,945
You can save a lot of people,
but we are running out of time.

175
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:00,822
Okay.

176
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,409
If that's true,
then you need to run, Marcy.

177
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,954
Please, please,
just get far away from here.

178
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:12,250
Nobody's leaving you here.
I'm not leaving you here.

179
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,627
<i>Hey, David, Philip here.</i>

180
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,380
<i>Just, uh, you know, FYI,</i>

181
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,134
<i>they don't have enough time
to get way even if they left now, so...</i>

182
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,936
Okay, go.

183
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,831
<i>If we're right
about the design,</i>

184
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,527
<i>the top of the device hinges open,
one side is screwed shut.</i>

185
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,072
Yeah, there's... there's two screws
on one side.

186
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:46,117
Okay, so what in that room
might possibly work as a screwdriver?

187
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,420
There's nothing like that.

188
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,546
Search the whole room.

189
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,757
<i>A piece of metal.
Maybe one of the shelves.</i>

190
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,028
I would need a screwdriver
to take apart the shelves.

191
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,052
I'm telling you...

192
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,306
there's nothing like that.

193
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,682
Check the archivist's body.

194
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:15,271
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,406
- I've got a knife!
- My man! Get to work on that first screw.

196
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,967
Don't put pressure
anywhere else on the case.

197
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,242
<i>Let me know when you're done.</i>

198
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,326
Okay.

199
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,871
It's working.

200
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,875
Guys, you've got company.

201
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,066
We got someone on the inside.
We're walking him through the procedure.

202
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,175
- One of your team?
- Her boyfriend.

203
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,028
<i>Okay, that's it.
Both screws are out.</i>

204
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,572
You're on fire, brother,
it should lift off freely now.

205
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,515
Go ahead and do that.
Then tell me what you see.

206
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,398
Uh, it's like a...

207
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,358
it's like a big metal plate.

208
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,317
That's the shielding plate.

209
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,682
It's friction fit.
It should lift right off in your hands.

210
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,825
Okay, what do I do with it?

211
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,427
<i>Put it down
on the ground gently</i>

212
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,011
<i>and then tell me what you see inside
starting from right to left.</i>

213
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,666
Getting real tight on time, guys.

214
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,751
Uh, there's like, uh... a brick-shaped box

215
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,838
with a bunch of, um, like,
electronicky things coming out of it

216
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,342
to... a cylinder
that's on either side

217
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,678
of what looks like,
uh, like a big shot put.

218
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,841
<i>Don't touch it,
that's the nuclear material.</i>

219
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,700
- Okay. That's good to know.
- Now here comes the fun part.

220
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,310
You see those thick cables coming out
of the electronicky thing?

221
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,187
- Yeah.
- Those feed the detonator,

222
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,748
but they've been rigged
with a tamper switch.

223
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,566
You have to short it with some wire.

224
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,527
Coming up on 60 seconds.

225
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,735
Jesus Christ.

226
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,778
- Trevor.
- Yeah, yeah.

227
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,061
There should be a ground wire
tucked behind those cables.

228
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,908
It might be green or yellow-green.

229
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,328
Forty-five seconds.

230
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,015
- All the wires are black!
- That's okay. That's not a problem.

231
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,083
It'll be the thinnest one,
connected directly...

232
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,297
Thirty seconds.

233
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,298
...to the casing.

234
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,384
You have to cut it free.

235
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,954
Sorry, I've got blood in my eyes.

236
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,181
David, it's the thinnest wire
connected directly to the casing.

237
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,099
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

238
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,436
- <i>Fifteen.</i>
- Okay, I think I found it.

239
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,896
Perfect. Now cut that wire.

240
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,409
- You guys hear that?
- David, grab the core with both hands,

241
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,996
pull it out as hard as you can
and throw it on the floor, now!

242
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,185
Did I do it?

243
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,480
Yeah. You did it.

244
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,526
The bomb is disarmed.

245
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,156
Okay, okay, so that's it?

246
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,535
Can I come out now?

247
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,412
Yes, sir, mission accomplished.

248
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,807
<i>Now that the bomb
is deactivated,</i>

249
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,166
<i>the laser should be disabled.</i>

250
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,520
<i>There's a biometric lock
on this side of the door,</i>

251
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,064
<i>there should be one on that side, too.</i>

252
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,756
Yeah, I see it. I think I know what to do.

253
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,479
Oh, my God.

254
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,441
It looks worse than it is.

255
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,656
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no. No.

256
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,035
David. You did great.
Better than anyone could have asked.

257
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:04,709
It's just a little burn.
It was really heating up in there.

258
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,294
Right, okay. Let's get you looked at.

259
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,689
- I'm taking him back to Ops.
- Maybe a proper hospital...

260
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,941
I need him where I know for certain
the Director can see him

261
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,008
and can send a D team.

262
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,969
- That's what it's gonna take.
- Okay.

263
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,448
Trev, go with them, I'll stay
with the archives until relief gets here.

264
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,349
Just in case the Faction tries something.

265
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,103
Wait, wait. What am I missing?

266
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,897
When David grabbed a hold
of the nuclear core,

267
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:29,150
his body was exposed to lethal radiation.

268
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:32,069
His internal organs
will begin to liquefy in a few hours.

269
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,368
But you have advanced technology.

270
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,121
I guess it's possible
the Director will send help.

271
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,166
But right now,
I need you to tell the S.A.C.

272
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,001
the Faction is targeting archives,

273
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,712
and there's another one just like this
in Russia.

274
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,651
<i>Not anymore, boss.</i>

275
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,134
Another device just detonated in Moscow.

276
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,262
Ours is the only archive left.

277
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,850
<i>This latest event marks the third
nuclear attack in as many hours,</i>

278
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,978
<i>and officials still do not know
who's behind the atta...</i>

279
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,162
Mission?

280
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,249
I don't know who the fuck
do you think that I am,

281
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,669
but I'm not playing your TV game.

282
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,019
Ugh. Fuck.

283
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,815
You just hit
a metro police officer, asshole.

284
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,957
This is vital to the future?

285
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,542
Since they arrived,

286
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,671
the Faction have been destroying elements
of the historical record

287
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,339
in order to blind the Director.

288
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,675
This is our countermeasure.

289
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:19,427
Blood?

290
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,805
Nanites placed in the blood

291
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:26,267
write and store information
into dormant genes of DNA.

292
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,146
You can archive a hell of lot of data
into a small amount of blood.

293
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,440
How much?

294
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:36,318
Pretty much all the digital information
in the 21st century.

295
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,362
Well, all that's useful to us.

296
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:41,490
Traffic cameras, cell phone videos,
phone calls.

297
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,492
How do you get it to the future?

298
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,621
The genetically rewritten blood
is transfused

299
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,916
into known ancestors
of people who survive until our time.

300
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,794
Why are you suddenly answering
all of my questions?

301
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,757
Because right now, I really need you
to believe we're on the same side.

302
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:12,480
3468? I'm 6117.
We're here to secure the site.

303
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,064
The core's at the back.

304
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,192
You think you can save the archive?

305
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,545
Depends on how badly
the blood was irradiated.

306
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,155
Archival nanites are pretty susceptible
to hard radiation.

307
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,074
I was afraid you'd say that.

308
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,410
They'll have to be replaced
with military-grade.

309
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,454
I'll leave you to it.

310
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,086
Where are you going?

311
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,922
Change my clothes
before I head back to Ops.

312
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:23,592
You mean the office.
We need to report what happened here.

313
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,427
How about you take the first draft?

314
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,719
- So this is your bat cave?
- Safe house. No bats.

315
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,220
So that's where the elevator is, I guess,
take you down to the other levels.

316
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,660
No, that's the bathroom.
This is the whole place.

317
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,269
All right. Get up on here.

318
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:17,938
Ow! Mother...

319
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,362
I think my hands
are burned worse than I thought.

320
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,030
They're very bad
and it's gonna get worse.

321
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,409
This should help with the pain.

322
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:36,873
No kidding.

323
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,001
What is that?

324
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,377
It's classified.

325
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,631
Too bad.
Have you guys tried that?

326
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,342
You all look worried.

327
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,218
We are.

328
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,198
Well, maybe MacLaren's right.
Maybe I should go to a real hospital.

329
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,350
No, this is where you need to be.

330
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,326
All right, let's get that shirt off you.

331
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:01,273
Uh, usually, I love it
when she says that.

332
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,319
- I also love this shirt.
- Hey, it's okay, just let her do her job.

333
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,490
Are you an FBI doctor, too?

334
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,157
Tactician.

335
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,203
Oh. I... I don't know what that is.

336
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:19,667
Where are they?

337
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,170
Hopefully, they're manufacturing
whatever they need and will be here soon.

338
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,534
They should have already been here by now
and you know it.

339
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,715
Marce, it's all right.

340
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,569
I mean, no matter what happens now,

341
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,012
didn't we just stop a nuclear bomb
from going off?

342
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:38,227
I mean, shouldn't there be a cake
and a "Yay, team"?

343
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,022
Maybe after we get you cleaned up
and you've rested a while.

344
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,025
All right. Let's get this shirt off.

345
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,126
Oh, my God.

346
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:05,754
- It's not my blood.
- Then whose...?

347
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,045
You know what? Never mind.

348
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,761
Happy as I am to see you,
I've got to change and get back out there.

349
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,639
They just canceled the evacuation alert.

350
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,766
I know, I was part of the team
that found the bomb.

351
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:22,603
Of course you were.

352
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:31,739
Okay. Get what you need,
get changed and go.

353
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,866
I want you out.

354
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,202
- What?
- Don't pretend you didn't hear me.

355
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,498
Why are you making a big deal
that I forgot something?

356
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,083
This isn't just something.

357
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:45,961
- Can we talk about this when I get home?
- No. This is my home!

358
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,005
You don't get to stay here, I do.

359
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,192
I couldn't believe your things
were still here when I walked in.

360
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,885
Did I not tell you about my fucking day?

361
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,471
Get back to it, then,
don't let me stop you!

362
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:03,437
Please, tell me you're not throwing away
a decade of marriage

363
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,022
and all the time before that

364
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:08,275
just because I couldn't remember something
that happened 17 years ago.

365
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,652
You know what I really threw away?

366
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,864
A chance to have a life with John.

367
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:18,118
- Why do you keep mentioning...?
- Instead, I chose you.

368
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,789
The man who came into my life
and swept me off my feet.

369
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,917
- The man you used to be.
- I am right here.

370
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,627
No, Grant. That's the problem.

371
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,795
That man is gone.

372
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,882
The new one scares me.

373
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,594
I packed your bags.

374
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,277
You only ever wear a third
of your wardrobe anyway, it's all there.

375
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,510
So, I was thinking...

376
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:22,182
I got shot several times
in something called an archive,

377
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,936
but I didn't die
because of something called nanites

378
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:30,524
that were in the blood I was holding
that repaired the bullet wounds,

379
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,571
and you installed a comm in my neck
that... that let us talk.

380
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:37,990
Mm-hmm.

381
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,909
And you still wanna stick with FBI doctor?

382
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,838
Are you gonna tell me
what's really going on?

383
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,085
I know I can be sometimes...

384
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,089
willfully naive, but, uh...

385
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,051
I'm not completely dumb.

386
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,516
Uh, how's the pain?

387
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,396
It's worse, actually.

388
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,319
I could use a top up of that magic drug.

389
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,662
Just get some more sleep, okay?

390
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,250
- We'll talk about it in the morning.
- Okay, but don't forget, okay?

391
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:36,423
Because I'd really like to hear
the answers... to those questions.

392
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,676
She's here.

393
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,141
Hey.

394
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,561
Still losing nanites?

395
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,885
We're down to 20 percent
of what we started with.

396
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:54,149
Bloodwork?

397
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,027
CBC every two hours.
Lymphocytes aren't looking good.

398
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:58,361
Okay.

399
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,198
Levofloxacin and iodine. Transfusions?

400
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,908
Stem cells and platelets so far.

401
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,802
I brought what nanites I had,

402
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,995
but what he's gonna need
is military-grade.

403
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:10,123
Thank you.

404
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,346
I just have to believe for what David did,

405
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,878
the Director has a D team
manufacturing them right now.

406
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,132
Okay. Shift change.

407
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,028
You need to get some rest
or you're not gonna be any good to him.

408
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,052
I got this.

409
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,573
- Ilsa, what's happening?
<i>- I'm receiving a transmission.</i>

410
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,368
From the Director?

411
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:49,329
<i>Presumably, but my functions
have not been suspended.</i>

412
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,206
<i>It appears to be an upload,</i>

413
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,334
<i>writing a large block of encrypted data
into my racetrack core.</i>

414
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,669
What?

415
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,586
Can you block it?

416
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,673
<i>- No.</i>
- Well...

417
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,756
Is it overwriting anything essential?
Are you okay?

418
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,013
<i>If it continues, my cognitive ability
will become significantly reduced.</i>

419
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,106
Hi. Yeah, yeah, I know it's late.

420
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,525
Yes, very late, okay. I'm sorry.

421
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,902
Just shut up for a second.

422
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,697
Something strange
is happening with Ilsa.

423
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,784
No, I don't want to talk about it
on the phone, just get over here.

424
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,141
Hey.

425
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,145
- Did she stay up with him all night?
- Yeah.

426
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,028
I made her take a couple of hours
when I first got here, but that's it.

427
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,441
How's he doing?

428
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:02,670
The small amount of nanites that I brought
kept him going through the night.

429
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,374
But they're already starting to fail, too.

430
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,199
Okay.

431
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,463
Shit. Mac!

432
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,777
- Listen to this.
<i>- Carly, it's Jeff,</i>

433
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,094
<i>I got kidnapped.</i>

434
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:30,430
<i>I got outta the room they had me in,
but they've got people at every exit.</i>

435
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,742
<i>I think it's like an abandoned mall
or something.</i>

436
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,185
<i>I know this breaks Protocol 6,
but I need you to...</i>

437
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:39,773
- How old is that message?
- At least eight hours.

438
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,733
Philip, pull up all the malls
in the area.

439
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,988
Can you identify which ones
are abandoned or under construction?

440
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,258
That's the only one it could be.

441
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,646
I need you to monitor the traffic cams
in and out of there.

442
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,871
Yes, sir.

443
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,167
Trev.

444
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,671
Looks like
it's just you and me again.

445
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,381
We'll comm in.

446
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,806
Hey.

447
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,641
Oh, it's you again.

448
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,603
Tell me how you're feeling.

449
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,233
Worse.

450
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,777
I'd go for a top up of that...

451
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,655
I only have so much.
I have to ration it.

452
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,034
I was hoping
that it wouldn't be necessary by now.

453
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,745
You're that good of a doctor?

454
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,374
No, I was just expecting help to arrive.

455
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,917
From the Director.

456
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,004
- What...?
- I heard you.

457
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,798
So, should I be jealous of this guy?

458
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,384
No.

459
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,512
David.

460
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,891
I don't really work for the FBI.

461
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,142
Yeah, no.

462
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:00,812
I know.

463
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,899
You're from the future.

464
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:06,818
The archivist told me.

465
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,073
I think she thought
I was one of you guys.

466
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,163
Sounds like you're trying
to save the world, huh?

467
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,083
Are you angry?

468
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,711
For trying to save the world?

469
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,421
No, for...

470
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,133
for deceiving you all this time.

471
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,677
I knew something was going on.

472
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,642
- Maybe for not trusting me.
- No.

473
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,353
I do trust you.

474
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,941
Not enough to tell me
that I'm not gonna make it.

475
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,194
And I know I'm not,
by the way I'm feeling...

476
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:53,365
David, David, David. I believe...
I believe that help is on the way.

477
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,492
I know that you do.

478
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,579
I love that about you.

479
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,499
You saved thousands of lives.

480
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,001
The Director has to save you for that.

481
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,922
I had the balls to do that
because you were there.

482
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:17,305
Instead of the good stuff,
maybe you can give me something else?

483
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,475
Because this pain...
This pain is getting real bad.

484
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,601
Okay, okay.

485
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,864
And then, maybe, can we go home?

486
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,251
The Director's gotta know
our address, right?

487
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:42,372
Okay.

488
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,207
Oh, this stuff is...

489
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,336
is making me sleepy.

490
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,425
I know. I know.

491
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:54,926
Please don't go, okay?

492
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,973
I wanna keep talking.
I'm just gonna close my eyes for a sec.

493
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,766
Stay.

494
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,332
Nothing on this level.

495
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,577
Carly, meet me at the loading dock,
I may have something.

496
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,356
Philip, we're too late. They're gone.

497
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,254
I'll go back in the feeds.
They had to be there at some point.

498
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,240
Hold up.

499
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:28,937
Carly.

500
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,524
We found him.

501
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,196
It just passed a petabyte.

502
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,782
Then it's overwriting her core memory now.
Can you stop it?

503
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:41,865
Not even if I wanted to.

504
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,495
Look, Ilsa may be artificial,
but life is life.

505
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,790
Are you trying to convince me
that you care now?

506
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,375
We both know your little secret.

507
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:53,086
Ilsa has only crossed
the sentience threshold

508
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,963
as a result of contact with the Director.

509
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,191
You kept it to yourself because you know
if the government found out,

510
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,935
they'd swoop in
and take Ilsa away from you.

511
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:02,804
Maybe that's true,
but it's still isn't right.

512
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:07,350
Well, don't worry.
The Director can't take a life.

513
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:12,522
Ilsa's capacity may be reduced,
but her core "consciousness,"

514
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,441
if you can call it that,
will be left intact.

515
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,484
The Director's just getting rid
of old coding,

516
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,570
you know, uh, redundancies and...

517
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:20,864
useless things.

518
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:24,284
Well, that makes me feel
a little better.

519
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,747
And I'll feel better when I find out

520
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,791
if this massive program it's downloading
is the one I think it is.

521
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,101
You've got another patient.

522
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,096
Hey, let me take a look.

523
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,480
Easy.

524
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,066
I got him, I got him.

525
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,402
Honestly, it's not that bad.

526
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:01,966
- Stop it. Let her help you.
- You don't look so good.

527
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,700
Maybe it's because I was captured,
questioned, and left for dead.

528
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,952
- By the Faction?
- By 001.

529
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,125
He was bricked in behind a false wall,
strapped to a wheelchair.

530
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:15,834
They're working together.

531
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,047
That was my mission. To find out.

532
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:21,925
Instead, they found me out.

533
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:26,012
If it wasn't for you...

534
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,815
How is he?

535
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:43,154
I need that D team to show up.

536
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,366
Right now. And I mean right now.

537
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,910
- Because he can't hold on any longer.
- Marcy, I...

538
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,205
Did you hear me?

539
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,333
I know that you know who I am.

540
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,752
I know that you're watching.

541
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,756
You saved my life
when you reset my consciousness.

542
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,969
You saved him after a plane crash
that he never should have survived.

543
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,639
So why won't you save the life of a man

544
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:13,810
who, without any training,
without having sworn any oath,

545
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,272
and without any regard for his own life,
saved thousands of people?

546
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,774
Why?

547
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,944
Marce?

548
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:25,947
Hey, hey. I'm sorry.

549
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,323
I'm here. I'm here.

550
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:28,407
No kidding.

551
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,661
I'm sure they heard you shouting
a mile away.

552
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:33,788
She had good reason.

553
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,624
Agent MacLaren.

554
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,879
Oh, I ruined your suit, didn't I?

555
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,508
- It looked like a really expensive one.
- That's okay.

556
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,761
David, I want you to know
how grateful we all are.

557
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:52,515
Not a lot of people can say
they saved 50,000 lives.

558
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,726
I'm gonna put that on my résumé.

559
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:57,937
So, I'm laying here wondering...

560
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,690
what's your real name?

561
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,902
In the future, I mean.

562
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,070
The future?

563
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:11,659
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

564
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,080
3468.

565
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:19,834
That's a dumb name.

566
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,045
Yeah, it is.

567
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,423
It's one of the things in the future
we're hoping to change.

568
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,675
What about you?

569
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,929
No, don't... don't tell me.

570
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,389
Marcy...

571
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,018
can we go home now?

572
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,355
I feel like I'd be more comfortable there.

573
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,818
Okay. Let's go home.

574
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,738
But can everyone else come?

575
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,325
Because I got a lot of other questions.

576
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,701
Everyone's here.

577
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,665
So why did you come all this way?

578
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,167
I mean, to this century.

579
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,063
Things aren't going so well
in the future, David.

580
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,588
And we wanted to change that.

581
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,132
Yeah, no, I mean...

582
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:14,806
Then why didn't you just tell us
what was gonna go wrong and how to fix it?

583
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,809
You already knew
what was going wrong.

584
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,143
And what you needed to do
to fix it.

585
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:21,645
Yeah, maybe...

586
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,901
We believed if we just stopped
enough bad things from happening,

587
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,820
the future we came from
would never happen.

588
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,198
Right, but why all the secrets?

589
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,534
I mean, why not just say,

590
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,122
"Hey, we're from the future.
Things are about to go ratshit.

591
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,708
- Let's fix this."
- Who would believe us?

592
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:44,770
Yeah, it does sound a little bullshitty
when you say it out loud.

593
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,045
It really does.

594
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,758
But you could prove it was true
pretty easy, couldn't you?

595
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,678
I mean, you must have knowledge
way beyond what we know.

596
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,931
And every world power
would do all that they could

597
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,475
to extract that knowledge
for its own gain.

598
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,356
The 21st century screwed things up, David.
We're just trying to clean up the mess.

599
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,567
But it's our mess.

600
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,193
Don't you get it?

601
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,281
We should be the ones to fix it.

602
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,619
What if after all that you've done,
it still doesn't work?

603
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,120
We haven't given up.

604
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,166
So long as the Director exists,
I doubt we ever will.

605
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,961
Wow.

606
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,132
I could talk all night
about this stuff.

607
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:36,054
We should have, like,
a big dinner here some time.

608
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,768
But I'm getting tired all of a sudden.

609
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,270
Okay. We'll go.

610
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,065
Thank you, David.

611
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:02,038
Ah, get over here, you hero, you.

612
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,665
Honestly. Good job, brother.

613
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,547
Bravest thing I've ever seen. Really.

614
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:16,928
Get some rest. You deserve it.

615
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,303
Don't be strangers.

616
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,264
Strangers?

617
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,143
David, you're part of the team now.

618
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,245
Don't you wish
you could just stay here like this?

619
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,789
Maybe we can.

620
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,542
Let's try.

621
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,641
<i>Boyd?</i>

622
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,643
