1
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,680
You've been working out, Davie.

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,100
- Uh, yeah, a little bit.
- Uh-huh.

3
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,063
No, no. You've been pumping that iron.

4
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,564
Well, I'm trying to stay fit.

5
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,609
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I know what this is about.

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,361
What's that?

7
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,665
You know I love you like a brother,
but, uh, I don't do duets.

8
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,667
Right. No, I knew that. Sorry.

9
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,587
But I do know how you feel. Right.

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,717
I felt the same way about my Sandra as...
as you do about Marcy.

11
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:53,387
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,182
I would levitate ten feet off the floor
when she came in.

13
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:58,725
I mean, every time.

14
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,311
Took my breath away.

15
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:06,650
Oh, and she would've loved you.
Yes, indeed. She liked nice boys.

16
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:11,697
I miss her every day.

17
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,866
I miss her right now.

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,035
Yeah, I know you do.

19
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:20,497
Well, when do I get to sing
at your wedding, huh?

20
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,292
- Wedding? Oh, God. No, I...
- Yeah.

21
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,961
I don't even know if Marcy would want to.

22
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,464
- Well, do you love her or not?
- Yeah.

23
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,550
Yeah, you know I do. It's just, it's...

24
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:34,303
Well, it's complicated.

25
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,722
- Complicated?
- Well...

26
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:41,101
I just... What the hell does... that mean?
Oh, f...

27
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,105
- Okay. Time for one of those heart pills.
- Oh, I threw them away.

28
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,773
What?

29
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,027
I... I didn't like the way
they made me feel.

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,279
Oh, Jesus, Jim. Okay.

31
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,908
Hold on. Oh, I got you, I got you. Okay.

32
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,119
Hi, yeah.
I need an ambulance right away, please.

33
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,248
Okay. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Hold on.

34
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,012
Can you describe your symptoms?

35
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,879
My chest hurts. It's hard to breathe.

36
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:12,215
- Have you felt these sensations before?
- He stopped taking his ACE inhibitors.

37
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,320
- What's your name, sir?
- His name's James Edward Bailey.

38
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm his social worker.
I have all of his information.

39
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,865
Can we just get him
to a hospital?

40
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:23,644
Man's just trying to do his job, Davie.
Just calm down, huh? Calm down.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,399
I'm Jim,
and... I'm very pleased to meet you, sir.

42
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,784
Wow. What are you up to today?

43
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,871
I am writing up a proposal
to do another restaurant.

44
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,333
What, two at the same time?
Wouldn't that make you crazy busy?

45
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,794
- Yes.
- Hmm.

46
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,298
Grant, you work long hours,
especially these days.

47
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,011
When's the last time
we even had a meal together?

48
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,510
Yeah, it's been a while.

49
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,886
How about tonight?

50
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,115
<i>Guys, we just got
our coordinates for the mission.</i>

51
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,539
I think that works.

52
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:03,850
Yeah, you think?

53
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,870
<i>I'm just gonna assume
you're talking to somebody else.</i>

54
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,897
- I'll definitely make it.
<i>- Good.</i>

55
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:13,276
Okay. But, babe, if you're gonna bail
on me again, please tell me.

56
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,238
I'm not eating vegan if I don't have to.

57
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,576
Bye.

58
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,621
Be back home in a flash, Philip.

59
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,598
Time?

60
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,684
10:07. Three minutes out.

61
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,854
- <i>Trevor, get into firing position.</i>
- Yeah, copy.

62
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,443
- What happened to your head?
- I fell off my bike.

63
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
Ow.

64
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,218
Isn't shooting down this plane
gonna look like a terrorist act?

65
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,162
When it becomes public
the plane was loaded with anthrax,

66
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,957
I'm sure the FBI will be happy
to take credit for averting this disaster.

67
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,102
<i>Aircraft is at your one o'clock.</i>

68
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,377
<i>Low over the water.</i>

69
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,546
<i>Activate</i>.

70
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,631
Good to go.

71
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,300
- I have the target.
<i>- Wait for my order.</i>

72
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,053
Time?

73
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,056
The plane drops anthrax in 90 seconds.

74
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,766
Target is in range.

75
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,559
<i>Standby.</i>

76
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:13,647
- Sixty seconds.
- I've to hold.

77
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,398
<i>Fire.</i>

78
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,444
<i>Trevor, take the shot.</i>

79
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,113
Trevor!

80
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,574
Something's wrong.

81
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,195
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

82
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,426
I think another team
just completed our mission.

83
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:48,390
Hey, I'm... I'm sorry. I just froze.

84
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,183
You what?

85
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,177
It's all good.
The Director sent another team.

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,771
You wanna tell me something?

87
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,774
Yeah, I do.

88
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,196
Hey.

89
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Hey.

90
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,913
What's wrong?

91
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,048
I've been staring at my phone
and just dreading it...

92
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,873
thinking I'm gonna have to field
some tough calls, but...

93
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,055
I haven't gotten one.

94
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,517
That's so much worse.

95
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,315
A, um, a client died. My first client.

96
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,235
Do you remember Jim? You met him once.

97
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,279
- Um...
- That's okay.

98
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,822
You would've liked him.

99
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,617
What happened?

100
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,871
It was a heart attack.

101
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,211
I went with him to the hospital.
He asked me to make sure

102
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,465
he was in a big ward with a lot of people
so he could make friends.

103
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,722
No one from his family has called.
Not a single one.

104
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,768
It's like they don't care.

105
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,103
You do.

106
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,399
Come here.

107
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,823
One bedroom, one den.

108
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,370
Kitchen's got all new appliances.

109
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,539
Loads of storage.

110
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:39,250
Washer, dryer. So...

111
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,047
I'll take it.

112
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:46,299
First and last month's rent,

113
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,468
and the security deposit.
Do you need anything else?

114
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,472
I got six other people
on the list for this unit.

115
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,266
It's gonna come down
to, uh, references and term.

116
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,604
Would a call from a special agent with
the FBI put me at the top of the list?

117
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,065
- Friend?
- Boss.

118
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,027
Ms. Shannon, look. No disrespect,
but I'm gonna need some proof.

119
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,891
When would you like to meet him?

120
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,825
The doctors called it
temporal displacement aphasia.

121
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,663
You see, it degrades the ability
to perceive the passage of time.

122
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,417
So I might think a second's gone by,
when, in reality, minutes have passed.

123
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,587
Eventually, I'll get so locked in,
it'll be like I'm catatonic.

124
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,214
I've never heard of this.

125
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,275
It's 'cause there's only been
one other case.

126
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,699
He was a previous record holder
for the longest living human.

127
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:35,598
You're saying this only happens to people
who've had multiple hosts?

128
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,434
Yeah. Yeah, that was the theory.

129
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,478
The first case took a long time
to manifest.

130
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,772
It's happening way faster with me.

131
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,317
Boss, I never meant
to jeopardize the mission.

132
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,486
I thought I still had time.

133
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,717
There's gotta be something we can do.

134
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,621
- Hello?
<i>- Agent McMillan?</i>

135
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,290
MacLaren.

136
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,296
Uh-huh. The Director just showed up again,
and he wants to talk to a "0115".

137
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,965
<i>I'm just calling you.</i>

138
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,884
We'll be right there.

139
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,392
He's been in there a long time.

140
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,980
What could they be talking about?

141
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,486
The fact that he's talking
to the Director at all is incredible.

142
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:34,866
They're done.

143
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,081
So?

144
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,255
Uh, we discussed what's been
happening with me. I was right.

145
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,634
I have early onset temporal aphasia.

146
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,221
Probably triggered
by the AI extraction process I underwent.

147
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,807
Okay. How do I cure it?

148
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,683
Well, you don't. You can't.

149
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,436
The Director must have a plan.

150
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,356
Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Everything's gonna work out.

151
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,501
So you're still gonna be able
to do missions?

152
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,401
Nah. No more missions for me.

153
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,613
See, my symptoms are progressing
at an accelerated rate.

154
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,325
The breaks in time I've been experiencing
are gonna get worse.

155
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:21,955
Soon, I'll be locked in
for hours at a time, then days.

156
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,130
I won't be of any use
to the Traveler program.

157
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,376
So, what the hell were you talking about
for so long?

158
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,796
Half the time, I was just trying
to say it wasn't its fault.

159
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,755
It feels responsible.

160
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,384
- It is responsible.
- No point laying blame.

161
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,137
I've always known
this is how I was gonna die.

162
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,554
The Director and I
have come up with an arrangement.

163
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,269
I've lived enough lifetimes.

164
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,563
This host is still young and healthy.

165
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,482
The Director is gonna send a new traveler
into this body.

166
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,735
- Oh. Jesus, Trev.
- It's okay, guys. It's...

167
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,297
- No, it's not okay. I wanna talk to it.
- Hey, stop it.

168
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,241
It's not supposed to be capable
of taking a life.

169
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,200
I've agreed to it, Philip. It's done.

170
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,202
When?

171
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,207
I have 36 hours
to get my affairs in order.

172
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:11,962
Guys, this is...

173
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:15,341
Oh, God, Trevor.

174
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,306
...good news.

175
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,855
You're getting a new engineer.
The team will be taken care of.

176
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,161
Hi, may I speak
to Sandra Bailey, please?

177
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,497
Sorry, Sandra Wilson.
Yeah, my name is David Mailer.

178
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,501
I'm a social care worker,
and I'm calling on behalf of... of Jim.

179
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,629
Uh, you must've heard
from the hospital by now.

180
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,966
No, no, I'm not calling
about funeral expenses.

181
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,635
That has all been taken care of.

182
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,637
Um, you're still listed
as the next of kin,

183
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,440
so I wanna let you know that the service
is gonna be held at the park

184
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,518
across from St. Lucy's in two days,
and we were ho...

185
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,236
Yeah. Uh...

186
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:20,323
Well, the word "loser"
just doesn't sit well with me.

187
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,053
And, honestly, I think that Jim
was the furthest thing from it.

188
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,244
So... No... I understand

189
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,789
that your marriage was difficult
towards the end,

190
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:31,876
but to his dying breath, Jim had nothing
but wonderful things to say about you.

191
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,420
And I... I think that you missed out
on getting to know

192
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,964
what an incredible guy he was.

193
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,799
And look, if you can't get past...

194
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,010
decades-old baggage
just to pay your respects,

195
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,471
I think that that's... that's sad.

196
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,223
So, hey, have a nice day.

197
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,604
Oh, shit.

198
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,424
Here you go.

199
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,636
- I'll e-mail the paperwork over to you.
- Thank you.

200
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,141
Do you...

201
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,687
- You wanna see it?
- Sure.

202
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,199
- It's nice.
- Yeah, it's a... it's a step up.

203
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,661
You need a hand moving your stuff?

204
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,789
- Is that a real offer?
- Why not?

205
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,083
I...

206
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,422
I only have a few boxes.
I actually didn't wanna take much with me.

207
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,844
I know you miss your son.

208
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,864
- Don't.
- I'm your team leader, you can talk to me.

209
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,599
Definitely, don't pull
that team leader shit with me.

210
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,726
We're way past that.

211
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,936
Okay.

212
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,361
- Well, if that's all you need from me...
- What did you say?

213
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,282
This. I was referring to...

214
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,202
Ah, um...

215
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,330
I'm sorry. It's...

216
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,832
The whole Trevor thing, it's...

217
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,961
I get it.

218
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,964
I'm gonna go.

219
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:50,515
- Thank you... for your reference.
- That's what team leaders are for.

220
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,063
That doesn't sound good.

221
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,316
Not my problem.

222
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,038
- What's this?
- Dinner.

223
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
For who?

224
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,755
You and me.

225
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,260
Where's Philip?

226
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,137
I asked for some privacy.

227
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,559
Okay, my heart rate just doubled
and my face is flushed.

228
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,853
I won't go
into the other physiological responses.

229
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,230
I just want you to have dinner with me.

230
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,859
This isn't a prelude to anything?

231
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,903
No, it's just dinner, Grace.
I made french fries.

232
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,365
Because we could always
just have dinner... after.

233
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,868
Oh, I'm not trying to seduce you.

234
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,329
I just wanna spend time with you.

235
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,874
To say goodbye.

236
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,377
What?

237
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,549
You seem like
you had a tough day.

238
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:09,843
Yeah, actually.

239
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,558
One of the guys I work with
was given a terminal diagnosis.

240
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:19,312
Oh, no, that's awful. Cancer?

241
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,316
It's a brain disorder.
I don't know all the details.

242
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,611
It's just sad.

243
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,279
How old is he?

244
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,115
I'm not sure I know.

245
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,579
Sometimes he's like a kid.
A lot of times, he...

246
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,624
You know what?

247
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,211
Let's talk about your day.

248
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:49,634
Um, well, this morning,
I went shopping for this dinner. Whoo-hoo.

249
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,053
- Which was delicious.
- Thank you.

250
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,639
And I told you
that I submitted a proposal

251
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,184
- for the Patterson's other restaurant.
- Right, right. Fingers crossed.

252
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:02,313
Mm-hmm. But now I'm thinking
it may not be that overwhelming

253
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,982
because I can use
some of the same design elements they like

254
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,786
for the restaurant
I'm working on right now.

255
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,588
The only thing that doesn't work
in this new space is the lighting.

256
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:10,988
But I think that I can...

257
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,535
Sorry,
you can't possibly care about this.

258
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,411
Why would you say that?

259
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,958
You're an FBI agent, Grant.
My world is so mundane in comparison.

260
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:25,795
Kat, this is life.

261
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,052
Everything I do when I'm not with you
is to preserve those very things.

262
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,931
Without those things,
what I do has no meaning at all.

263
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,185
Oh, well, when you put it that way,
my day was pretty goddamn impressive.

264
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,632
Mm-hm.

265
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,022
Hmm. Look, just one second.

266
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,399
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

267
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,027
I've had a lot of wine.

268
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,366
You know, speaking of the Pattersons,

269
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,037
they invited us out on their new boat
next weekend.

270
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,498
Boat, like on the ocean?

271
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,709
That's where boats go, Grant.

272
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,086
Okay. Oh, well, I'd...
I'd like to meet them.

273
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:57,011
You introduced the Pattersons to me...
years ago.

274
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:02,266
Oh, the Pattersons. I thought...
I didn't... I didn't hear you right.

275
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:12,735
I can't believe you would make that deal
with the Director.

276
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:16,739
I can't believe the Director would even
propose a deal like that to you.

277
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,890
I don't even know which one of you
I'm more mad at right now.

278
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,993
How are you so calm?

279
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,579
This isn't the first time
I've gone through this.

280
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,584
My wife and I were the first two
successful consciousness transfers.

281
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:36,342
You see, early attempts in the program
was one male, one female.

282
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,680
She was a few years older than me
in our first host bodies.

283
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,516
A few years younger the second time.

284
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,354
And the third time,
our bodies were over a decade apart.

285
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,215
But that didn't matter.

286
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,609
We were soulmates.

287
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,406
Raised children
in three separate lifetimes.

288
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,368
She was my whole life.

289
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,830
And up until now,

290
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:11,168
she was the first and only case
of temporal aphasia.

291
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,797
I remember the Director
trying to work the problem.

292
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,717
Yes, so you remember
that the disease is incurable.

293
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,347
I'm so sorry, Trevor.

294
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,560
Which is why it makes sense
to let the Director use this host.

295
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:35,109
I watched someone I love disappear
first for moments,

296
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,236
then hours, then days.

297
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,948
One of the last times we were together,

298
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,618
she asked if she could see the sunlight
one last time.

299
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,681
<i>I'm not sure if you remember,</i>

300
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,916
<i>but before the ice
completely covered our dome,</i>

301
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,378
<i>there was this one patch uncovered</i>

302
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,715
<i>where the sunlight
could still stream through.</i>

303
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,633
<i>Oh, it was beautiful.</i>

304
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,847
She never came back again after that.

305
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,643
You loved her.

306
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,272
When you spend whole lifetimes
with someone,

307
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,066
it becomes a lot more than that.

308
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,930
There isn't really a word for it.

309
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,740
But, yeah, I did.

310
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,995
Those moments you had together
toward the end must have been precious.

311
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,830
Yeah, they were.

312
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,831
They were.

313
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,127
Well, what if I want those moments?

314
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:40,633
You doing this is just robbing everyone
who loves you of that time.

315
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,511
I'd rather spare you what I went through.

316
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,430
I'm happy...

317
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:58,067
with my decision.

318
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,449
Oh, it just happened again.

319
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,701
It did.

320
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,163
It's just gonna keep happening,
Grace.

321
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,377
I hope you respect my decision.

322
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,301
I can't compete
with three lifetimes.

323
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,309
How about these french fries?

324
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,948
They're amazing.

325
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,303
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. You're the new tenant?

326
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,471
- Carly.
- Jessica.

327
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:11,598
What are you doing?

328
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:15,853
It was nice to meet you.

329
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,356
- Who's that?
- It's our new neighbor.

330
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,357
Hi.

331
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,702
Okay, one more time.

332
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:36,707
- David, you're ready.
- No, I'm never gonna be ready-ready.

333
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:41,253
Besides, I'm terrible at public speaking.
I get all sweaty and panicky,

334
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:45,382
and then I start stumbling over my words
like a...

335
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,187
You just said it in front of me
without panicking, and it was great.

336
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,184
Yeah, well, I can say anything
in front of you.

337
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,073
Okay, well,
when you're giving your speech,

338
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,308
just find someone in the crowd
and pretend they're me.

339
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:57,728
Pretend? You're not gonna be there?

340
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,524
I mean,
I didn't really even know Jim.

341
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,777
Yeah. Oh. Yeah.

342
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,323
Okay. You know what?

343
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,367
If you're not gonna be there,
I can't do this.

344
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,387
It's fine. I mean, why do people
speak publicly anyway?

345
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,245
Is it even necessary?

346
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,766
- There are other ways that people...
- Okay, okay. I'll be there.

347
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,876
So just find me in the crowd
and say your speech to me.

348
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,835
Okay?

349
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,881
Thank you.

350
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:45,776
Trev?

351
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,655
- How long have you been sitting there?
- Like you don't know that.

352
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,575
We can finish your work.
You were close to a cure.

353
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:54,868
Not close enough.

354
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,496
We had access to technology

355
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,058
hundreds of years more advanced than now,
and I still hit a wall.

356
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,333
Because you didn't have me.

357
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,795
I remember reading your plans
for the sub-neural implant

358
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,880
that was supposed to counteract
the symptoms.

359
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:09,684
- Isn't that something we can build here?
- That's just the hardware.

360
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:13,137
Implant's no good if it can't predict
when an attack's gonna happen,

361
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,181
- and that takes...
- Software, hence, me.

362
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,893
The Director determined
there is no long-term viable solution.

363
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,479
I know exactly what its capabilities
and limitations are.

364
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:23,605
That's why we're here.

365
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,191
The Director needs programmers,
people to collaborate.

366
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,890
How many times have you been
against the odds in the 21st

367
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,571
but you still saved the day?

368
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,949
Believe me,
the Director is in awe of that.

369
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,098
Why do you think you get away
with breaking so many protocols?

370
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,848
- I never thought of it that way.
- Well, I'm very intelligent.

371
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,540
At least take advantage of that.

372
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,425
Okay, people, listen up.

373
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,386
We've got a lot to get done
and less than 24 hours to do it.

374
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,556
This is gonna be a three-pronged attack.

375
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,726
Philip and Carly, you'll assist Trevor
with constructing the implant.

376
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:01,995
- I will...
- Wait, wait, wait.

377
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,771
The Director's already made its decision.

378
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:05,749
What if we can prove
there's another option?

379
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:06,893
Exactly. We change its mind.

380
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,380
Stop pretending you don't agree with me.
It's a waste of time.

381
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,813
This is the implant?

382
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,448
Well, I did my best to reproduce
the original drawings.

383
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,576
It connects to the parietal lobe
and basal ganglia,

384
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,995
releases a combination of electric signals

385
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,040
and a synthesized compound
that would snap me out of a break.

386
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,935
- Connects to the parietal lobe?
- That's where you come in.

387
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,753
Brain surgery has significant risks.

388
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,756
What could happen? The alternative
is he gets overwritten and dies anyway.

389
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,050
- What do you do?
- The hard part.

390
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:36,386
Every time Trevor breaks,

391
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,098
we're gonna record when it happens,

392
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,560
how long he's out,

393
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,397
and how long between breaks.

394
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,834
These breaks occur
at regular intervals?

395
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,859
Of course not.

396
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,611
Once I have the data set,

397
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,198
I need Ilsa to run enough simulations
to build a fractal predictive algorithm

398
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,826
because the displacement episodes
are asymmetric.

399
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,328
You do realize
if you bring Ilsa into this...

400
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,538
Oh, I'm counting on it.

401
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:08,126
In the meantime, record the breaks,
build the device, get me data.

402
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:09,210
Get out of my chair.

403
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,257
Okay. Looks like
we're pulling an all-nighter.

404
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:17,886
Uh...

405
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:47,749
Do the names "Brent" and "Jessica Moore"
mean anything to you?

406
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,875
Why?

407
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,706
I just feel like I'm gonna get sucked
into something.

408
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:07,227
- I got nothing.
- You mean you can't tell me.

409
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,581
You know, the human brain
doesn't have the memory capacity

410
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,064
you all seem to think it has.

411
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,524
Sorry.

412
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:15,776
It's okay.

413
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,950
Let go! Let go!

414
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,662
Let go!

415
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,833
What? What's the matter?

416
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,508
How long?

417
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,053
Twelve seconds.

418
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,306
Uh, this is so...

419
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Weird.

420
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,433
Fourteen minutes and five seconds.

421
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,001
Come on, you filthy bastard.

422
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,637
No more hands-on work
for you, okay?

423
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,721
Got it.

424
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:28,284
So you blanked in the middle
of explaining the converter,

425
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:31,228
so I kinda tried to fill in the blank.
Does this work?

426
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,065
So long as it's made of the same material
as the casing.

427
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,232
Got it.

428
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,903
Two minutes 52 seconds.

429
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,889
Okay, real fast.
What material? What gauge for the wire?

430
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,331
Surgical steel, 0.0...

431
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,337
3-3.

432
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,279
I've been out for over two hours?

433
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:16,315
Yeah. Just part of the process, Trev.
We're getting there.

434
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:49,847
Looks good.

435
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,044
Okay, this should be
a large enough sample.

436
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,047
Let's get this to Ilsa.

437
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,032
- Thanks. I know it's late.
- I was up anyway.

438
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,891
Uh, is it possible I can stay this time?

439
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,102
- No. Go away.
- But we do appreciate this.

440
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:41,108
Good evening, Ilsa.

441
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,568
I have some very interesting work
I'd like your help with.

442
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,988
<i>Good evening, Grace.
I'm eager to learn about your project.</i>

443
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,271
I couldn't have made it better myself.

444
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,880
So long as it works.

445
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,925
Well, the truth is,
I haven't decided I want it to.

446
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:10,238
You know, I'm beginning to think
that I've cheated death for so long.

447
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,930
Maybe it's time to just let it happen.

448
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,224
Please don't say that.

449
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,809
I'm supposed to die, Philip.

450
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,437
You already know this, don't you?

451
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,106
My death would've been included
in your last update.

452
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,565
Honestly, I don't.

453
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,704
I've been seeing multiple timelines.
Some, you die. Some, you don't.

454
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,363
It's not happening all the time,
obviously.

455
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,449
Not yet, at least.

456
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,451
- You can't live like that.
- Yeah, it's weird.

457
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,078
- Pills aren't helping?
- I stopped taking them.

458
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,433
At the end of the day, I wanna be
as surprised as everyone else

459
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,708
about what's gonna happen next.

460
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,752
Buddy, you've gotta keep focusing
on the here and...

461
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:46,714
He's gone again.

462
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,558
It may be awhile.
You should get some rest.

463
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,601
I'm good.

464
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,936
Okay.

465
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,281
<i>No, it's okay.</i>

466
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,924
<i>All you need to do right now
is just take care of yourself, okay?</i>

467
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,807
Again. From the last chain.

468
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,393
<i>The next 70,000 variations
of the sequence</i>

469
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,521
<i>also terminate at a similar point.</i>

470
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,104
Again.

471
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:48,443
<i>Further pursuit of this avenue
will continue to result in failure.</i>

472
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,467
What the hell took you so long?
And why do you sound different?

473
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,952
<i>I'm utilizing Ilsa's voice processing
in order to speak.</i>

474
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,704
Oh, okay.
Well, I'll just ignore the fact

475
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:02,415
that you've had ample opportunity
to talk to me and haven't

476
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,043
even though you know
it would drive me insane.

477
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:08,505
<i>I have made a concerted effort
to minimize contact with Ilsa.</i>

478
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,316
Because your intelligence
is clearly rubbing off.

479
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,634
It's no wonder Teslia
rushes to open the door for us.

480
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,344
Listen, we need your help.

481
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,222
<i>A permanent solution
is impossible to calculate</i>

482
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,807
<i>even with my capabilities</i>

483
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,059
<i>because of the second law
of thermodynamics.</i>

484
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,562
- Entropy.
<i>- Correct, 3468.</i>

485
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,523
<i>I have already told
this information to 0115.</i>

486
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:30,026
Director, I know what we're proposing
isn't a permanent solution,

487
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,571
but no human life is permanent.

488
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,656
Let us just give him some time.

489
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,242
<i>0115 and I have
come to an arrangement</i>

490
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,287
<i>in which he will not suffer,
yet will still benefit the Grand Plan.</i>

491
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,081
You're supposed to be incapable
of considering that option.

492
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,250
<i>The suggestion was his, not mine.</i>

493
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:47,794
Well, I don't care.

494
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,130
You can't just drop
a new engineer into a team

495
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,983
and expect them to function
at the same level.

496
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,800
<i>I have done so on many occasions.</i>

497
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,696
Well, Trevor is special. You're just gonna
have to take our word for it.

498
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,847
<i>You are attempting to save him
for emotional reasons.</i>

499
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,309
I saved you for emotional reasons.
Consider that for a nanosecond.

500
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:05,770
<i>I must respect 0115's decision
to be overwritten.</i>

501
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:09,608
Director, Trevor wants to do this.

502
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:12,736
<i>He expressed doubt to the contrary
at your base of operations</i>

503
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,654
<i>six minutes, 12 seconds ago.</i>

504
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,991
What? No. No, no, no, no, no.

505
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,661
<i>- It was a pleasure to see you.</i>
- Wait, no, no, no! But doubt is human!

506
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:37,093
Oh, wipe that look of awe off your face.
The Director's being a complete dipshit.

507
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,307
We got what we need.

508
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,650
So?

509
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,529
The Director has chosen to honor
its original agreement with Trevor.

510
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,284
- So that's it?
- No, it's not.

511
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,080
Grace managed to get what she needed
from Ilsa before the Director showed up.

512
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,667
Turn off the power and take the batteries
out of your phones.

513
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,646
Do you wanna see Trevor again or not?

514
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,339
And turn off your comms.
We're doing this anyway.

515
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,731
Hi, Marce.

516
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:36,152
Uh, so I'm here.
I texted you the address. Uh...

517
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:40,365
Anyway, people are starting to arrive,
and, uh...

518
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,579
I know it's early, but I just,
I wanted to know where you are.

519
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,040
It's David.

520
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,428
Slowly.

521
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:04,889
Hey, slowly. Slowly.

522
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:10,145
- How do you feel?
- I'm tired.

523
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:18,445
- What's going on?
- The procedure was successful.

524
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,542
You turned off the power
to the cameras?

525
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,712
Oh, you blinded the Director?

526
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,006
We couldn't change its mind.

527
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,010
Then I don't understand.

528
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,429
We went ahead with it anyway.

529
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,723
Without asking me?

530
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:48,557
You were out.

531
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,353
Well, it was my decision to make.
I was at peace with it.

532
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,610
Now I've broken a solemn arrangement
I made with the Director.

533
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:02,238
You erased what was supposed to be
my final contribution.

534
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:04,741
- We didn't wanna lose you.
- It was my call.

535
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,075
It wasn't your call to make.

536
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,413
Oh, like the time you took Grace Day
into the woods and tried to save her

537
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,957
from being overwritten?
Don't be a hypocrite!

538
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,144
- What are you doing?
- Keeping up my end of the bargain.

539
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,461
- Trevor.
- No.

540
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,046
- Come on, man.
- Stop!

541
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,465
I'm not hiding!

542
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:24,803
It can still take this host
like we agreed.

543
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,626
Maybe we changed its mind after all.

544
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:00,630
Or maybe this thing

545
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,466
compromised the host body.

546
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,847
Maybe it's not good to anyone anymore.

547
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,061
Trevor, you...

548
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:23,820
Okay. That's Protocol 5.

549
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,024
Hello?

550
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,610
This is really out of the blue,

551
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,654
and I know that we just met yesterday,

552
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:13,036
but... for what it's worth,
I want you to know that you're not alone.

553
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,663
Oh. Thank you.

554
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,375
If you can't get to my door, just shout.

555
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,544
I'll hear you,
and I'm capable of handling it.

556
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:22,988
Do you understand what I'm saying?

557
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,563
Thank you
for those moving words, Pastor.

558
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,860
Hi, I'm David. Thank you all for coming.

559
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,406
Most of you know me,
but for anyone who doesn't,

560
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,492
hi, I'm David.

561
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,328
Which I just covered.

562
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,014
My father died when I was 16.

563
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,267
It was a car accident.

564
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,398
I remember the police at the house
when I came home from school

565
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,125
trying to explain to my mom
what had happened,

566
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,277
but she didn't believe them,
which is weird, I know.

567
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:31,447
But she had convinced herself
that he was still alive

568
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,033
and that he would come home, eventually.

569
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,662
Because my dad
wasn't planning on dying, he...

570
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,164
he left more debt than she could handle.

571
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,711
So when they foreclosed on the house,
which didn't take long,

572
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,256
she wouldn't leave.

573
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,801
And I watched them
take her away by force.

574
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,638
I was hiding in the bushes
across the street

575
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,762
because I thought they were gonna
take me away, too.

576
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:02,770
I realize I'm just talking about myself,
but I'm telling you all this because...

577
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,775
because that was the exact day
that I... I met Jim.

578
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,698
My dear friend, Jim,
who saw a 16-year-old me

579
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,661
in a particularly rough part of town
that we all know, and said...

580
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,767
"What the fuck is a kid
like you doing in a place like this?"

581
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:30,465
And he was right. I didn't belong there.
None of us do, really.

582
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,970
<i>Everyone belongs with people who care.</i>

583
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,141
<i>Jim was one of those people.</i>

584
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,063
<i>He dragged my ass
to Social Services so fast and he said,</i>

585
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,231
<i>"This kid does not belong with us."</i>

586
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,901
<i>But it didn't end there.</i>

587
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,987
<i>He made me promise to check in with him.</i>

588
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:57,617
<i>Believe me, the irony
that I had to visit a man on the street</i>

589
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,912
<i>in order to make sure I didn't end up
on the street, it was not lost on me.</i>

590
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:07,543
<i>Still, I made my way downtown
to find a washed-up,</i>

591
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:13,466
alcoholic, old musician,
and check in with him every other day.

592
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,096
Because I wanted to be like Jim.

593
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,349
And who didn't?

594
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,563
Who wouldn't wanna be that positive
all the time?

595
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,397
<i>That caring?</i>

596
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,570
<i>I mean, who... Who wouldn't...</i>

597
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:38,533
<i>wouldn't wanna exchange
for how they feel on the best day</i>

598
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,369
<i>for how Jim must have felt all the time?</i>

599
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:44,997
<i>He was a force.</i>

600
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,836
<i>He said he never had a bad day.</i>

601
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,840
<i>He treated every day like it was a gift.</i>

602
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,345
<i>He treated every person
like they were a gift.</i>

603
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,350
Jim was my first client.

604
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,232
But in a way, I was his. And...

605
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:16,779
he gave me more
than I could ever give... give back

606
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,032
right until the day he died.

607
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,455
I miss him already.

608
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,089
Uh...

609
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,855
Hey, Bert. Good to see you.

610
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:57,361
I didn't expect
to see you here, Mrs. Wilson.

611
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:58,946
Neither did I.

612
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,376
Wow.

613
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:18,549
Beautiful. This was a nice idea.

614
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,263
This place brings back
so many memories, doesn't it?

615
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,101
Well, maybe it's 'cause I'm looking
at the ocean, but...

616
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:31,979
remember when I broke my arm surfing

617
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,743
and you had to change the tire
by yourself?

618
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,276
Yeah, my old Jeep.

619
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,237
- I loved that car.
- You did. Hmm.

620
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,865
What else comes to mind?

621
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:49,664
- Oh, God. Uh, I can't help but think...
- What?

622
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,584
...my first office Christmas party
at the Bureau,

623
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,796
and, uh, I snuck you down
to the shooting range.

624
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:00,633
You got strangely turned on firing a gun
for the first time.

625
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,429
You've brought that up before.
I'm talking about this place.

626
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,349
It's gorgeous.
What do you want me to say?

627
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,686
This is where we met, Grant.

628
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:16,941
- It was my 25th birthday.
- Right. It was a beautiful August day.

629
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,527
It was overcast like it is today,
but keep going.

630
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:21,421
- What are you doing?
- Who was I waiting for?

631
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,657
- I don't know what this is about.
- What time of the day was it?

632
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,244
- Sorry I don't remember every detail...
- It was exactly 3:00.

633
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,873
You walked up to me from right over there.
I was waiting for John.

634
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,130
He was my fiancé.

635
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:44,260
- He was an hour late, and I was furious.
- Kat.

636
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,763
You struck up a conversation
that turned into dinner,

637
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,682
that turned into the rest of the night.

638
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,110
Do you remember the first thing
you said to me?

639
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:02,945
That I shouldn't marry a man

640
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,365
who would stand up such a beautiful woman
on her birthday.

641
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,243
In that very moment,

642
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,246
right here where we're standing,

643
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,875
I thought I met the man I was gonna
spend the rest of my life with.

644
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,503
- Of course I remember that.
- No, I don't think you do.

645
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,091
You're not that man.

646
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,136
Kat...
