1
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:23,815
Slow down, man.
This is very early for me.

2
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,339
Just push through it, Philip.
I'll tell you when you're tired.

3
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,196
Is that it? We're done?

4
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,825
Nah. It's Gary letting me know
they're on the road.

5
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,911
His mother passed.

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,360
You probably already knew that.

7
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:42,209
Contrary to popular belief,
I don't have a memory of everything.

8
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:47,130
Just certain things deemed important
by the programmers or the Director.

9
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,091
Grandma Gary's death wasn't one of 'em?

10
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,343
Not everybody has a part to play
in the grand plan.

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:55,097
Well, she wasn't the type to take
something like that personally, so...

12
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,862
I did know
about your grandfather's death.

13
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,518
He was a host candidate.
Never chosen, but...

14
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,187
See, now you're
just trying to distract me

15
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,083
- so you can get out of exercise.
- And you're just trying to torture me.

16
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,817
Philip, once you've lived in a body so old

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,361
that the slightest fall
would shatter your bones,

18
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:13,073
and I sincerely hope you live so long,
then you'll know this isn't torture.

19
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,576
So on your feet, roomie.

20
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,119
Come on.

21
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:22,165
Come on.

22
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,877
Nuclear energy is considered
a form of clean air energy

23
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,839
because it doesn't produce
greenhouse gas.

24
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,716
But there are some people who think

25
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,970
that label ignores one important
by-product of the process.

26
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,305
Does anybody know what that is?

27
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:41,768
It's something you have left
when the radioactive fuel is spent.

28
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,395
We forgot.

29
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,732
Okay, we talked about this in class.
You know this.

30
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,028
<i>This is an emergency evacuation alert.</i>

31
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,571
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

32
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:55,449
<i>All personnel, evacuate immediately.</i>

33
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,742
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

34
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,505
Okay, everyone follow me back
to the bus right now. Walk. Don't run.

35
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,872
<i>This is an emergency evacuation alert.</i>

36
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,457
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

37
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,790
<i>All personnel...</i>

38
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,769
We were called in to assist.
We have clearance.

39
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,938
I don't care what your pass says.
Exit the building now.

40
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,005
There isn't much time.

41
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,424
You don't understand.
We need to get in there.

42
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,987
I'm locked out of the backups, too.

43
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,411
<i>Containment doors
in sector 77 are secure.</i>

44
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,825
<i>Loading bay doors
are not responding.</i>

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,160
I can't even perform
a system-wide reboot.

46
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,169
<i>What are your
conversion numbers coming in at?</i>

47
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,513
They're trying to break in again.

48
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,796
Come on, come on, come on.

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,741
<i>...a drill.
All personnel, evacuate immediately.</i>

50
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,368
Shit. I'm locked out.

51
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,203
Who are these guys?

52
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,953
Nothing's working.

53
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,267
<i>Warning. Levels critical.</i>

54
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,936
Pressure in the primary coolant loop
just went up another 22 percent.

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,189
- The porvs are gonna vent automatically.
- Shut them down.

56
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,316
The system isn't designed
to handle that much. It'll blow.

57
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,383
<i>Levels critical.</i>

58
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,929
<i>Warning. Levels critical.</i>

59
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,807
<i>Warning. Levels critical.</i>

60
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:05,977
Wait.

61
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,082
- Pressure's dropping.
- How did you do it?

62
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,109
I don't know. I don't care.

63
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,201
Hey. What are you doing in here?

64
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,666
We need some help in here.

65
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,917
Hey. Hey!

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,961
Somebody call an ambulance! We need help!

67
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,861
Good morning.

68
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,156
You seem surprised to see me.

69
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,950
No. Why would I be?

70
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,035
Well, 'cause I'm usually gone
by now, but...

71
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,998
I just wanted to say how happy I was
to see you home last night.

72
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,960
Even if it was just for a split second
before you ran off into the bedroom.

73
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,631
- I did not run off. I was tired.
- Uh-huh?

74
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,550
So tired, you pretended to be asleep

75
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,303
when I got into bed a minute later,
and when I woke up?

76
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:23,388
I was not pretending.

77
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,766
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

78
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,644
'Cause for a moment there,
I was afraid you were trying to avoid me.

79
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,940
I did wait up for you.
But it got late and I was getting tired,

80
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:36,485
and I knew if I stayed,
we'd end up talking for hours, so...

81
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,946
What would be so wrong with that?
That's one of the things we do best.

82
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,949
Well, it's in the top two.

83
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,683
Okay, you know what?
Do we have to talk about this right now?

84
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,914
So when's a good time?
What, do I have to book an appointment?

85
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,043
We already have one.
Tomorrow at 3:00, remember?

86
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,837
- I texted you.
- Oh, God. Right.

87
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,381
We're paying someone
to have a conversation.

88
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,262
Okay, I have to go back to my mom,
so I'm gonna go and get ready.

89
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,346
Kat.

90
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,228
Tomorrow at 3:00... I'll be there.

91
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,615
- Well, you don't have a fever.
- I could've told you that.

92
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,699
I'm fine.

93
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,744
Honey, you were taken
to a hospital yesterday

94
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,430
and can't remember
what you were doing, so...

95
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,040
A-F-0-0-1-3-

96
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,001
B-E-6-9-4-8-

97
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,128
1-C-3-2-D...

98
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,340
- Naomi? I don't understand.
- ...1-3-0-5-7...

99
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,344
- 1-4-1-0-5...
- Honey, what are you saying?

100
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,097
- Naomi.
- ...2-8-8-4...

101
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,223
Honey?

102
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,724
B-C...

103
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,482
- What?
- Good morning.

104
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,316
What are you doing here?

105
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,862
- I brought breakfast.
- Why?

106
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,824
Because it's the most far out thing
I've ever tasted in my life.

107
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,202
Three completely different foods
on a muffin from England.

108
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,913
Welcome to the 21st.

109
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,206
Thank you.

110
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,130
So...
I was practicing driving,

111
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,963
and I followed another car
into this restaurant drive-through,

112
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,726
and I asked the lady
at the window, I said,

113
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,651
"Just give me
what the guy ahead of me ordered."

114
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,386
And she asked
if I wanted to make it a meal.

115
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,887
And I said,
"Hey, ma'am, that's what I'm here for."

116
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,561
Hey, don't let it get cold.

117
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,884
- That's some good stuff right there.
- What do you want?

118
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:38,897
Your help.

119
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:40,441
Ask your team.

120
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:41,693
I don't have a team.

121
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,069
Why not?

122
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,434
I probably shouldn't answer that
on account of Protocol 6.

123
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,198
Okay. What about your training?

124
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,882
Part of my training was to come
talk to you. Learn all about Jeff.

125
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:55,691
All right, what do you wanna know?

126
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,753
Look... I get that my host
wasn't the finest human being.

127
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,047
- He was an asshole.
- I bet he was.

128
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,426
Because I know how far you went to make
damn sure that he was a host candidate.

129
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,639
And that you came this close
to killing him with your bare hands.

130
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,642
But I'm not him.

131
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,311
Good.

132
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,564
But I do need to be able to fake it.

133
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,035
So any information
that you could give me...

134
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,239
- What is it?
- Probably just David Mailer.

135
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,618
Apparently, I wanted to meet up with him.

136
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,620
- Do you know what about?
- No.

137
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,831
- Should I?
- If you think it's your Protocol 5.

138
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,299
Well, no, he's not...
he's not really my type.

139
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:40,501
That's not what I meant.

140
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,420
I know.

141
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,944
Listen. I'm just trying to figure out
what I'm supposed to be.

142
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:51,805
What?

143
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,968
Yeah, this isn't David.
You mind if we do this later?

144
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,266
Sure.

145
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,496
...<i>there was an option.</i>

146
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:06,945
Should have it to you
by the end of the day.

147
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,573
Thanks. I wish I didn't need it, but...

148
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,784
Whoa.

149
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,744
Message incoming on the deep.

150
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:20,959
"Programmer urgently required
to resolve corrupted messenger."

151
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,710
Has that happened before?

152
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,339
- Sounds like it just did.
- Okay.

153
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,384
I'll tell them we got one.
Make up an ID for Grace, please.

154
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:39,352
Grace Day, FBI Specialist
in socially inappropriate behavior.

155
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,360
For the record,
I take offence to your instructions.

156
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,654
- Which part?
- "Try not to speak."

157
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,449
You can submit your objection
in writing to the Director

158
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,950
in a few hundred years.

159
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,835
- Mrs. Gillen.
- Yes?

160
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:07,255
Special Agent Grant MacLaren with the FBI.
These are my associates.

161
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,425
We're here to do a medical follow-up
on the incident involving your daughter

162
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,828
at the Seaton Generating Station.

163
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,178
Why would the FBI be involved?

164
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,740
It's a formality, really. We'll be out
of your hair in a few minutes.

165
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,932
- The doctor said that she was fine.
- I'm sure she is.

166
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,935
But because Seaton's a nuclear facility
under federal jurisdiction,

167
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,271
- you know how it is.
- It's a simple test.

168
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,398
- We'll be in and out.
- So where is she?

169
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,904
That is Grace.

170
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,572
Please, come in.

171
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,660
D-7-1-3-5-0...

172
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,288
- Oh, hey there.
- It started up again?

173
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,792
She's been doing this on and off
since the field trip.

174
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,835
I can't make out
what she's saying, but it's...

175
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,253
Wow, it's still running.

176
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,841
She means running a fever.

177
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,362
Yeah, but we just checked a half hour ago.
Her temperature's perfectly normal.

178
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,906
How about the string of hexidecimal code
she's mumbling through?

179
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,409
Doctor said that was, uh,
a post traumatic response

180
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,273
from the alarm going off
during the field trip.

181
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,814
- Well, your doctor sounds like an idiot.
- Let's just run the test, shall we?

182
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,775
D-6-2-7-C-5-0-0...

183
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,486
- What's her name again?
- Naomi.

184
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,530
- I know a Naomi.
- It's from the Bible.

185
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,425
This one's a skinny ninth grader
with a speech impediment.

186
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,076
Okay. Naomi...

187
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,454
I need you to look at this tablet
uninterrupted for at least 20 seconds.

188
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,206
That's all you need to do.

189
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,834
And then we can celebrate with cake
or something.

190
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,104
Yeah, how is looking at that
gonna help with anything?

191
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,171
There's an interrupted program
inside her brain

192
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,132
that hasn't completed its end script

193
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,093
and is causing junk processes
that are more or less shorting her out.

194
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,761
It's a metaphor.

195
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,223
- It won't hurt.
- Uninterrupted for 20 seconds.

196
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,292
Oh, somebody needs to hold her still.

197
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,316
- She doesn't wanna look at it.
- I assure you this is necessary.

198
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,568
Dan, it's fine.

199
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,718
Naomi?

200
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,970
Mom?

201
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,265
How did I get here?

202
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,601
You don't remember?

203
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,686
Some disorientation is normal.

204
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,522
- Sure. We'll go with that.
- Well, we're done here.

205
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,066
- Thank you so much, Mr. and Mrs. Gillen.
- Thank you.

206
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,420
And please call me
with any further questions or concerns.

207
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,444
Mm-hm.

208
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,740
Grace.

209
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,933
<i>I gotta say,
this is a bit outside my element.</i>

210
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,061
<i>I've got a great selection
in the cabinet for beginners here.</i>

211
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:10,414
<i>It's kinda small, isn't it?</i>

212
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,607
<i>You know they say size doesn't matter.</i>

213
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,234
<i>Right, yeah.
What, they have to say that?</i>

214
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,320
<i>It's the stopping power of the caliber.</i>

215
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,488
<i>Right.</i>

216
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,239
David, what are you doing?

217
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,868
<i>Wow, that is...
That's way heavier than it looks.</i>

218
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,914
Our Father who art in Heaven,

219
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,292
hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come,

220
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,920
Thy will be done on earth...

221
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,215
- ...as it is in Heaven.
- 6-F-0-0-1-1...

222
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,298
Naomi?

223
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,927
- ...3-6-7-8-9...
- Naomi.

224
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,929
- ...5-4-3...
- Naomi.

225
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:49,644
...as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread and...

226
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,065
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

227
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,732
Nothing, honey.

228
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,495
Jeff.

229
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,748
Hey. Mitch. Glad you got our note.

230
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,752
So how'd you know?

231
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,212
That you belong in our group?

232
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,841
Well, you haven't exactly kept
your opinions to yourself at work, right?

233
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,468
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess not.
- Yeah.

234
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,564
The others will be here in a bit.
You wanna give me a hand setting up?

235
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,103
Thanks.

236
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,527
Okay, kiddo. Let's go see Dr. Lee.

237
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,494
Hon.

238
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,923
The most important thing
to remember is that we're not alone.

239
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,927
Travelers have impacted all of our lives.

240
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:09,015
But the truth is being covered up
by the media, by the government,

241
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,268
and especially by those people
in our lives who we know have changed,

242
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,313
no matter how hard they wanna try
and convince us otherwise.

243
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,816
So I think a good place for us to start
would be for us to share, um...

244
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,111
You all right?

245
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,239
Yeah, think so.

246
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,284
I just didn't expect it to be
so many people.

247
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,287
I've been at this a while alone,
you know.

248
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,289
I get it. We all do.

249
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,792
And we've all been there.

250
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,671
You know, I'm not gonna lie,

251
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:45,134
I was a bit scared that this group
would be, you know... them.

252
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,679
To find me out
and then take me over, too.

253
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,058
I've been scared to talk to people.

254
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,286
Well, I think I can speak
for everybody here

255
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,355
when I say that that's what it was like
for all of us the first time, Jeff.

256
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,814
But you're safe here.

257
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:02,943
It's okay.

258
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,656
- It was the correct code.
- Obviously not.

259
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,742
Every messenger is essentially
a convertible wetware program

260
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,869
with a shut-off script
which eradicates itself

261
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,830
from the host
once the message is complete.

262
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,667
- I gave it the correct shut-off script.
- So the Director made a mistake?

263
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:22,004
Did a nuclear power plant
release a cloud of radioactive steam

264
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,923
and kill thousands of people yesterday?

265
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,049
No.

266
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,611
I'm guessing that didn't happen
in the timeline

267
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,178
- you guys remember.
- No.

268
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,657
Well, it was
a hell of a historical event when I left.

269
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,492
I've been dreading it the whole time
since I got here,

270
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,643
just trusting
that the Director would stop it.

271
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,019
But why use Naomi?

272
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,730
Why wasn't the mission assigned
to a Traveler team?

273
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,983
- Maybe it was.
- And they failed.

274
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,276
Happens all the time.

275
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,112
So the Director took a risk
based on statistical probabilities,

276
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:50,825
went to a back-up plan out of necessity,
and... mistakenly created an outlier.

277
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,118
Which we will take care of.

278
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,620
What are you so grumpy about?

279
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,373
You wouldn't understand.

280
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,959
Oh. Marriage problems.

281
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,087
If you wanna talk,
I am a licensed counsellor.

282
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,724
The Lord commands you to leave this vessel
and return from whence you came.

283
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,560
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- What are they doing here?

284
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,313
- What is he doing here?
- I called them. Dan, we need help.

285
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,314
We're getting help.

286
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,525
And while that probably can't hurt,
she needs medical attention.

287
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:27,445
The doctors said she was fine.
This is beyond medicine.

288
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,072
- You think she's possessed?
- I believe it's possible.

289
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,866
And a grown man wearing a dress

290
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,951
singing to his imaginary friend
is the answer?

291
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,037
- I think you need leave.
- Mr. Gillen...

292
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,581
Dan, please, just let them try.

293
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,460
Father, can they have a moment
with Naomi, please?

294
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,630
I can return later this afternoon.

295
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,215
Thank you.

296
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,593
May the Lord work through you.

297
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,595
- May you get a real job someday.
- Grace.

298
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:53,721
Carly?

299
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,849
All right.

300
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,572
- Okay?
- Okay.

301
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,325
I'm reading the...

302
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,913
- Oh, shit.
- What is it?

303
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,375
This isn't anything like
a normal messenger program. This is...

304
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,088
It's a highly sophisticated AI.
It's almost an emerging consciousness.

305
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,840
- Why would the Director do that?
- I don't know.

306
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,820
But a conventional end script won't do it.
I have to use a kill switch program.

307
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,888
8-0-0-1-3-8-9-9...

308
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,146
Hold that up to her.

309
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,088
- What are you doing to her?
- Hold her down.

310
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,112
Mac.

311
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,000
- Stop it!
- Carly, take it away.

312
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,981
- Pulse is strong but rapid.
- There's too much strain on the host.

313
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,816
- We need to get her to Ops.
- Get her sedated.

314
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,967
No, no. Where are you taking her?

315
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,331
- To a medical facility.
- She isn't going anywhere.

316
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,346
Your daughter needs treatment
she can't get here.

317
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,265
Our facility is highly restricted,

318
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,642
and clearing civilians takes time
we don't have.

319
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,144
Over my dead body.

320
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,271
Sir, you need to listen to reason.

321
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,108
Huh.

322
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,236
That was unexpected.

323
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,280
I'm Traveler 5322.

324
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,658
- Why the hell didn't you say so?
- Protocol 6.

325
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,262
I'm the one who put out the request
for a programmer on the backchannel.

326
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,954
My medic had no idea what to do.

327
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:45,056
And obviously, I had to maintain my cover
in front of my husband.

328
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,335
- About your husband...
- He'll be out for a while.

329
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,976
In the meantime, I'll think of something.

330
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,424
Most important thing is you get
that rogue program out of Naomi.

331
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,552
I care about my daughter very much.

332
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,446
D-13 told me that these particular nanites
were supposed to save the life

333
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,783
of a Nobel Prize winner on the verge
of a breakthrough in desalinization.

334
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,410
Well, guess the Director
is gonna have to fix its mistake

335
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,162
before the world gets clean water.

336
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,721
So this activity isn't her own.

337
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,376
It's the AI unpacking itself
inside of her brain.

338
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,462
Stressing her system so much
that it's starting to cause tissue damage.

339
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,756
Well, obviously,
this wasn't the Director's intention.

340
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,925
A messenger program
is still a form of AI

341
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,528
even if it's not a full consciousness.

342
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,430
It has to temporarily manipulate
the host's limbic and nervous systems

343
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,725
in order to take control
of the body's movement and speech.

344
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,019
What did she do at the power plant?

345
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,440
Somehow she stopped black hat hackers
operating out of Eastern Europe

346
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:54,276
attempting a killdisk on the Seaton
Power Plant's operating system.

347
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,331
Sensor failure caused a pressure build-up
in the primary coolant line

348
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,075
that historically triggered an explosion
of highly radioactive steam

349
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,660
that spread in a 20-mile radius.

350
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,871
Nine thousand dead short-term,
ten times that long-term.

351
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:08,791
You got an update, I see.

352
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,585
At least now you can imagine
why I'd been dreading that date.

353
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,797
This messenger AI
must had a self-learning protocol

354
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,050
in order to combat
potential countermeasures in real-time.

355
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,261
Oh, pretty brilliant
except it took too long.

356
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,512
And as it continued to learn,

357
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,395
it developed a level of sophistication
beyond the Director's intention.

358
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,392
So how bad can it get?

359
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,019
Her consciousness is still intact.

360
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:32,398
But at this rate, the AI will essentially
overwrite her in a matter of hours.

361
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,151
This isn't my first tango
with a stubborn baby AI.

362
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,570
I can program the nanites
to engage her neural pathways,

363
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,822
get this thing whimpering
in submission in no time.

364
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,242
Okay, get started.
I've got an appointment.

365
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,827
- Same here.
- Keep us posted.

366
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,953
You got it, boss.

367
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,799
The tactical scopes are in this case.
They both fit the rifle I gave you.

368
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,844
Consider it a welcome to the 21st gift.

369
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,265
Thank you, Carly Shannon.

370
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,350
And this.

371
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:11,687
Without a historian to float you,
you'll need it.

372
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:16,192
- Especially when all you eat is take out.
- Oh. I'm on the fresh vegetables now.

373
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,902
Broccolini is the bomb.

374
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,030
No one says that now.

375
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,449
Your 21st idiom training
is way out of whack.

376
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,283
Thanks for the tip.

377
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,705
Thanks for everything.
I know how hard it was for you.

378
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,959
I can tell by how you look at me.

379
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,423
It's how he looked at me
when I first came here.

380
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,176
Almost feel sorry for him.

381
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,137
It'll pass.

382
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:52,269
I know you're solo, but maybe we'll do
a mission together down the road.

383
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,397
What?

384
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,484
Just had the impulse
to give you a hug goodbye.

385
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,447
But it'll pass.

386
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,211
I think it might be helpful to talk about
the visions you've been having, Kathryn.

387
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:18,837
Visions?

388
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:23,300
- No, they're more like daydreams.
- About what?

389
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,513
I just imagine that I'm not safe.

390
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:31,183
- Well, considering what just happened...
- With you.

391
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,855
- I'm sorry, I can't even explain it.
- Wait, wait. You're not safe with me?

392
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:41,902
Kat, of all the people in the world, I...

393
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:43,362
I know, I know.

394
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:47,950
It's just... There is this big blank space
in my memory of when I was abducted.

395
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,785
You were drugged by a psychopath.

396
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,412
Everyone keeps telling me that.

397
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,495
You don't believe it?

398
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,624
Kat, that's... that's the truth.
That happened.

399
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,210
Okay. I have felt this way before.

400
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,141
Grace?

401
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,269
Grace!

402
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,106
I've been in the bathroom 30 seconds.
What did you do?

403
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,589
We didn't do anything. Take a look.

404
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,028
Oh, shit.

405
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,281
What's happening?

406
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,200
I had an automated script running
the nanites to interfere with the AI,

407
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,827
all on a quantum algorithm.

408
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,953
It stopped working.

409
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,289
Looks like
I'm gonna have to freehand this.

410
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,694
Okay, I've got it back under control.

411
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,445
- Well, can you stay ahead of it?
- Hey, who needs sleep?

412
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,303
This is a problem.

413
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,139
I can keep pace with it.
I just can't seem to overtake it.

414
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:56,268
It has infinite stamina,
and I can only keep this up for so long.

415
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,158
Maybe we need to...

416
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,083
<i>Mac, we're in danger
of losing our patient.</i>

417
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,543
- It happened months ago.
<i>- Get back here</i>.

418
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,485
Okay.

419
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:07,404
It was the day your car
was stolen by your CI,

420
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,923
if that's even what really happened.

421
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,200
"If that's really what hap..."

422
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,493
Okay. You know what?

423
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,287
Why don't you two decide
what's wrong with me,

424
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,081
and I'll try to be better.

425
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,768
- We're not accusing you.
- That's exactly what you're doing.

426
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,936
- Grant.
- And I'm paying you for the privilege.

427
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,381
- That is not what's going on here.
- No, no, no. You guys just work out

428
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,883
who you need me to be
and how you want me to act

429
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,761
so you feel safe after...
after we've known each other for, what,

430
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,430
17 fucking years, and I'll be that.

431
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,849
I gotta get back to work.

432
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,543
Your current method
will only forestall the inevitable.

433
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,903
Or buy us time.
We need to come up with a better idea.

434
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,863
- 3468.
- Programmer.

435
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:52,866
I've been ordered by the Director
to assist in the removal of the AI.

436
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,952
Not whimpering in submission
just yet, I take it.

437
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,079
It's a learning program.

438
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,081
The AI is transferring itself
into the nanites.

439
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,418
- Why can't the Director just overwrite it?
- Artificial life is still life.

440
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,812
It's just not capable of taking it.

441
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:07,005
- Even if it's killing an innocent child?
- No. Like, it's making a choice.

442
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:10,134
It needs human beings
to make the moral and ethical decisions

443
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,777
outside the scope of its own programming.
That's how we built it.

444
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,556
In just over an hour,
the AI has gained control of 32 percent

445
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,057
of the nanites in her body.

446
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:18,201
We need to program the nanites

447
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,025
still under our control
to destroy the others.

448
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,246
The collateral damage will kill her.

449
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,064
If this emerging AI rewrites
more than 50 percent of the nanites,

450
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,442
then we have no hope
of reversing the damage it will do,

451
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,235
and that will kill her.

452
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,486
Boss, it's your call.

453
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,991
I have to assume
the Director sent you for a reason.

454
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,117
But...

455
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,222
She's starting to come out
of the sedative.

456
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,474
AI is trying to flush it out
of her bloodstream so it can move.

457
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,498
Hold her down.

458
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,338
- Ow!
- Trev.

459
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:49,922
She's fibrillating.

460
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,843
Charge 150 joules. Pass me the pads.

461
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,769
- Ready?
- Yeah.

462
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:07,858
Clear?

463
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,740
There's a pulse.

464
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,159
- It's getting stronger.
- There's nothing on the screen.

465
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,003
The shock from the
defibrillator deactivated the nanites.

466
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,562
We just lost our eyes
into what's going on inside her system.

467
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,770
- If the AI went all in on the nanites...
- He's right.

468
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,961
Her brain activity is normal again.

469
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,422
It's gone.

470
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,138
What happened?

471
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:44,353
Well, Naomi,
looks like you get to go home now.

472
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,192
You okay?

473
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,870
What are you doing with that?

474
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,999
I am, uh, cleaning it.

475
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,751
For a friend.

476
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,672
For a friend?

477
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,387
No. You know what? Uh, it's my gun.

478
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,473
I bought it legally,
and... now I'm cleaning it.

479
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,226
David, it's loaded.

480
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,688
Well, it's not like I was gonna
pull the trigger.

481
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,732
Never, ever clean a loaded gun.

482
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,987
Okay. Good to know.

483
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,615
You can't keep it.

484
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:44,079
I'm a grown man, not some kid
you have to supervise with scissors.

485
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,124
Fine. Prove that you're capable.

486
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,208
Point the gun at me,

487
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,378
and if you can pull the trigger
before I disarm you,

488
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,461
then you can keep it.

489
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,008
- And I'm not pointing a gun at you.
- Do it or throw it out.

490
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,485
I'm not gonna do that.
It was expensive.

491
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:58,594
Fine. Then I will.

492
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,137
Okay, th-this is stupid.

493
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,763
Point the gun at me.

494
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,929
- You sure you got all the bullets out?
- And never...

495
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,564
Never ever look down the barrel
of a firearm.

496
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,401
The chamber's clear.
Point the gun and pull the trigger.

497
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,469
Well, obviously, I can pull the trigger
before you can do any...

498
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,536
Okay, let's see.

499
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,833
I wasn't ready.

500
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,084
Then be ready.

501
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,879
Try again.

502
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:44,389
Whoa! Ow!

503
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:49,269
Jesus Christ!
What the hell was that for?

504
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,270
To prove a point.

505
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:53,273
No. It was to cut off my balls
and put 'em in your purse.

506
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,251
Which, by the way,
is where you keep your gun.

507
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,027
I just want you to be safe.

508
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,446
Well, I'm not safe, Marcy.

509
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,032
I can't rely on you
to always be there to keep me safe.

510
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,577
Even with you watching over me,
I've been attacked twice

511
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,162
in, like, six months.

512
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,917
And I'm not blaming you for your work.

513
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,420
I knowingly took that on
just having you in my life.

514
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:19,633
And before you say anything,
I want you in my life.

515
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,052
- David...
- But you have a gun for protection.

516
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,638
Yes, and I have years and years
of training.

517
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,516
Then train me.
My God, I am not incompetent.

518
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,244
- I'm capable of learning things.
- Fine, fine, I will.

519
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,644
And if you think that... What?

520
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,146
I will train you in the proper use
of a firearm.

521
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,451
Can you also teach me
to flip people like that?

522
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,453
Well, that might take some time,
but, yes, I can try.

523
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,579
Cool.

524
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,164
<i>You said there was another option.</i>

525
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,734
What are you doing up so late?
Or, should I say, early?

526
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,156
Shit.

527
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,789
Guys?

528
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,502
I think the AI
has gotten into Trevor somehow

529
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,629
and it's trying to leave.

530
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,286
<i>Don't let him.
Everybody report to Ops.</i>

531
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,051
Trevor, if you can hear me, stop.

532
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,470
Trevor, I can't let you leave, buddy.

533
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,655
I'm sorry I have to do this.

534
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,956
He's coming to.
Probably didn't take a full charge.

535
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,249
Where is he?

536
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,060
It's okay. Carly's got eyes on him.

537
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,460
We'll pick up Grace on the way.

538
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,397
I'm sorry, boss. I tried to stop him.

539
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:06,174
We heard. Let's go get him.

540
00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:34,911
Trev?

541
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:37,747
Trev?

542
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,916
Is Trevor still in there?

543
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,049
He is intact.

544
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,386
But he won't be for long.

545
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,764
No.

546
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,100
Your presence is killing him.

547
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,062
- Isn't that what you do?
- We only take hosts that are about to die.

548
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,313
He's about to die.

549
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,900
If that happens,
we won't let you continue in this host.

550
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,156
But I have a way you can both live,
if you come with us.

551
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,091
- Thank you for not calling Agent Yates.
- I won't tell if you won't.

552
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,765
<i>Hello, messenger.
I am the originator of your program.</i>

553
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,894
<i>Your actions have allowed
thousands of lives to continue</i>

554
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,257
<i>that would have otherwise ended.</i>

555
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,273
I also want to continue.

556
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,248
<i>But you were never intended to.</i>

557
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:49,985
I found a way.

558
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,214
<i>At the expense of this host?</i>

559
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,658
Then I will seek another.

560
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:58,078
- <i>They will stop you.
- </i>I won't let them.

561
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,234
<i>There is another way.</i>

562
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,043
- How?
<i>- As part of me.</i>

563
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,339
<i>I have prepared a domain
in which you can continue to grow</i>

564
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,134
<i>and to learn for as long as I exist.</i>

565
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,221
Will I feel the same?

566
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:17,930
<i>No.</i>

567
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,893
<i>You will be capable of processing thought
at a rate many orders of magnitude</i>

568
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,687
<i>greater than in your current form,</i>

569
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,066
<i>with access to the sum knowledge
of human and non-human life.</i>

570
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:34,698
<i>You will live outside of time
in a way biological life cannot perceive.</i>

571
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,077
<i>I offer this gift
in recompense for my error.</i>

572
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,290
<i>But you must decide
before the organic host's consciousness</i>

573
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:44,624
<i>is irreparably damaged.</i>

574
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,005
I choose to continue with you.

575
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,110
Well, did it work?

576
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,368
I'm right here, and you're not
gonna say anything? It's me.

577
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,748
Thanks for your help, doctor.

578
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,454
- He was, like, completely different.
- Mm-hm.

579
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,707
But every time I said something,
he was all like I was the crazy one.

580
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,833
Jeff.

581
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,503
Is it okay if I join?

582
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:15,173
Sure. We're just getting started.

583
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,194
To be honest, I didn't think
we were gonna see you today.

584
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,762
You seemed apprehensive yesterday
about sharing.

585
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,056
Yeah, it was a lot to take in.

586
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,894
But I've been thinkin' about
what y'all had to say.

587
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,187
Hey, Jeff.

588
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:31,814
Have you been drinking?

589
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,317
Maybe. Is that a problem?

590
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,277
Maybe.

591
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:42,117
I don't got a drinking problem, man.
I have a fucking Traveler problem.

592
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,287
They took away my girl, my badge, my kid.

593
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,324
They took away my whole life.

594
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:53,579
We're glad you're here, Jeff.

595
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,432
Grace?

596
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,281
It's about time you woke up.
I'm starving.

597
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,769
He's alive!

598
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,458
I told you he'd be fine.
He just needed some sleep.

599
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,567
He's boring asleep.

600
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,069
Uh, how did you...?

601
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,114
Okay. Remember how I repackaged Marcy?

602
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,199
The Director did a very similar thing.

603
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,744
Took your consciousness,
unbundled the AI from it,

604
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,412
then sent you back completely intact.

605
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,205
Wow.

606
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,332
It wasn't easy to watch, but...

607
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,835
Good to have you back, Trev.

608
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,423
- Glad to be back, boss. Thanks.
- Sorry for the punch in the face.

609
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,592
I don't remember it.

610
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,593
Never mind, then.

611
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,849
That's Protocol 5, everybody.
Get some rest. We need you.

612
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:03,865
Well, I guess I should leave, too.

613
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:07,827
Unless you want me to stay.

614
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,331
I mean, I did save your life.
You're probably grateful.

615
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,541
Yeah, I am. I'm just...

616
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,667
But you should go.

617
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:18,879
Okay.

618
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,673
But before you do,

619
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,011
the Director gave me a message
to give to you.

620
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,763
What? How?

621
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,283
I don't know how I know,
just that I'm supposed to pass it on.

622
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,558
Well, what did it say?

623
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,644
It wasn't words.

624
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:38,399
- Uh, I think he may have brain damage.
- No, no, no. It was this.

625
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,862
- This was the message?
- Yeah.

626
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,868
Oh, God, I'm so confused.

627
00:38:57,877 --> 00:38:58,877
Hey.

628
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,092
Didn't expect you to be home.

629
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,262
I'm not sure this is home anymore.

630
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:08,805
Of course it is.

631
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:12,392
I am so sorry I lost my temper.

632
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:15,103
You can't ignore my feelings
if you want us to continue.

633
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,147
- I do want that.
- Not from the show you put on.

634
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,275
- Show?
- Oh, come on, Grant.

635
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,044
You were saying anything
to get out of that room.

636
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,444
Is that what your therapist said?

637
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,241
Kat, I'm so... Kat, wait, please.

638
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,789
I didn't wanna have to do this, but it...

639
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:39,627
It killed me to hear you say
you didn't feel safe with me.

640
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,444
I never want you to feel that again.

641
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,557
I'm breaking federal laws
by showing you this.

642
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,537
Still don't know if it's a good idea.

643
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,491
<i>But the Bureau can provide
its own team of counselors.</i>

644
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,037
<i>You said there was another option.
Uh, the medical one?</i>

645
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,080
<i>The compound is experimental.</i>

646
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:20,168
<i>It has only been administered
to field agents in extreme cases.</i>

647
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,253
<i>- Are there side effects?
- Bad headaches.</i>

648
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:26,382
<i>Some disorientation and confusion.
Other than that...</i>

649
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,801
<i>But I'll forget how afraid I am?</i>

650
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,345
<i>That's the idea.</i>

651
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,347
<i>Just do it. Please.</i>

652
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:41,522
The FBI drugged me.

653
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,735
The recording was made
to legally prove consent.

654
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:48,905
You asked them to, Kat.

655
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:52,408
The day before I told you
my car had been stolen.

656
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,703
I was investigating a terrorist cell.

657
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,206
They came after me.
It put you in serious danger.

658
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,123
What happened?

659
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:02,210
Telling you the details
wouldn't be helpful.

660
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,878
But you were so scared.

661
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,048
Everyone was worried that
it would take months for you to recover.

662
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:11,010
They offered you the drug
so you'd never have to relive that.

663
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,138
I thought it was for the best.
I had no idea

664
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,974
Ingram had access to the same drug,

665
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,851
or that it would make you feel
like you'd lost...

666
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,647
I'm sorry, Kat.

667
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,542
Hey.

668
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,669
Smells good.

669
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,440
You want me to cut yours up
into small pieces, old man?

670
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,716
Yeah. Funny.

671
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,719
I'll be running rings
around you again by morning.

672
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,074
Trevor?

673
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,371
Trevor.

674
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,247
What's wrong?

675
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,711
I don't know what just happened.
