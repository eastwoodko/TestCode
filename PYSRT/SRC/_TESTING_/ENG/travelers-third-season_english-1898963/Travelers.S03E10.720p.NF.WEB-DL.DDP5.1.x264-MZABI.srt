1
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,929
<i>Come on.</i>

2
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:16,558
You're having fun with this one?

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,809
Okay.

4
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:24,233
And then he... he very quickly realizes
that the cup is nowhere near big enough,

5
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,109
but he can't stop at this point.

6
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,070
And so there he is, he's stuck in traffic,

7
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,615
and he's peeing into a coffee cup.

8
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:36,411
And the level is slowly rising.

9
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,833
<i>...continue to search for answers</i>

10
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,752
<i>in the wake of the worst nuclear attack
in history,</i>

11
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,755
<i>which shook the lives of hundreds
of thousands of people on Tuesday.</i>

12
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,967
<i>There's been no information as to
which terrorist group is responsible...</i>

13
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:57,826
Thanks.

14
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,165
- Shit's gotten pretty crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

15
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:07,919
Always figured Omega was the one protocol
we'd never have to worry about.

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,174
When you consider the amount
of potential revisions

17
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,967
and possible outcomes,

18
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,137
the Director's probably abandoned
millions of timelines.

19
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,260
Good chance there's a version of us
in most of them.

20
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,727
- Yeah, but I live in this one, so...
- Yeah.

21
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,354
Yeah.

22
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,651
What's that thing stuck to your head?

23
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:32,527
Brain implant.

24
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,948
- For?
- Temporal aphasia. Early onset.

25
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,241
Cool.

26
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,164
We'll file the missing person's report
in 24 hours.

27
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,833
It will have been given by 3569
after she's gone home.

28
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,652
He didn't come home from work.
That's all she needs to know.

29
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,219
- We'll take care of the rest.
- I'll tell her.

30
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,437
They'll blame us, you know that.

31
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,899
I'm surprised Yates hasn't called already.

32
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,026
I should probably go into the office.

33
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:16,488
- Can you tell her it was Faction?
- I did.

34
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,242
But after this,
they're never gonna trust a word we say.

35
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,078
Yeah. After this,
I'm not sure I blame them.

36
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,972
Yeah, I still get locked in
once in a while.

37
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,542
The device is just a temporary solution.
There's no cure even in the future.

38
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,253
Switch hosts enough times,
it becomes inevitable.

39
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,548
- So you've switched hosts that many times?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,467
I was an early test subject
for consciousness transfer.

41
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,304
So, you're like really old, then.

42
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,682
Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty fucking old.

43
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,859
I'm not even sure
what I'm supposed to do now.

44
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,771
What do you mean?

45
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,899
I'm a cop? That's it?

46
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:55,527
It was fine as Protocol 5,
but I'm a doctor.

47
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,155
- We still have a mission.
- Do we?

48
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,366
Maybe the Director
abandoned this timeline,

49
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,826
but that doesn't mean we have to.

50
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,495
We can't just go around making up
our own missions.

51
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,580
Why not?

52
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,374
Because it would make us no different
than the Faction.

53
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,420
Then we still have a mission to complete.
Find 001.

54
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,840
And how are we supposed to do that?
He could've jumped into anyone by now.

55
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,718
- Without the Director's help...
- I don't know. I just...

56
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,637
We... We have to try.

57
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,558
I'm gonna take off now.

58
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,810
You're bleeding.

59
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,690
- Mm, shit.
- Here.

60
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,651
- I can bandage you up.
- No, no, no.

61
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,070
- Y-You don't gotta.
- Just come here.

62
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,238
Come here.

63
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,631
What?

64
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,304
I'm just so sorry, that's all.

65
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,266
Can I ask you something?

66
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,937
Whatever. Sure.

67
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,233
The future hasn't gotten any better,
has it?

68
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:21,238
- Protocol 2, Marcy.
- Protocol Omega, Jeff.

69
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,532
Truth?

70
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,787
Nothing the Director's done
has made one bit of difference.

71
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,057
But I still think that we can change that.

72
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:40,298
Hey, how about if I finish up? Yeah?

73
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,801
Okay.

74
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,852
- Where you headed?
- Home.

75
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,273
- I'll give you a lift.
- No. You're just gonna wanna talk.

76
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,985
- It's good to talk.
- I already know what you're gonna say

77
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,948
because I've been trained
to say the same thing.

78
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,907
And you'll feel better because we're told
that it helps people, but it doesn't.

79
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,284
- Marcy.
- David...

80
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:13,999
David was the kind of man
who made humanity worth saving. He...

81
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,960
He literally represented that.

82
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,424
And he's a better human being
than every fucking person in this room.

83
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,095
And the Director did nothing
to save him.

84
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,889
So I'm done.

85
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,733
You want me to go after her,
make sure she gets home okay?

86
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,237
No. Let her go.

87
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,410
Agent MacLaren.

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,163
Officer Conniker.

89
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,333
- Thank you for the rescue.
- You stay in touch.

90
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,127
I will.

91
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,847
Sir...

92
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:14,535
I have reason to believe
that yesterday's attacks

93
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,186
were not caused by the Travelers.

94
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,664
Well, then I have reason to believe
you're one of them.

95
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,857
There is a resistance group
called the Faction.

96
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,776
Oh, I know all about the Faction,
believe me.

97
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,653
That is their political distinction.

98
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,464
It doesn't change the fact
that the uranium used

99
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,031
in every single one of those nukes

100
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,034
had just been traced back
to the exact same mine in this country.

101
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,371
I was there with Agent MacLaren
and his team

102
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,997
when he disarmed the fourth device.

103
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:38,917
Okay, so we're supposed to convince
the Russians and the Chinese

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,586
that although every one of the nukes
that went off yesterday

105
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:42,879
has been traced back to us,

106
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:46,216
the one that was successfully disarmed
just happened to be on U.S. soil?

107
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,894
'Cause the good Travelers saved us
from the bad Travelers, is that it?

108
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,721
Does that sound like
a compelling argument?

109
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,099
No.

110
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,622
Every one of the groups we're monitoring
keeps saying the same thing.

111
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,022
"Protocol Omega." What is it?

112
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,111
- I'll ask MacLaren.
- Find another way. I don't trust them.

113
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:07,988
Get it right, please.

114
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,448
Right now, we're one nervous general away
from nuclear war.

115
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,060
Do you ever think about
what you would've done

116
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,461
if you hadn't volunteered
for the Traveler program?

117
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,341
No. Never saw myself doing anything else.

118
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,718
Yeah, me, too.

119
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:34,931
But I'm not sure
I'd make the same decision,

120
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,016
knowing what I know.

121
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,977
- There was another option?
- Yeah. Life.

122
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:44,149
Life not solely devoted
to training and combat.

123
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,485
Life without Protocol 4.

124
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,281
Stuck in domes,
heated by a failing reactor,

125
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,324
on a diet of yeast and recycled water?

126
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,077
We were barely clinging to life, Carly,
not living it.

127
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,164
Yeah, well, tell that
to my mother and sisters.

128
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,876
They still found a way to laugh every day,

129
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:08,048
fall in love, make families.

130
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,178
Hey, at least you still got your wife
to go home to.

131
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,672
Traveler team report
to the following coordinates immediately:

132
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:33,823
47.2531 degrees north,
122.4523 degrees west.

133
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,162
What the hell was that?

134
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,247
One way to find out.

135
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,832
- You can't be serious.
- Why not?

136
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,269
You know for a fact that that message
wasn't from the Director.

137
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,979
It's obviously a trap
set up by the Faction.

138
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,922
And if the Faction is working with 001?

139
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,799
Then we're the next ones
behind a brick wall.

140
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,175
We'll take precautions.

141
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,806
Carly, what the hell else
are we supposed to do?

142
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,638
Literally anything else.

143
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,099
We can do whatever we want.

144
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,685
I can't order you to go with me,
but I'm going.

145
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,751
Trevor, are you there?

146
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,484
I could use your help.

147
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,592
<i>Coverage continues today

148
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,744

149

- Yeah, bud?

153
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,332
Where's Marcy?

154
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,418
She left a while ago.
It's just you and me.

155
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,631
So, Marcy went home?

156
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,093
Why don't we meditate for 20 minutes?
Clear our heads.

157
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,343
<i>Hi, this is David Mailer.
Please leave a message.</i>

158
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,254
Hey, taxi!

159
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,915
Marcy?

160
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,385
Oh, my God.

161
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,946
Philip, what are you doing here?

162
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,866
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,368
Okay, just...

164
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,212
Go into the living room.
I'll be right there.

165
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,617
<i>Carly, you got anything?</i>

166
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,678
Nothing yet.

167
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:10,641
Hold up.
One man walking out from the boat.

168
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:16,355
Agent MacLaren.
I'm pleased you were able to make it.

169
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,398
Okay.

170
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:30,244
Do the names "Vincent Ingram"
or "Katrina Perrow" mean anything to you?

171
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,624
Just wanna have a conversation.

172
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,292
Oh, you better start talking

173
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,504
'cause you've got about ten seconds
before I order your head blown off.

174
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,715
- I wanna cut a deal.
- Eight seconds.

175
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,302
I will turn myself in to the Director
and face the consequences

176
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,972
if you will fill me in on the details
of Protocol Omega.

177
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,600
Fill you in?

178
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,189
It was not a protocol
in the time I was sent back.

179
00:14:58,648 --> 00:14:59,774
Really?

180
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,766
That's what you're going with?

181
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,698
Yates, is this you?

182
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:19,210
- How did you know?
- Seriously?

183
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:22,755
Why didn't you just give him an eye patch
and a cat to stroke?

184
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,815
I need you to come talk to my superiors.

185
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,052
They're my superiors, too.
Why not just text me?

186
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:31,973
Because they don't trust you.
Three nuclear devices just went off.

187
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:35,476
And you watched us disarm the fourth.
How could you possibly...?

188
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,479
You know what? Fine. Let's go.

189
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,608
- All of them. Including the sniper.
- Uh, no.

190
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,320
Carly, you and Trevor head back in my car.
This won't take long.

191
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:47,737
Copy that.

192
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,577
Happy to go with, boss.

193
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,038
This is my Protocol 5, remember?

194
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,083
Okay, fine.

195
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,801
- Who did you get to play the messenger?
- Johanson's kid.

196
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,636
Wants to be an actress.

197
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,346
She's good.

198
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,458
<i>So I would recommend
not doing this to someone.</i>

199
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,069
<i>But make a claw
with your left hand, like this.</i>

200
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,006
And then so when you come down...

201
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,032
- Oh! Shit.
- Oh.

202
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,326
Ah.

203
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,221
Now you can't expect beginner's luck
to last.

204
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:37,245
- Gin.
- I didn't...

205
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,143
That's your shirt.

206
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,567
- Ah, well, rules are rules. All right.
- That's your shirt.

207
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,878
Oh, man.

208
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,713
Whoo.

209
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,632
- Aw.
- Right?

210
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,452
- All right, one more round and then...
- Okay. Keep going.

211
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,156
Philip.

212
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:16,661
Hey, Philip. Hey.

213
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:18,787
Hey.

214
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,924
You saw something
in the bathroom, didn't you?

215
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:31,968
I would never do that.
You know that, right?

216
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,346
I don't really.

217
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,951
I know you don't wanna rely on the drugs,
but if those pills are helping,

218
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,435
- you need to keep taking them.
- I can't. I threw them away.

219
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,856
And only an archivist can give me more.

220
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,113
Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.

221
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,491
Hey, please...
please take care of yourself.

222
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:58,952
Yeah.

223
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,923
David was a really good guy.

224
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,262
Excuse me, what are you doing in...?

225
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:14,987
What are you doing?

226
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,406
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

227
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,077
Carly!

228
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,139
Renovations?

229
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,642
- Everything needs to be hard-wired.
- Because?

230
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,977
We've built our version
of what you call an S.T.A.,

231
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,313
Space Time Attenuation field generator.

232
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,191
I'm told it'll make it impossible
for the Director to see us.

233
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,944
It's under guard on the floor below

234
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,630
if you're thinking of looking
for the off switch.

235
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,614
That precaution really wasn't necessary.

236
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,539
Director Stevenson,
it's an honor to meet you.

237
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,203
Turn off your comm device.

238
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,371
My comm?

239
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,375
Okay.

240
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,961
- It's off.
- Good.

241
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,843
Jesus! Okay, okay, okay.

242
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,302
It's off.

243
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,639
Give me one reason
I shouldn't round up every one of you.

244
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:29,103
The nuclear devices were built
by the Faction. They're still out there.

245
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,897
Protocol Omega, what does it mean?

246
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,526
It means the Director will no longer be
intervening in this timeline.

247
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,404
- What does that mean?
- No more messengers, no more missions.

248
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,383
Those who are part of the Traveler program
are free to live out their days,

249
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,492
such as they are, as they see fit.

250
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,221
- Why would the Director do that?
- It's impossible to say for sure.

251
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,455
Venture a guess.

252
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,290
It could mean that we've succeeded

253
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,001
and we're now on the optimal path
to a better future.

254
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,563
It could also mean there's no possible way
of saving the future

255
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,755
no matter what you do.

256
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,215
That's true.

257
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,979
Why should we believe a word
you're saying?

258
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,996
That's your call, sir.

259
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,306
But I'm willing to help in any way I can

260
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,768
and I'll tell you anything you wanna know.

261
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,544
Jeff.

262
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,340
Hey, just wanna check in on you,

263
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,883
see how's it going.

264
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,969
I brought you something.

265
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,183
It's water flavoring made of leaves.
You just add boiling water.

266
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,102
Yeah, yeah, I know what tea is.

267
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,991
I've developed
quite a taste for it myself.

268
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,313
Hmm.

269
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,736
Uh, do you wanna come in
and have a cup with me?

270
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,863
If... If that would be cool.

271
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,027
- But I don't wanna...
- Come on. Come in.

272
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,251
Take a seat.

273
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,432
Looks like you've been doing
some cleaning.

274
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,589
Yeah, just trying to keep busy.

275
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,677
I'll be okay.
I just need some time, you know?

276
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,596
Time, yes.

277
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,308
Don't we all?

278
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,690
I know what you've been through, Marcy.

279
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:40,859
You do?

280
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,446
Well, not everything.

281
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,200
I can't imagine
what it must have been like for you,

282
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:52,079
to go through your reset,
to lose all those memories.

283
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,378
The Director took my wife from me, too.

284
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:03,340
You mean your... your wife in the future.

285
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:05,884
Death by messenger.

286
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,344
Just like David.

287
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,685
Precious life,
snuffed out right before my eyes.

288
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,316
But we have no right to complain.

289
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,152
We forfeited that right

290
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:29,033
when we made the decision to put our fate
in the hands of a machine.

291
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,163
Um, I'm sorry you went through all that.

292
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,917
Is another reset possible, I wonder?

293
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,507
Is Ellis's backdoor code to the Director

294
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,260
still buried in there somewhere?

295
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:51,555
I don't think so.

296
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,515
Oh, I think so.

297
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,517
I really do.

298
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:07,488
Anyway, it's... it's just good to see you
whole again, Marcy.

299
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,158
I should get that.

300
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,950
Let me help you.

301
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,338
Guys!

302
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,049
<i>001 went into Jeff!</i>

303
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,012
<i>He's after Ellis's backdoor code.
He thinks... He thinks it's in my head.</i>

304
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,638
Guys, I need your help!

305
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,605
Marcy?

306
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,732
<i>Mac, Trevor? Can anyone here me?</i>

307
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:47,236
Sorry, I must've got locked in for a sec.

308
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,698
I didn't catch it all,
but Marcy's in trouble.

309
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:51,948
Meet me at her place.

310
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,037
Ah!

311
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:37,536
Ugh. Mac, I have 001.

312
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,497
The gun isn't loaded, Marcy.

313
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,337
I could never risk
what's in that pretty little head.

314
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,214
Ugh.

315
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,509
Take her.

316
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:37,304
It's the end of the world, brother.
We're all gonna die now.

317
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:03,539
Before I agree to let you do anything,
I wanna know about the future.

318
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,911
I can only tell you
about the time I left.

319
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,293
It's changed because you changed history.

320
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,129
Not necessarily for the better.

321
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:14,776
From what little I've heard,
even after all we've done,

322
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,010
humanity is still on the brink
of extinction.

323
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,388
A more recent Traveler
might be able to tell you more.

324
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:23,725
Just tell me the history you remember.
What went wrong?

325
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:28,564
The decline took years,
but this decade was the turning point.

326
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,944
Once climate change became unstoppable,
it led to mass migration,

327
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,364
severe overpopulation
in urban centers, famine.

328
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:40,284
Ancient diseases became unlocked
as polar ice melted,

329
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:44,037
which exposed humanity to viruses
for which we had no immunity.

330
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:49,001
That led to mass death,
collapse of governments, resources,

331
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,086
war over what was left.

332
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,548
Eventually, nuclear winter.

333
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,053
How the hell
were you supposed to stop all that?

334
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,596
Our primary mission

335
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,141
was to prevent a massive asteroid strike
in the Atlantic.

336
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,224
Helios.

337
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:11,732
When an x-ray laser's fired toward
a previously undiscovered asteroid

338
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,859
from within the continental United States,

339
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,611
now that tends not to go unnoticed.

340
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:19,239
We should prove our good intentions.
Helios killed millions.

341
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,950
The Grand Plan
was supposed to erase all that.

342
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,703
- Why didn't it work?
- I honestly can't answer that.

343
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,622
Only that the Director kept trying.

344
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,873
Till today.

345
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,423
Agent MacLaren, today, this country's
been accused by my counterparts

346
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,717
in Russia, China, even by our allies,

347
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,386
of detonating nuclear devices
on their soil.

348
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,347
I told you that was the Faction.

349
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,759
- They don't know that.
- Well, then let me tell them.

350
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,518
Let me tell them everything.
We can still fix this.

351
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,607
I can reach out.
We'll need to arrange translators.

352
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,651
That won't be necessary.

353
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:07,120
Carly, I'm at the apartment.

354
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,831
<i>I'm still a few minutes out.
Is she there?</i>

355
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,001
No. And the place is trashed.

356
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,420
<i>Oh, God. Marcy, can you hear me?</i>

357
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,630
Say that again.

358
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,842
<i>Come in, Marcy. Marcy, you there?</i>

359
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
Ah, shit.

360
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,060
I found her comm. It's been cut out.

361
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:31,852
<i>He's taken her.</i>

362
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,316
You said you didn't catch it all.
What did you hear her say?

363
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,944
<i>Something about
Ellis's backdoor code.</i>

364
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,316
What good is the code
without access to the Director?

365
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:45,659
Boss, we got a problem.

366
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,246
Philip, Mac's turned off his comm.

367
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,330
Okay, I'm close to his house.
I'll try to find him.

368
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:54,746
Carly, meet me out front.
I know where they're going.

369
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,464
Marcy, I'm sorry.

370
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:03,010
I thought the Director would stop them.
They drugged me.

371
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,971
Grace, what did you tell them?

372
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
Boss, are you here?

373
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:10,142
Oh, okay.

374
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,937
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh.

375
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,108
That's good, huh?

376
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,380
Uh, I'm... I'm gonna...

377
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,884
I'm just gonna... gonna go.

378
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,978
<i>What is the number
of Travelers in my country?</i>

379
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:59,941
Each Traveler team
is forbidden by our protocols

380
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,865
to communicate with each other
unless directed.

381
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:05,655
<i>We have captured
several Traveler cells in Russia.</i>

382
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,867
<i>They told us this Faction originated
in the United States.</i>

383
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,997
They first came en masse
from the future to the U.S., yes,

384
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:18,377
but they have since spread out
to many countries.

385
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,860
<i>Having consolidated
their power in your country.</i>

386
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,133
- My team is on their way.
- Protocol Omega.

387
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:28,303
Why do you think
that this code is still in my head?

388
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:32,099
Actually, Grace told me.

389
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,702
Even told me how to use it
to hack the Director.

390
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,105
- I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- What if she's wrong?

391
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,291
Then nothing happens,
and I'm disappointed.

392
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,068
But if she's right,
the Director becomes permanently disabled

393
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,404
and the future belongs to humanity.

394
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,614
- Oh, you mean the Faction?
- Yes.

395
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,784
- Led by you?
- So I'm told.

396
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:56,206
This reset will take away
all those painful memories, Marcy.

397
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:59,835
Memories of who I am now.

398
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,296
The Director allowed the man
that you love to die horribly

399
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,965
when it could have saved him.

400
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,925
How can you forgive that?

401
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,482
By doing this,
we'll both get what we want.

402
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,898
All right, let's get this over with.

403
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,445
Don't shoot her!

404
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,617
You want what's in my head?

405
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,703
You can't have it.

406
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,706
No!

407
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,530
The other way
is gonna take so much longer.

408
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,578
Travelers will cooperate, I promise you.

409
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,514
We can even help find members
of the Faction

410
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,998
responsible for the nuclear devices.

411
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,709
<i>Then will you share
your advanced technologies?</i>

412
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,922
Our engineers have been creating materials
and... and building devices for a decade.

413
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,633
I think if our technology
is shared equitably, we...

414
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,885
Sir, we're making progress.

415
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,613
This isn't the time
to be negotiating access

416
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,317
to future technologies
with foreign powers.

417
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,641
If we're to trust each other, we...

418
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,937
- What is happening?
- They're being overwritten.

419
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,397
- The Director's not doing this...
- Then who is?

420
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:46,250
I don't know. But it's impossible...

421
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,151
...for the Director to take life
in that way.

422
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,235
Stevenson.

423
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,780
When did this happen?

424
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:57,202
All right, keep me up to date.

425
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,330
The president and most of his cabinet
just screamed in pain and collapsed.

426
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,705
Oh, my God.

427
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,543
They all claim to be fine now.
This happened to the Speaker as well.

428
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,418
This is a coup.

429
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,798
I need to get back to Washington.
Arrest this son of a bitch.

430
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,424
Put your hands on your head.

431
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:12,968
- Jo, you gotta believe me.
- Now!

432
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,575
- Listen to me.
- Shut the fuck up.

433
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,418
The same thing
that happened to the president

434
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,121
is probably happening
to other world leaders right now.

435
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,204
Let me help you.

436
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:55,302
I need to talk to my team.

437
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,907
<i>Guys, it's me,
what's happening?</i>

438
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,476
Where the fuck have you been?
001's taken Jeff as a host.

439
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:04,977
No.

440
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,420
<i>The rescue was just a set up
to get access to Marcy.</i>

441
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,481
Why Marcy?

442
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,318
<i>So he could use Ellis's
backdoor code against the Director.</i>

443
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,905
- Through Ilsa. He's taken her to Filmore.
- Yeah, that's our guess, too.

444
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,342
- We're almost there.
<i>- Boss, I could use a pick up.</i>

445
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,327
Okay, I'll get you on the way.

446
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,620
You're not going anywhere.

447
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,891
Guys, am I the only one seeing this?

448
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,853
No. We see it, too.

449
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,274
You need to get out.

450
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,063
I have to go see my son.
Filmore's not far from here.

451
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,779
Carly, there isn't much time.

452
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,156
I know. Go.

453
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,458
Boss, Carly's out.

454
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,418
Protocol Omega. I'll meet you at Filmore.

455
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,096
Yes, ma'am.

456
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,267
I'll try and get the Director
to safety.

457
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,355
NORAD's detected a massive missile strike

458
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,692
from both Russia and China.

459
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:35,267
Tell me why this is happening.

460
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,488
The first ever Traveler 001
has taken over in the future.

461
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,656
Don't ask me how.

462
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,116
- He launched the missiles?
- No.

463
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,119
That would likely be the generals
following standing orders to launch

464
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,971
in the event their leadership
was overwritten.

465
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,539
But he is still the cause.

466
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,124
NORAD said we were targeted.

467
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,542
Jo,

468
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:56,172
you can either come with me
or you can shoot me in the back.

469
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,633
Bye, Marce.

470
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,636
I'm sorry.

471
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,139
Trevor! What are you doing?

472
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:14,918
001 must have uploaded
his consciousness into Ilsa.

473
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,669
No, he's not in there.

474
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,756
Grace.

475
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,340
Grace, hey.

476
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:26,888
He wasn't able to use
the backdoor code either.

477
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:31,351
Marcy... took that from him.

478
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:45,948
Then where is he?

479
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,118
Ugh. He's everywhere.

480
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,202
I don't understand.

481
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:55,333
001 transferred his consciousness
first into Ilsa,

482
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,668
and then out to the Internet.

483
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,129
By now, he's parsed himself into computers
and servers all over the world,

484
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,173
just waiting for the future to arrive,

485
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,842
and then he can take over.

486
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,346
I didn't think it would matter
if I said anything.

487
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,391
I just thought the Director
would stop him.

488
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,727
I just was waiting.

489
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,187
He won.

490
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:19,816
What?

491
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:22,694
Then why did we come here?

492
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:24,862
I'm sorry, Jo.

493
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,155
It's over.

494
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:34,998
Maybe not.

495
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,849
Maybe everything we need to fix this
is right here in front of us.

496
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,005
Maybe the Director
is just expecting us to see it.

497
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,066
How many timelines
are you seeing right now?

498
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,175
Just one. The only one left.

499
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:50,471
And it's gonna end
unless one of us goes back.

500
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:52,598
Back in time?

501
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,895
Whoa. Guys, even if one of us was able
to upload their consciousness into Ilsa,

502
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:58,998
and even if Ilsa had the electrical
and processing power...

503
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,148
Which it does.

504
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,524
The Director's made sure of that

505
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:04,235
by downloading the program into Ilsa
in the middle of the night.

506
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,322
Even then, we could only send someone
to a point in time

507
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,645
after the most recent Traveler.

508
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:12,160
No, from 431 years in the future,
that's true, absolutely,

509
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,370
but not from now.

510
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:20,877
The amplitude of space-time distortion
is directly proportional to distance.

511
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,589
How far back could one safely go
from this point in time?

512
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,672
Twenty years, easy.

513
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,217
All we need to do
is go back before 001 arrived.

514
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,018
That's why the Director's
been silent.

515
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,614
Because it knew we would think of this,

516
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,557
and it sent us what we would need
to do it.

517
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:40,146
I'm sorry, I do love this idea,
but we'd still need a TELL.

518
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,358
It's a time, elevation, latitude
and longitude

519
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,568
to send a consciousness
into a specific host.

520
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,112
You can't just guess. It has to be exact.

521
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:53,242
August 18th, 2001, Whytecliff Park,
exactly 3:00 p.m.

522
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,664
When and where my host met Kat.

523
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,540
Okay.

524
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,211
And I have one last objection,
but it's a big one.

525
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:07,674
If this works,
I'll be ending Grant MacLaren's life

526
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,926
17 years before his historical death,
I know.

527
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,550
But maybe I can give those years
back to someone else.

528
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,648
So...

529
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:27,652
until we meet again.

530
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,780
That's a very interesting possibility.

531
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:35,410
Well...

532
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:38,997
if we're gonna do this,

533
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:42,834
hurry the fuck up.

534
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,415
I'll find the coordinates to Whytecliff
and the IMEI of MacLaren's cell phone.

535
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,508
Trevor, help me load the program.

536
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,804
- See, Jo? There's still hope.
- Hope?

537
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,848
Mac,

538
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:00,018
you did this.

539
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,189
You people didn't stop
the collapse of civilization.

540
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,941
If anything, you sped it up.

541
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,406
Where are you going?

542
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,703
To look at the sky.

543
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:12,799
Beautiful view, isn't it?

544
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,092
- Oh, God.
- Sorry. Ha-ha.

545
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,551
Didn't mean to sneak up on you.

546
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:19,555
No, it's all right.
I was just expecting someone. He's late.

547
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:21,974
Some people are late people.

548
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,227
- Almost an hour?
- That's pretty late.

549
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,812
Hmm. On my birthday?

550
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,357
- Oh, he's in the doghouse.
- Yes, he is.

551
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,486
John's an artist.
He gets caught up in his work.

552
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,862
Is he any good?

553
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,368
He's brilliant, actually.

554
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,829
Maybe he's painting a portrait of you
for your birthday.

555
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,748
There are enough of those portraits
around the house, believe me.

556
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,375
Ah. Wow.

557
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:51,337
As intriguing as that is, we just met,
I should probably leave it alone.

558
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,300
- I love him, he just does this too often.
- So set him straight.

559
00:43:57,927 --> 00:44:00,304
Tell him if he respects you,
he won't keep you waiting,

560
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,699
and that he's goddamn lucky

561
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,560
to have a woman as beautiful
and charming as you in his life.

562
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,436
What?

563
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,482
I'm can't tell if you're flirting with me
or telling me to give him another chance.

564
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:17,113
Well, if I was him,
I know I'd want another chance.

565
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:23,327
But I'm not him.

566
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,957
Happy birthday.

567
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,784
Hey!

568
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,330
Who the fuck is this guy?

569
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,209
Sorry, I just wanna make sure
you're on the right bus.

570
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,212
This one's headed
to kind of a rough part of town.

571
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,922
I know.

572
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,529
I didn't like the way my patients
were being treated

573
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:31,015
at the old hospital I worked at,
so, I'm starting at a new one on Main.

574
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:34,518
Oh. I take some of my clients there.
I'm a social worker.

575
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:35,644
- Oh.
- Yeah.

576
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:37,271
- Are you doctor or a...?
- Uh, nurse.

577
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,397
- Nurse?
- Nurse, yeah.

578
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,856
Right.

579
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,195
Oh, it's a... it's a pretty busy hospital.

580
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,573
Just to warn you. A lot of tough cases.

581
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:52,620
- Well, I'm pretty tough.
- I bet.

582
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,562
I just wanna help the people
who really need it, you know?

583
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,546
Yeah. Yeah, same.

584
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:10,512
My name's David.
