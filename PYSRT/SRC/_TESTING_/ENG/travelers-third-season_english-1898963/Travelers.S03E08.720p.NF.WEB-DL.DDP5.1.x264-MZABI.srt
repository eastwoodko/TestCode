1
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,046
<i>Mom?</i>

2
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,007
<i>Mom?</i>

3
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,842
<i>I'm sorry about what happened.</i>

4
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:33,635
<i>I, uh...</i>

5
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,263
<i>I told the police it's not your fault.</i>

6
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,268
<i>You were right.
I shouldn't have been standing there.</i>

7
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:43,270
<i>Please don't be mad.</i>

8
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,021
<i>Mom...</i>

9
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,040
Oh!

10
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,799
Shit.

11
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,288
- Blanket.
- Call 911!

12
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,019
Yeah, there's been an accident.

13
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,324
The truck's on fire, but the guy got out.

14
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,006
Uh, we're in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,135
I think Pinewood Road, near the lodge.

16
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,021
- Are you all right?
- Thank you.

17
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,578
Oh. Oh, my God.

18
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,408
Why is there a news van
in my parking spot?

19
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,119
I need you to be an FBI agent today.
Can you do that?

20
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,203
You're not gonna fly off
on some mission somewhere?

21
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,916
- Sure.
- Good. I need to show you something.

22
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,799
If I get a ticket
for parking on the street...

23
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,044
Relax.

24
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,838
Ever heard of the Bellevue Butcher?

25
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,423
Serial killer.

26
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:02,469
Known for eating parts of his victims
before disposing of the bodies.

27
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,473
Five victims over 12 years,
though there may be more.

28
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,017
All mothers, all in abusive relationships.

29
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,477
Those poor women.

30
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,145
The mothers were the abusers.

31
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,316
Each of them have a history of domestic
violence against their children.

32
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,401
Now you've got a suspect.

33
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,737
Andrew Graham.

34
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,491
Yesterday, emergency crews
responded to a car fire.

35
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,993
He managed to make it out
with only minor burns,

36
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,328
but ended up vomiting.

37
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,622
When crews showed up, they found this.

38
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:35,502
- Please tell me that is not a human eye.
- In his stomach contents.

39
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,295
Oh, what a sick fuck.

40
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,019
We don't know who the eye belongs to yet.

41
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,025
I'm still waiting
on an updated missing person's report.

42
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,235
Did you run a DNA test on him?

43
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,136
His DNA doesn't match
any of the trace evidence we have on file.

44
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:48,390
- So all you've got is an eye.
- Basically.

45
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:52,394
Metro Police arrested him
on suspicion of desecrating a corpse,

46
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,955
but he's denying the whole thing.

47
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,522
Even denied himself a lawyer.

48
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,482
Oh. Well, at least he's stupid.

49
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,402
He claims he's innocent
and he has no recollection of the crimes,

50
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,381
which is why he's gonna be here
in a couple of hours for more questioning.

51
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,406
Okay.

52
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,449
Can you handle this?

53
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,662
- It's my Protocol 5. I have to.
- But can you?

54
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:17,919
Jo, I haven't shared a lot of details
about the future with you, but trust me,

55
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,673
this is nothing.

56
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,272
Philip.

57
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,648
Mm?

58
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:44,987
Carly?

59
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,117
What are you...? What, did we just...?

60
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,704
Ugh, copy that.
I'm just a few minutes out.

61
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,419
I'm really glad we grabbed that coffee.

62
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,192
I'm a machine!

63
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,282
Road trip!

64
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,674
Pick up some more tooth... paste
next time you're out.

65
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,195
- You're looking directly at me.
- Yeah.

66
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,073
I do that when I talk to you.

67
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,654
You're trying to navigate
through multiple timelines.

68
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:17,455
If you can't walk across the room
without crashing into your desk,

69
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,183
what's gonna happen in the field?

70
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,047
I'm working on it.
It just takes some practice.

71
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,812
The Director ordered you
to take pills for a reason.

72
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,004
I'm done taking drugs.

73
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,297
I need to get better on my own.

74
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,342
I have an idea.

75
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:39,519
- Okay, come on. Go for it.
- Marcy, those people are watching.

76
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,707
Well, are you gonna tell people to look
away the next time you get into a fight?

77
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,731
That's an option?

78
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,026
Just do what I showed you.

79
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,377
Okay, those people over there, they're...

80
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,742
they're just gonna think that I'm some
bearded man attacking a woman in a park.

81
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,493
Maybe we should tell them.

82
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,916
Saw that coming from a mile away.

83
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,377
- Did you hear a bone snap?
- No.

84
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,212
Come on, get up. Let's do it again.

85
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,965
You're just showing off at this point.

86
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,652
Pretend I'm one of those guys
that beat you up.

87
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,012
They didn't beat me up. It was one punch.

88
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,317
Okay, that didn't sound much better,
did it?

89
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,244
- How'd that make you feel?
- Oh, don't do that.

90
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,388
Huh? What are you gonna do about it?
Want me to get your balls out of my purse?

91
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,358
Oh, my God.

92
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,195
Marcy, I'm so sorry.
We're just... We're just training.

93
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,361
She's training me.

94
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,616
- I could've seriously hurt you.
- No, I'm fine.

95
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,451
- But you landed so hard.
- Yep.

96
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,997
Wait a second. I did it.

97
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:43,749
I flipped you.

98
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,044
You let me.

99
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,339
No. That... That was an honest flip.

100
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,966
Come on.

101
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,094
Let's head home.

102
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:55,977
I've got some other training
I wanna show you.

103
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,683
Crepes.

104
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,727
That's pretty fly.

105
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,397
No.

106
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:07,981
What?

107
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,610
Fly? Please tell me
that wasn't part of your training.

108
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,823
Fly, rad,

109
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,866
- groovy...
- Groovy?

110
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,284
...tubular.

111
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,964
That's wasn't funny.

112
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:31,713
Sorry.

113
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,259
Still on your solo mission?

114
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,139
- You know I'd tell you if I could.
- I understand. Go.

115
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,842
This was really nice, though.

116
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,036
Hello.

117
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,375
- I think there's been a misunderstanding.
- That's why we're here to figure out.

118
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,618
State your name for the recording.

119
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,629
Andrew Matthias Graham.

120
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,507
The special agents
conducting the interview

121
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,634
are Joanne Yates and Grant MacLaren.

122
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,220
- The time is 9:58 a.m.
- MacLaren?

123
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,805
Yes.

124
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,850
Can we start?

125
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,313
She look familiar?

126
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,443
No. Should I know her?

127
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,913
- Why would you show me that?
- Her name is Nancy Cooper.

128
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,832
She was found shot in her own home

129
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,460
while her husband was at the movies
with their son.

130
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:56,549
When they found her, they said her face
was unrecognizable from being cut apart.

131
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,678
- Do you remember that night, Andrew?
- What?

132
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:04,890
No.

133
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,896
- No, I'm a paramedic. I have a family.
- Here's the thing.

134
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,192
A lot of FBI agents spent a lot of time
building this case.

135
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:18,029
And not only do we know that all of these
women have something in common,

136
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:23,493
we also know that whoever killed them
has a taste for human flesh just like you.

137
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,578
So why don't you tell us the truth

138
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,373
before I make a personal recommendation
to the DA?

139
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,125
I am telling you the truth.
Agent MacLaren, you have to believe me.

140
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:35,421
Forensics found a human eye
in your stomach contents.

141
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:40,885
And that eye, as we just learned,
belonged to Linda MacVicar,

142
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:46,099
who was last seen yesterday morning
leaving her house to buy groceries.

143
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,434
Two nights ago,
there was a domestic disturbance

144
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,144
at the MacVicar foster home.

145
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,689
You were one
of the first responders on the scene.

146
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:56,693
You rushed her son to the hospital
with a broken arm.

147
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,446
Just like the other women,
you targeted an abusive mother

148
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,490
because she triggered memories
of your own mother.

149
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,700
Isn't that right, Andrew?

150
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:08,121
- Life is a gift. I would never do that.
- Except you did.

151
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,249
And you not only killed her,
you desecrated her body.

152
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,250
It wasn't me.

153
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,628
We have hospital service records tying you
to the other five cases.

154
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,964
We're gonna make sure
you never see sunlight again.

155
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:22,176
But right now, I just wanna know
where you left her body.

156
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,890
Can I have
a glass of water, please?

157
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,355
Fine.

158
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:45,450
I'm Traveler 7189. If I don't complete
my mission, a lot of people are gonna die.

159
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,035
- What?
- You're 3468.

160
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,369
I recognize you from training.

161
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,639
Why didn't you say something?

162
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,291
Not in front of her.
Now something has gone wrong.

163
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,793
I was trained to escape the burning car.

164
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,549
But we didn't know anything
about these murders.

165
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,574
The historical evidence
must've been destroyed in that fire.

166
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,635
Except this time, it survived.

167
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,012
In me.

168
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,726
You have to help me get out of here.

169
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,192
It is not even noon,
and I have a lecture in 30 minutes,

170
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,985
and there are gonna be people coming in...

171
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:25,114
And you need to learn how to celebrate
the little wins along the way.

172
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:30,078
- You think passing review is a little win?
- Uh, no. It's massive.

173
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,830
But don't let it get to your head.

174
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,499
Thank you.

175
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,838
Can you imagine?
I mean, we really have a shot...

176
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,590
No, no, no, don't say it.

177
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,801
Come on. It's the Nobel Prize.

178
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,552
You just jinxed it.

179
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:52,392
Amanda, if... if our work gets published,
it could change the world.

180
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,601
If.

181
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,561
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

182
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,037
Open your eyes.

183
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,207
What do you see?

184
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,667
I see you.

185
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,085
How many of me?

186
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,254
Just one.

187
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,217
How many fingers am I holding up?

188
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,471
Eleven.

189
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,098
There's three of you now.

190
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,059
You're not focusing.

191
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:37,228
Okay, four,
but only because you're in the middle.

192
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,525
Take a deep cleansing breath and focus.

193
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,351
Someone from the sheriff's office

194
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,562
just confirmed to<i> The Globe</i>
we caught the Bellevue Butcher.

195
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,855
You thought one news van was bad?

196
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,731
It's about to be a media circus
within the hour.

197
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,235
We've got a bigger problem than that.

198
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,218
Andrew Graham may have killed those women,
but that man did not.

199
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,304
- He's a traveler.
- No, no. No, no, no.

200
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,365
He arrived yesterday
with a very important mission,

201
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,034
and if we don't allow him to complete it,
a lot of people are gonna die.

202
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,703
Five minutes ago,
you were reading him the riot act,

203
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:18,978
and now you wanna set him free?

204
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,856
Only in order for him to finish
what he was sent here to do.

205
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,775
He recognizes his Protocol 5 has changed.
The future made a mistake.

206
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,796
Well, clearly, the Director has no problem
assigning a new traveler to a mission.

207
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,738
Find someone else.

208
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,865
The traveler in that room
is highly specialized.

209
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,201
He's the only one capable
of completing this mission.

210
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,202
Of course he is.

211
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,346
And we only have a few hours
before he loses that opportunity.

212
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,788
- What opportunity?
- I can't...

213
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,874
Bullshit. Tell me.

214
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,293
Stop a runaway train?

215
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,170
A plane from crashing? What?

216
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,463
You wouldn't understand.

217
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,717
- That is the most condescending...
- I wouldn't understand either.

218
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,095
- Jo, it's beyond our comprehension.
- But not beyond the rule of law.

219
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,263
The DA's on his way over

220
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,366
to charge Andrew with first-degree
murder against six women...

221
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,393
- A little time is all I'm asking.
- And I'm not giving it to you.

222
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,688
- We have a job to do, MacLaren.
- I'm doing mine.

223
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,567
Andrew Graham is gonna be charged
and sent to jail to await trial.

224
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:11,614
If you do anything to stop that,
I'll have you arrested.

225
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,697
Don't...

226
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,491
fuck with me.

227
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,384
And exhale.

228
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,970
I'm pretty sure
I've never used these muscles before.

229
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,613
Yoga's not only about physical strength
but mental strength, too.

230
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,558
It's a great stress relief.

231
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,060
I'm pretty good at handling stress.

232
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,730
I mean, it depends
on what kind of stress it is.

233
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,181
No, yeah, you're probably right.

234
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,532
- Uh, it can wait, it can wait.
- No, it's okay. I'm already up.

235
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,288
Jeff didn't make the meeting.

236
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,643
You know, he's been making such progress.
He's like a new man, but come on.

237
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,377
I'm sure he just forgot about it.

238
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,879
No. I put it in the day planner
that I bought him.

239
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,359
Who doesn't look at their day planner?

240
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,431
Maybe he has a good reason
to miss the meeting.

241
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,719
Mm, not cool.

242
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,064
I should probably check to make sure
he's not drinking somewhere again.

243
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,603
That's not your job, David.

244
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,981
It is.
It's actually the definition of my job.

245
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,744
But you can't be
everyone's guardian angel.

246
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,235
It's your day off. Jeff's a grown man.

247
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,112
I'm sure he just forgot about it.

248
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:34,904
Day planner.

249
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,908
You need to think about yourself
sometimes.

250
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,623
You know what else is great
at relieving stress?

251
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,916
- Ping-pong?
- Cold.

252
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,252
- Bocce.
- Colder.

253
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,088
- Hot oil massage.
- Warmer.

254
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,264
<i>Marcy, we've got a mission.
I'll be outside to get you in 90 seconds.</i>

255
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,018
Um, I'm sorry, I have to go.

256
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,537
- What did I say?
- Nothing, nothing.

257
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,355
I didn't realize what time it was.

258
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,732
But I promise I'll be back soon, okay?

259
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,277
I love you.

260
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:16,989
I love you, too.

261
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,679
They tell you what's inside this thing?

262
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,305
Nah. You?

263
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,055
Overheard that the case
was lined with lead, though.

264
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:51,273
Dawn wants to see you.
The rest of it can wait.

265
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:22,722
We do something wrong?

266
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,305
Oh, no.

267
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,765
Not at all.

268
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,185
I wanted to talk to you
because our movement

269
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,854
has been making a lot of progress.

270
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,066
And it hasn't gone unnoticed that the two
of you are dedicated to our cause.

271
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,860
It's actually inspiring.

272
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:38,904
All right.

273
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,450
That's why I personally wanted
to reward you with more responsibility.

274
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,910
Dawn, whatever it takes, I'm in.

275
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,411
Good.

276
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,460
Fuck you!

277
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
You're not finished.

278
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:17,985
What's the problem?

279
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,757
I've never killed anybody like this.

280
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,617
- You mean not in the line of duty?
- I mean, in cold blood.

281
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,036
This man's life was already taken
by a traveler,

282
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,663
one who was gonna compromise our mission.

283
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,811
Look, if this is some kind of test...

284
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,502
Of course it's a fucking test.
That's obvious.

285
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,297
Right.

286
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,718
Sure you can't use my help?

287
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,720
We got it covered.

288
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,726
They're on their way down.

289
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,604
Copy.

290
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,964
Step aside, please. Make room.

291
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,156
Andrew, is it true
you killed your mother?

292
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,120
- Agent Yates...
- Do you have anything to say?

293
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,805
We've got eyes on the traveler.

294
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,508
Here they come.

295
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,136
Copy.

296
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:23,110
<i>I have established a connection
to the van's operating system.</i>

297
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,198
- Why are we stopping?
- It just shut off.

298
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,125
<i>Doors are locked. Go.</i>

299
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,550
He's coming with us.

300
00:23:57,061 --> 00:24:00,856
MacLaren, you just crossed the line.

301
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,906
When the Director came back online,
we were forced into hiding.

302
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,825
Some of us who weren't overwritten,

303
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,162
we came here, living off the grid.

304
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,808
We suspected that there was a mole,

305
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,585
but we needed to be sure
before we entered the next phase.

306
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,382
You did the right thing, Jeff.

307
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,346
Sir, this is the one I told you about.

308
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:34,223
Officer Conniker.

309
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,017
Or are you not yet reinstated?

310
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:39,686
I will be.

311
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:43,649
Dawn feels you could be more useful
to the Faction, and I agree.

312
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,818
Thank you.

313
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,239
Wondering about our guest?

314
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,034
She's what the travelers call
an "Archivist."

315
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:58,122
They preserve important information
for the Director. It's all very secret.

316
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,339
So that's how the future sees
what's going on.

317
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,435
That's how the Director's knowledge
of the present has grown

318
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,002
since the Traveler program began.

319
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,257
Unfortunately, our typical methods
of questioning don't work

320
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,342
due to the nanites found
in her bloodstream.

321
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,053
But she'll break...

322
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,472
eventually.

323
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,438
We want you to stand guard
while we're gone.

324
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,082
I-I don't have to torture her or anything?

325
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,199
Well, if you like.

326
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,493
Happy hunting.

327
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,175
Hey, I'm Traveler 5416.

328
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,094
The Director sent me to find you.
We don't have much time.

329
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,512
They're after the archive.

330
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,223
I don't know what I told them.
They drugged me.

331
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,933
We have to secure it.

332
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,498
I can get you out of here,
but you've gotta show me where to go.

333
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:10,861
Your nanites are working overtime.
We've gotta get you to a medic.

334
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,393
<i>In an FBI-led manhunt
for Andrew Graham,</i>

335
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,878
<i>charged this morning
for the murders of six women,</i>

336
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,048
<i>has broken out of his police transport
30 minutes ago.</i>

337
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:35,135
<i>Authorities have confirmed that Graham
is on the loose and extremely dangerous.</i>

338
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,555
I swear I'm the least dangerous person
in this century.

339
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,303
We're almost there.

340
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:46,480
Could one of you tell me about prison
just so I know what to expect?

341
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,982
I didn't study a thing about it.

342
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,441
Uh, me neither.

343
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,524
Carly and Trevor are less than a minute
away from the university.

344
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,925
I've blocked all traffic cams
along their fastest route.

345
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,303
It's not everyday a serial killer
is broken out by vigilantes.

346
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:20,055
How did Yates take it?

347
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,818
She said,
"MacLaren, you crossed the line."

348
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,350
Well, she's not wrong.

349
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,370
<i>Philip, we're at the west entrance.</i>

350
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,645
Got it.

351
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,836
- Watch your backs.
- Yes, ma'am.

352
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,438
<i>Security cameras are offline.</i>

353
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,173
<i>You've got about 30 seconds
until IT suspects something.</i>

354
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,341
Let's go.

355
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,811
If you have questions
about your assignments, you can go...

356
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:09,521
Jesus Christ!

357
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,025
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

358
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,612
- I'm not him.
- Samantha, he's telling you the truth.

359
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,775
We're not here to hurt you.

360
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,661
- They've made contact.
- Great.

361
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,133
- Hands in the air!
- Don't move!

362
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:39,617
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!

363
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,848
Jo, how's your day?

364
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,058
Where the fuck is he?

365
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:52,648
Shit.

366
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,651
Stay down.

367
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:49,955
Let's go.

368
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:54,376
<i>Where is he?</i>

369
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,646
Currently completing
the mission he was sent here for.

370
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,046
- I told you...
- Andrew Graham

371
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,674
will be charged with first-degree murder
and sent to prison,

372
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,843
I assure you, right after he's done.

373
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,012
- The public is panicking.
- Who's fault is that?

374
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:08,056
If we didn't break him out,
there would be no public to protect.

375
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,682
What?

376
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:11,810
What is going to happen?

377
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,854
Lower your weapons, and we'll tell you.

378
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,691
Jo, I think you've got us covered.

379
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:26,759
Twenty years from now,

380
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,493
a highly-advanced
alternative energy source

381
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,370
causes an unforeseen gamma ray burst

382
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,081
that kills 1.4 billion people
within hours.

383
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,251
Imagine most of Europe being wiped out
in an afternoon.

384
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,129
Any survivors of the initial burst
eventually die off

385
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,839
when the ozone layer is stripped away.

386
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,133
There is no coming back from it.

387
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,177
What kind of energy source?

388
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:48,430
- It's called a singularity engine.
- What the hell is that?

389
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:51,558
Okay.

390
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,353
A nuclear power plant
is .08 percent efficient.

391
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,190
The sun's core is an order
of magnitude greater at .7 percent.

392
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,335
But utilizing the rotational movement

393
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,195
of a gravitational singularity,
theoretically,

394
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,323
provides a power source
that's 29 percent efficient.

395
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:08,658
Jesus Christ.

396
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:11,370
It's a civilization-ending event.

397
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,455
Okay.

398
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,247
Why today?

399
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:20,545
Travelers were sent to the 21st primarily
to stop an asteroid called Helios 685

400
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,381
from wiping out the eastern seaboard.

401
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,382
We did that.

402
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,777
Because of that, people survived
who would have otherwise died.

403
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:30,013
Including the two physicists,
Amanda Myers and Samantha Burns,

404
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,177
who patent the singularity engine
11 months from now.

405
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,977
Eleven months, MacLaren?

406
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,772
Today's the day their research
was accepted for publication.

407
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,898
We can't let that happen.

408
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,483
So you're assassinating them.

409
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,943
What? No.

410
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:47,114
Only a small number of people,
past or future, fully understand the math.

411
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,532
That's why it has to be Andrew.

412
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,492
Someone who can legitimately
explain to them

413
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,578
why their multi-billion dollar,
Nobel-Prize-winning breakthrough

414
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,539
is actually a really bad idea.

415
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,500
- Carly, how's it going there?
- <i>Should be done soon.</i>

416
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,587
I told you, the mission comes first.

417
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:08,343
Marcy, open up!

418
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,931
- Who is it?
- It's Jeff! Open the door.

419
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:20,105
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- Where's Marcy? I need a medic.

420
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,899
Jesus, that's a big gun.

421
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:25,920
- Okay, she's bleeding.
- Listen, I don't have time to explain.

422
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,737
- Where is she?
- Marcy's at work.

423
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,823
Shit. Hey, listen.
Get me a towel or something.

424
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:31,366
Yeah, towel. Right.

425
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,170
I need to put pressure
on this wound.

426
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,722
Hey, she's gotta have a medical kit
around here someplace.

427
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,746
Supplies, anything.

428
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,393
- How do you know so much about Marcy?
- We work together.

429
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:41,251
You're FBI?

430
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,295
David!
Do you know where her stuff is or not?

431
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,630
Yeah, yeah.
She's got a medical bag in the closet.

432
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,174
Found it.

433
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,736
There should be an auto-injector in there.
It's in a small case.

434
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,681
- Huh. I don't...
- Give me...

435
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,828
Thing is, she's never mentioned anything
about you two working together.

436
00:32:58,852 --> 00:32:59,852
I'll explain later.

437
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,692
- Where are we?
- What did you just give her?

438
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,815
The nanites in your blood were failing.
I came here to get a neurostimulator.

439
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,215
- Can you move?
- I think so.

440
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,365
Okay.

441
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,159
What's a neurostimulator?

442
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,871
No? Okay.

443
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:19,942
Hey, David, can you handle a gun?

444
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,209
- Sorry?
- A gun. Can you shoot?

445
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,836
Yeah. Yes. Marcy taught me. Why?

446
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,920
I need backup.

447
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,673
Me? Don't you think
we should be calling...?

448
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,175
David, this involves Marcy, too.

449
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,553
I need your help right now.

450
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,012
Okay.

451
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,264
Okay.

452
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,193
Hey, listen.

453
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,904
Don't shoot anybody unless I tell you to.

454
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,154
Oh, God, no.

455
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:54,282
Come on.

456
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,143
Which, again, leads back
to the singularity that's coalescing

457
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,919
and producing a gamma ray burst.

458
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,631
It's outside
this collapser model parameter.

459
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,446
I have to go now.

460
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,408
I am so sorry.

461
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,281
I still don't understand
how you knew about our work.

462
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,957
Unfortunately,
that information's classified.

463
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,836
The important thing now
is you stop this from ever moving forward.

464
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,337
Of course.

465
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,423
And Amanda?

466
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:58,305
Once I show her the proper math,
she'll understand.

467
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,899
It's time for my new Protocol 5, isn't it?

468
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,611
I have to place you under arrest now.

469
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,990
My mission is over.
Those... Those won't be necessary.

470
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,329
Yeah, the man just saved the world.

471
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,998
Why don't we do
one another little favor?

472
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,132
Not a single archive around the world
answered their secure line.

473
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,634
The world?

474
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:38,362
Which means there's a good chance
other archivists were kidnapped, too.

475
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,906
- I'm just the one that got away.
- You're afraid the others will talk.

476
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,098
I can't be sure I didn't.

477
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:45,226
We have to move the archive.
I'll call in reinforcements.

478
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,774
This is A-18. I have a protocol
Epsilon emergency at these coordinates.

479
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,973
- You need to tell me what's going on.
- Hey, in a minute.

480
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,375
Now, Jeff, or I'm calling the police.

481
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:11,002
As soon as she gives me my phone back.

482
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,440
What would you say if I told you
we're giving the future of civilization

483
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,464
a fighting chance?

484
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:18,259
They're on their way.

485
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,132
Get her inside the archive.

486
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,013
- What archive?
- Go.

487
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,390
- Now! Now!
- Let's go, David!

488
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,490
This place used to be
a roller rink when I was a kid.

489
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,340
Shouldn't I have clearance to see this?

490
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,931
Well, you are in no condition
to be giving blood right now.

491
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,683
Under the table, there are some cases.

492
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,978
Pack all the blood into them.
We have to be ready

493
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,498
to move them to the backup site
when the reinforcements arrive.

494
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,733
We're not moving any blood anywhere
until you get some medical attention.

495
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:15,942
It's not just blood.

496
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,486
It's genetically-stored,
historical information

497
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,530
encoded into DNA by nanites.

498
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:23,491
It's how the future receives
new information from the past.

499
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:28,829
Okay.

500
00:37:30,832 --> 00:37:32,832
What the fuck am I doing?

501
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:34,543
This is nuts.

502
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,305
The Faction may have compromised
the other archives.

503
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,391
If we don't preserve this one,
the Director will go blind.

504
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,895
Okay. I'm just gonna step outside,
I'm gonna make a quick call to 911,

505
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,439
and then... and then we'll do
your blood drive. Okay?

506
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,570
- Jesus.
- Those are my reinforcements.

507
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:02,548
What about Jeff? Do you think he's...?

508
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,412
David, load the blood into the cases.
We need to take as much as we can.

509
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:07,868
Okay.

510
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,336
I'm good. What do you call this again?

511
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,003
It's a hot dog.

512
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,923
Dog. Interesting.

513
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,966
- Not dog.
- Not dog.

514
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,342
I mean...

515
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,052
It's...

516
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,598
It's not actually made from...

517
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,351
Mm.

518
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,273
Did I say something wrong?

519
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,823
Not at all, Andrew. You're fine.

520
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,369
Just...

521
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,204
Let him finish.

522
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,541
Oh.

523
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,350
Hey. Sorry I'm so late.

524
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,981
David?

525
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,942
I think the shooting's stopped.
Maybe we can go outside and get a signal.

526
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,009
Good.

527
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:47,692
The reinforcements will know what to do.

528
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,563
This last bag
includes the most recent update.

529
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,315
<i>Hi, this is David Mailer.
Please leave a message.</i>

530
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:38,269
- I hate to admit it, but Trevor's right.
- Right about what?

531
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,439
Going for walks is good for the soul.

532
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,317
He's old and wise, our Trevor.

533
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,360
Yes, he is.

534
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,282
- Hey, do you wanna get a coffee?
- You making this weird again?

535
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,993
No, I-I just...

536
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,509
Philip.

537
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,510
Philip!

538
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,887
What?

539
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,807
There was a nuclear explosion in London.
