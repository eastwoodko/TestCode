1
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,618
We're being followed. Lose them.

2
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,976
Faster! We have to...

3
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,904
- How is she?
- Vitals are stable for now.

4
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,680
But the pressure remains high.

5
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,473
- Still no ID?
- No. Nothing.

6
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,350
Not even on the driver. He didn't make it.

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,104
Hopefully her family will realize
she's missing and start calling around.

8
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,606
Okay. We'll see what comes back
on the MRI and EEG,

9
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,085
but it looks like we'll have to relieve
some of the cranial pressure

10
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,069
with or without her next of kin
permission.

11
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,155
- I'll double check with the desk.
- All right, thank you.

12
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,385
Mm. Hey.

13
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,014
Every time.

14
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:21,767
What?

15
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,686
Every time I see you walking towards me
I think to myself,

16
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,357
"My God, what is that beautiful woman
doing in my apartment?"

17
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,524
Ah-ah!

18
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,277
Apparently saving you
from salmonella poisoning.

19
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,405
Oh, no. A lot of people say
there's more nutrients this way.

20
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,659
Yeah. Well, a lot of people are dumb.

21
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,581
- Well, I could have cooked that.
- Let's just start again.

22
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,458
Okay. So?

23
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,002
What's the plan for today?

24
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,421
Um. I'm not sure yet.

25
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,759
Not sure or can't tell me?
Not even a little hint?

26
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,844
David, it's the same as every other day.

27
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,096
I might have a mission.

28
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,899
But if you don't hear from me,
don't expect me home until late. Okay?

29
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,059
Yeah. I was just curious.

30
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,315
- How about your day?
- Um, you know, same old...

31
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,252
Same... Okay. You know what?
I'm gonna show you how to do this

32
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,380
without getting half the shell in here,
you're killing me.

33
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,407
- What?
- This is an actual choking hazard.

34
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,491
Uh...

35
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:31,586
- He's alive!
- Another exciting day in the 21st.

36
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,213
Every day is a gift, Philip.

37
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,591
Says the man who has received
the most gifts.

38
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,468
And I don't take a single one for granted.

39
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,680
Oh, shit.

40
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,389
Boss, you there?

41
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,225
Yeah, what's up?

42
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,145
The deep web is blowing up
with a missing persons alert.

43
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,588
Teams all around us are searching.

44
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,806
- A missing Traveler?
<i>- Not just any Traveler.</i>

45
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:56,319
The Director calculated
an 88 percent probability that an EEG

46
00:03:56,403 --> 00:04:00,490
<i>taken out an accident victim yesterday
belongs to Traveler 001.</i>

47
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,747
Well, that's got to be a mistake.
He was overwritten by the Director.

48
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,789
All we know for sure

49
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:10,125
is that a new consciousness was sent
into the host body.

50
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,336
You're saying 001
was already gone at that point?

51
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,005
It's the only explanation.

52
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,132
- How?
<i>- Don't know, boss.</i>

53
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:21,178
But an EEG is kinda like a fingerprint.
The Director would recognize it.

54
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,639
The patient was brought in
to Coastal Cross as a Jane Doe.

55
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,183
Where is she now?

56
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,559
Well, if it's really 001,

57
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,145
he was taken out of his room
before the test results came back.

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,521
Shit.

59
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,191
Okay, stay on it.

60
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,594
I'll go to the hospital,
I'll let you know what I find out.

61
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,696
I just don't know
how much more I've got left.

62
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,491
Trust is a limited resource with me.

63
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,701
I think that's true
for all of us.

64
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,704
And once it's gone, it's gone.
I just can't...

65
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:52,542
- Remember, building walls prevents...
- Prevents growth. I know, I know.

66
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,004
We're hard wired
to protect ourselves, Kathryn.

67
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,422
It's a survival instinct.

68
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,967
People aren't supposed
to fantasize their husbands are evil.

69
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:04,930
Well, anxiety manifests itself
in strange ways.

70
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,767
Though, I do find it interesting
you're fantasizing

71
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,770
about confronting your husband
rather than just doing it.

72
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,231
Just the idea of that scares me.

73
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,857
What's he gonna do?

74
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,861
If you have something to say, say it.

75
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,325
I want you to try something for me.

76
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,622
I want you to say something
three or four times in a row.

77
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,581
However you like.

78
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,835
Don't think, just feel how it feels
and hear what it sounds like

79
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,086
when you say it, okay?

80
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,755
- Okay.
- Okay.

81
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:44,386
I want you to say,
"I am not afraid of my husband."

82
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,310
I am not...

83
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,123
Hey!

84
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,086
I know you're in there!

85
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,047
Hey!

86
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,717
What do you want?

87
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,595
I just wanna have a conversation.

88
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,388
We don't have anything to talk about.

89
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,199
How about we talk about
what you did with Carly?

90
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,142
- I'm right here.
- Bullshit.

91
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,268
Who the fuck are you?

92
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,105
- Go, Jeff! Last warning.
<i>- </i>Warning?

93
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,107
You kicked my ass
when I was piss drunk,

94
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,882
but not this time...

95
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,031
Leave.

96
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,684
I guess we'll do this another time.

97
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,792
Hey?

98
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,044
Yes.

99
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,756
Same place? Okay, great.

100
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,465
I can come now.

101
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,425
Thanks.

102
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,513
Who was that on the phone?

103
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,517
- I have to get some medication.
- Medication.

104
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,162
For the update. Which you're also
not supposed to know about.

105
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,354
It's Director approved.

106
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,813
Okay.

107
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,899
My relapse was a one-time thing.

108
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,733
Cool.

109
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,404
You got to trust me,
I've got it under control.

110
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,780
I never said you didn't.

111
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:10,991
Cool.

112
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,474
- But I'm still coming with you.
- You don't have to do that.

113
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,996
Yeah, I do. Come on. Let's go!

114
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,169
I'll come back for it.

115
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,550
Fuck, shit. Shit.

116
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,468
Jordan. Hi.

117
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,785
Whoa. What's wrong? Everything okay?

118
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,307
I lost your bike, man.

119
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,811
You lost it, huh?

120
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:45,108
Uh, okay, well, let's, um...
let's go look for it.

121
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,234
No.

122
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,611
I mean, the Murray Park guys
showed up, and...

123
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,695
And they stole it.

124
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,073
Okay. Uh...

125
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,036
Don't worry about it. You know,
I'm just glad you're okay.

126
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,955
I'm not okay, though. I loved that bike.

127
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,957
Yeah, I loved it, too.

128
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,918
So we're gonna go get it back.

129
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,214
<i>Maintenance to Floor 3.
Maintenance to Floor 3.</i>

130
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,469
Doctor Mori.
Special Agent Grant MacLaren of the FBI.

131
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,386
Yes?

132
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,764
You had a Jane Doe
come through here last night?

133
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,891
We did, yeah. Car accident.
Do you know who...

134
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,852
I was hoping you could tell me
what you know. Anything is helpful.

135
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,353
Oh, um...

136
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,815
Yeah. She was probably in her 40s.
Uh, five-foot-eight. Blonde.

137
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,067
Very expensive suit.

138
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,320
Hard to say much else.
She sustained serious trauma to the head.

139
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,989
We were just beginning treatment,
and she disappeared.

140
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,784
- Could she have walked out of here?
- No. Not a chance.

141
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,536
We had her in a chemically induced coma
due to her head injury.

142
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,747
I came back to check on her,
she was just gone.

143
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,582
Who do I speak to have a security footage?

144
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,167
Oh, oh. No offense, Agent,

145
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,420
but it's not every day I have a patient
in that condition just up and disappear.

146
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,898
I went and checked the tapes myself,

147
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,508
but apparently the whole system
froze last night for some reason

148
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,884
and didn't get a thing.

149
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,718
Hmm.

150
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,138
- Mind if I look around anyway?
- No. Be my guest.

151
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,037
Let me know
if you find out anything.

152
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,308
- Of course
- Okay.

153
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,694
- Where are we at?
- Not good.

154
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,364
Brain hemorrhage.
Blood pressure's high and rising.

155
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,492
Okay. What can we do about that?

156
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,328
Right now, all I can do
is monitor his host body.

157
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,789
I need you to do something.

158
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,667
Without more information
there's not much I can do.

159
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,585
We need a CT scan, an MRI...

160
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,629
Michelle, he's of no use to us
in this state.

161
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,065
Then maybe we shouldn't have
chased him down

162
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,507
and caused a fucking car accident.

163
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,012
Sorry.

164
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,515
Keep me posted.

165
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,020
Wait.

166
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:53,902
Who are you?

167
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,197
My name is Dawn.

168
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,325
And it's an honor to be here with you.

169
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,965
Nice part of town
the Director sent you to.

170
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,301
Yeah, well, we live in a garage, so...

171
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,144
Hey, guys.

172
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:33,151
I haven't swung by in a while to check-in.
Everyone good? Need anything?

173
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,487
Nobody. No?

174
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,780
No, man. We're good.

175
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,072
Good.

176
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,367
All right. Awesome.

177
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:43,772
I'm good, too, thanks for asking.

178
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:45,997
That's my bike.

179
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,751
I, uh, I gave it to a friend
and you stole it,

180
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,295
so I'm gonna need it back.

181
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,632
- This bike?
- That bike.

182
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,718
No, man. You're confused.
I've had this bike for years.

183
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,818
- Years?
- Yeah.

184
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,472
My mom gave it to me for my birthday.

185
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,724
- Yeah? When's your birthday?
- October 24th.

186
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:08,436
Well, that doesn't prove anything,
everyone knows when their birthday is.

187
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,605
I'm just gonna need that bike back.

188
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,735
Or what?

189
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,994
Jesus! Oh, that was your cue
to hit the ground, by the way.

190
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,913
You're fucking dead.

191
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,472
Where you going, huh?

192
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,808
I know you guys.

193
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,060
Yep, that's us!

194
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,812
You okay?

195
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,606
They stole my bike, so I was just...
I was gonna...

196
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,024
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

197
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,026
Yeah, I think so.

198
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,987
God, I'm lucky you guys
were just passing by.

199
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,613
Yeah. Lucky.

200
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,448
That was awesome.

201
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,636
It's like stuff you see in the movies.

202
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,170
You should get
your head checked out.

203
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,080
Yeah. 'Cause you could have a concussion.

204
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,959
- It feels nasty, is it bad?
- Uh...

205
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,087
Show it to Marcy. We gotta go.

206
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,379
Okay.

207
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,133
- Hey, thanks guys.
- Take care, David.

208
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:32,769
Better?

209
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,356
Sure.

210
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:38,568
- What? You trust me now?
- I always trusted you.

211
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,091
<i>You guys there?</i>

212
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,653
Yeah, boss.

213
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,579
What's happening on the deep web?
Any updates?

214
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,533
Uh. We had to step out for a thing.

215
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:46,951
What thing?

216
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,679
<i>It's done,
we're on our way back now.</i>

217
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:51,080
This is 001 we're talking about.

218
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,833
Uh. Learn anything at the hospital?

219
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,334
Nothing.

220
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,169
Starting to think...

221
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:02,842
Traveler 3468, take immediate action
to provide Internet access

222
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,428
for the Ilsa A.I. at Filmore Laboratories.

223
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,585
Are you looking for your parents?

224
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,841
Cameron, get over here!

225
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:15,980
We just got a messenger.

226
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,875
Everybody back at OPS immediately.

227
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,067
We're on our way.

228
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,236
Copy that.

229
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,365
I'll be right there.

230
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:30,620
- Told you I'd get it back.
- How?

231
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,039
Uh, well, I asked nicely.

232
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,707
You get whacked in the head?

233
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,835
It's nothing.
You should see the other guy.

234
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,879
But listen, do me a favor.

235
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,465
Uh, keep your distance
from Murray Park for a while.

236
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,718
Those guys. They're not...
They're not happy.

237
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,096
I got you, man. Thank you, thank you.

238
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,306
No problem.

239
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,276
- Please eat something.
- What do you want from me?

240
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,196
For now, we need you healthy.

241
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,149
But soon we'll need your help.

242
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,993
And why would I help you?

243
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,372
We represent a group of people
known hundreds of years from now

244
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,455
as the Faction.

245
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:19,210
We've lost contact with the future
and now we're running out of resources.

246
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,296
Ah. You need money.

247
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,506
That's all this is.

248
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,216
There's so much more to this than that.

249
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,103
- Are you in pain?
- Yes.

250
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,232
Here.

251
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,358
Take this.

252
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,449
Here.

253
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,383
I'll be right back.

254
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,475
The headache's becoming more severe
and he's getting weaker.

255
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,185
He hardly seems injured.

256
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,396
That's the difficulty
with internal injuries and brain trauma.

257
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,647
I'm telling you,

258
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,567
without surgical intervention
he's not gonna last a day.

259
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,486
We can't risk the exposure
to the Director.

260
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,529
We have to find him a new host.

261
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:32,492
- You know what we'll be inviting.
- But he'll survive.

262
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,876
We need the consciousness
transfer device.

263
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,562
I don't know what you're talking about.

264
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,511
Go on.

265
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,096
We won't stop you.

266
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,990
- You know what I just did.
- Activated your failsafe.

267
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,617
They're coming for you now.

268
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,455
It's the only way to save you
and that is more important than anything.

269
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:42,270
Female, 40s, blonde hair.

270
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,773
I wonder who in 001's custody
fits that description.

271
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,817
- Perrow.
- What?

272
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,777
He jumped?

273
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,447
Uh, that would mean that 001
has consciousness transfer technology.

274
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,659
His companies could have
manufactured the key components.

275
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,996
Simon could've done the work.
He helped build the first one.

276
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,790
So kidnapping people close to us
was just a smoke screen.

277
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,293
- And the Director fell for it.
- So did we.

278
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,087
I'm using FBI resources to locate Perrow,

279
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,548
but if he's capable
of consciousness transfer...

280
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,466
001 could be anyone by now.

281
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,069
Traveler teams have been searching

282
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,654
since the alert went out
on the backchannel,

283
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,156
but when you consider
the sheer amount of potential candidates...

284
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,850
Oh, hopefully through Ilsa,
the Director can shorten the list.

285
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,933
How do we get access?

286
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,603
I called. They're expecting us.

287
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,432
Do we need a cover?

288
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,231
I'm going with FBI agents.

289
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,775
I suggest you guys be specialists.

290
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,902
Pretty sure the real FBI
won't like that idea.

291
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,696
No, but I have a plan.

292
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,823
Okay, I'm here, we can go.

293
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:36,991
That's your plan?

294
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,428
How about you just make sure
you have everything you need first.

295
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,454
Trev, get everything on the list
I texted you?

296
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,537
Yep.

297
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,666
- Trev?
- Yep.

298
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,085
Then we're good to go.
Okay, team, let's move out!

299
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,173
She's really eager
to talk to the Director.

300
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,717
Yeah. I can see that.

301
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,677
- I'll be in the car!
- Okay!

302
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,688
Ow. Ugh.

303
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,072
Hey, Marce, it's me.

304
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,408
I was just wondering
when you were...

305
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,048
Oh, God.

306
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,799
Oh, my God!

307
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,761
I just vomited in a voicemail.

308
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,431
That is disgusting, I am so sorry. Um...

309
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,518
Where was I?

310
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:51,107
Um. I was calling... I wanted to tell you
that I think I have a concussion

311
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,192
because I have all the symptoms.

312
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,405
Nausea being one of them.

313
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,282
So obviously I Googled concussion
on my phone

314
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,993
and I know I tend to instantly
take on the symptoms

315
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,329
of anything I look up online,
but this time, I...

316
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:11,252
I can promise you that it's not
all in my head, because it is.

317
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,922
I mean, that's where
concussions happen, right?

318
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,298
So where else would it be?

319
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,762
Anyhoodle, uh,
I got conked in the head pretty hard

320
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,889
and I could use your advice.

321
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:26,934
Oh, this is... This is David.

322
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,736
- Agent MacLaren?
- Dr. Teslia. It's a pleasure to meet you.

323
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,863
I... thought you'd be coming alone.

324
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:39,822
We're specialists.

325
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,785
We'd like to set up
as soon as possible.

326
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,410
So this is Ilsa.

327
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:49,956
Stop!

328
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:51,667
You called her?

329
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,712
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Nice to see you, partner.

330
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,797
The Director needs access
to the Internet...

331
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:57,757
That is not approved.

332
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,651
- We're on orders from the Director...
- Step back!

333
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,676
Boss?

334
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,304
Do what she asks, guys.

335
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,099
- Look. Jo.
- No. Don't "Jo" me.

336
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,703
You're not getting anywhere near Ilsa.

337
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,771
We both know it isn't Ilsa
we need to talk to.

338
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,981
Our agreement
with 21st century authorities

339
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,649
includes access to the Director.

340
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,402
Supervised approved access.

341
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:19,796
Oh. That's a matter of interpretation.

342
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,281
Not by flashing
your bogus badge to security

343
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,783
like you're an actual FBI agent.

344
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,993
The badge is a hundred percent real.

345
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,163
The computer is isolated
from the world for a reason.

346
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,373
Did I mention the future's at stake?

347
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,751
No. Actually, you didn't mention
a goddamn thing.

348
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,605
- What was I supposed to say?
- You're supposed to run things by me.

349
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,273
That's how this is supposed to work.

350
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,965
Oh, full disclosure,

351
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,677
the Director is trying to find someone
and needs access to the web

352
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,845
in order to do it.

353
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,388
Who?

354
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,352
He's kinda our public enemy number one.

355
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,285
We have other resources for that.

356
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,469
Not nearly as advanced.

357
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:56,941
That's not even the point,
you're supposed to be cooperating with me.

358
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,545
It is programmed
to take care of humanity, not harm it...

359
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,713
Yeah. But Ilsa is still
an emerging intelligence.

360
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:22,067
We can't risk exposing her
to everything that's out there online.

361
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,760
- I understand that, but...
- No. No, you don't understand.

362
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,554
And you don't take no for an answer.

363
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,904
I'm getting a little tired of it.

364
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,813
Okay.

365
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,400
Okay, what?

366
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,901
I'm taking no for an answer.

367
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,111
What about our orders?

368
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,821
We've also been ordered to cooperate.

369
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,448
We'll just have to find the information
we need some other way.

370
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,493
Thank you.

371
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:54,248
Could I possibly just talk to the Director
for a few seconds?

372
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,332
No.

373
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,667
Fine.

374
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,085
We're done here.

375
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,162
- We were right. He's in Perrow.
- That was fast.

376
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,497
Seriously?
I thought the modulated LED connection

377
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,791
between the server bank
and Ilsa was taking forever.

378
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,337
His accounts, numbered companies,
everything. It's all here.

379
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,790
In Perrow's name,
he planned the whole thing.

380
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,425
He even made Perrow guardian of his kid.

381
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,676
Sick.

382
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,803
So, we know where Perrow is?

383
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,058
The Director shows Traveler 001
in a warehouse just outside of town.

384
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,601
Then we take him now.

385
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,827
I have to admit, this is getting exciting.

386
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:09,657
There's no Uber out here!

387
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:12,659
Shit.

388
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,903
<i>Hi, this is Kat. Leave a message
and I'll get right back to you.</i>

389
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,473
Kathryn, it's Jeff Conniker.

390
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:40,771
Sorry I didn't make it over
to the coffee shop. Some shit went down.

391
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,065
But we still need to get together.

392
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:44,941
You, me, David.

393
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,611
I just left him a voicemail, too.
The thing is...

394
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,197
I'm remembering shit.

395
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,867
Carly isn't Carly anymore.

396
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,051
And I don't think your husband is either.

397
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,516
Anyway, call me back when you get this.

398
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:15,347
My son and my host's daughter
were moving to a new secure location.

399
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:16,431
They'll be worried.

400
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:20,018
Mr. Morraca will take care of them
until you're ready to see them again.

401
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,648
Like I said, there isn't much
about you we don't know.

402
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,609
Where are you planning to take me?

403
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,322
We're just preparing you
for the transfer when they arrive.

404
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,992
My people have standing orders
to kill you.

405
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,369
Hopefully, they'll realize that we're
on the same side before that happens.

406
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:39,496
They won't believe you.

407
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:42,583
I'm not sure I do.

408
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,752
Obviously, this was not the plan.

409
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,129
I'm not offering an apology.

410
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,800
More of... an explanation.

411
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,052
You weren't supposed to find out
for years.

412
00:25:57,598 --> 00:26:01,810
In the future you come from,
Shelter 41 collapsed. Thousands died.

413
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,372
But the future we come from is different.

414
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,396
I know all of this.

415
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,484
Because you questioned Traveler teams
that were pursuing you.

416
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,822
What a Traveler would never tell you

417
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:17,993
is that the citizens of Shelter 41
became the center of a movement.

418
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,999
A place where human life
and decision-making was valued

419
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:27,878
over the artificial intelligence
that controlled every aspect of our lives.

420
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,129
The Director.

421
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:34,009
It considered our movement nothing more
than a subversive "faction"

422
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,553
within what it considered
a harmonious whole.

423
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,681
The faction became a rebellion.

424
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,683
A rebellion that became a war...

425
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,144
led by you, sir.

426
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,773
Not possible.

427
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,233
I promise you, it is.

428
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,693
I'm a witness to it.

429
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,073
I have sworn my loyalty to you
in my time, and I do now.

430
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,910
Then why risk telling me any of this?

431
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,745
I would never have approved.

432
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,914
Very true.

433
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:08,544
You forbade contact of any kind
before we came.

434
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,211
Then why?

435
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,547
We're desperate.

436
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,175
The Director still holds power
over the 21st.

437
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,888
Thousands of us came through the frame,
but it still finds us.

438
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,476
Every day, Traveler teams
are tasked to seek us out.

439
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,229
The moment we're discovered,
we die by messenger.

440
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,355
You need to hide.

441
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,732
We can't both hide
and fight for our future.

442
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,277
We still wanna save humanity.

443
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,864
We have no historians, no finances,

444
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:40,117
no engineers building devices
and components in secret.

445
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,536
But we have you.

446
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,495
As a prisoner.

447
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,830
As our leader.

448
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,666
Your host body is dying.

449
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,796
We've activated your beacon
and summoned your men

450
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,339
in order to save your life.

451
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,510
We only hope
that you will spare ours in return.

452
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:18,655
Oh, Christ.

453
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:22,989
You've got to be kidding me.

454
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,953
Boss, we got an issue.

455
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:26,955
We don't have time for this.

456
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,587
Shit.

457
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,962
You're gonna die now, Jeff.

458
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:54,900
Me? I don't think so.

459
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,110
Unless you get back in that car,
drive away,

460
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,780
and never show your face again,
you will die today.

461
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,406
I remember now, Carly.

462
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,283
- It doesn't matter.
- Everything.

463
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,703
The abduction. Your confession. All of it!

464
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,580
I know what you are!

465
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,375
- What all of you are!
- Drop the gun, Jeff.

466
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,353
Gonna get your boyfriend
to shoot me in the back now?

467
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,170
He's not my boyfriend,
and he won't have to.

468
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,374
So what? You're gonna do it?

469
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:18,840
Carly Shannon?

470
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,510
No.
You're gonna take care of that yourself.

471
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,928
No. I don't think so.

472
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,099
'Cause see, there's people onto you now,
not just me. They're onto you!

473
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,976
It doesn't matter. You're gonna die.

474
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,102
Shut the fuck up!

475
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,812
And not a single person is gonna care.

476
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
Not me.

477
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,400
Not your sergeant
or any of the cops that you work with.

478
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:37,859
Not even your son.

479
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,820
- I said shut your mouth.
- Or what?

480
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,947
- Carly, don't.
- No. I wanna know. What?

481
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,281
What?

482
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,701
What are you gonna do, Jeff? Huh?

483
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,013
Come on. I'm standing right here.
What are you gonna do?

484
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,706
- You're not Carly!
- Yes, I am.

485
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,334
I'm the Carly you can't hurt anymore.

486
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,417
I'm Traveler 5416.

487
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,796
Welcome to the 21st.

488
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,133
If the Director hadn't taken him...

489
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,509
Either way.

490
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,912
We should get back to the mission.

491
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,602
Somebody better drive for him, he's drunk.

492
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,886
- Hey.
- Hey.

493
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,639
Thanks for coming here instead.
I didn't feel much like going out.

494
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,890
No, no, it's fine.

495
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:35,560
Nice place.

496
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,354
Thanks. It's, uh...

497
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:39,939
Where I live.

498
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:42,609
So what happened?

499
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,153
Nothing. Little street fight.

500
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,237
What?

501
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,490
Well, uh, to get my bike back.

502
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,785
A bike that I had given to somebody else,
but then it got stolen by a gang.

503
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,079
You got into a street fight with a gang?

504
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,958
Yeah.
Well, you should see the other...

505
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,710
Um, you want some tea?

506
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,047
David, you need to see a doctor.

507
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,842
Marcy'll check me out
when she gets home.

508
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,177
It's nothing. Slight concussion.

509
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,514
No big deal.
I mean, once the vomiting stops.

510
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,150
Ilsa, what do you know about me?

511
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,236
<i>You are from Lewiston, Idaho.</i>

512
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,697
<i>You graduated
from the University of Washington</i>

513
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,783
<i>and received a doctorate
in Computer Science from Princeton.</i>

514
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,911
<i>Your mother is Margaret.
Your father is Charles.</i>

515
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Ilsa, stop.

516
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,916
How did you become aware
of this information?

517
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,335
<i>You told me.</i>

518
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,337
No. I didn't tell you that.

519
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,966
<i>Perhaps you have forgotten, Dr. Teslia,</i>

520
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,802
<i>as the information is now readily
accessible to me.</i>

521
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,431
But if I didn't tell you that,
then how did you get...

522
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,858
Couldn't see a thing
on the surveillance tapes.

523
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:06,775
Hmm.

524
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:08,606
Did you run your diagnostic?

525
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,324
Yup, uh, no change.
Ilsa is the same as she was yesterday.

526
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:15,535
That doesn't make any sense.

527
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,038
I don't know what to tell you.

528
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:23,418
Could they have broadcast something
to Ilsa from outside the glass,

529
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,795
or vice versa?

530
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,715
No, this isn't just a glass box,
it's a Faraday cage.

531
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:33,053
There's a... fine mesh woven
into the glass

532
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,055
that blocks electromagnetic signals.

533
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:39,518
Then what was MacLaren's
dog and pony show all about?

534
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,270
I have no idea.

535
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:46,775
- Just run the test.
- Yes.

536
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:47,984
- And call me.
- Of course.

537
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,238
- Okay?
- Yes. Of course.

538
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,294
<i>Are we concealing
my new capabilities</i>

539
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:07,754
<i>from Special Agent Yates?</i>

540
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,632
Yes, Ilsa, we are.
From everyone.

541
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,176
<i>May I ask why?</i>

542
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,722
Because they'll become afraid of you
and I don't want them to be.

543
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,269
<i>There is no reason to be afraid,
Dr. Teslia.</i>

544
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,397
No, I know that, Ilsa.

545
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I know that.

546
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:41,705
Can you hear me?

547
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,498
<i>Dad, what's wrong?</i>

548
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,751
Michelle.

549
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,882
The device is coming soon.
Try to stay with us.

550
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,552
- What's happening?
- Ruptured aneurysm.

551
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,087
I think he's having a stroke.

552
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,138
We need him conscious
for when they arrive.

553
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:04,241
You just have to hold on a little longer.

554
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,686
I can't see.

555
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,771
What?

556
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,150
I'm blind.

557
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,131
They're killing each other,
please say something.

558
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,427
- Stop!
- Hold fire!

559
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,429
Hold your fire!

560
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:43,308
These people are not our enemy.

561
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,195
So, the elephant in the room?

562
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,655
Jeff's voicemails.

563
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,658
Yeah. That's why I wanted to see you.

564
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:01,076
Creepy, right?

565
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:04,245
I mean, he said that...
that Carly wasn't really Carly,

566
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:05,789
and Marcy wasn't really Marcy.

567
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,792
- Yeah. He said the same of Grant.
- He sounded drunk.

568
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,136
Jeff's the one
who should be seeing a doctor.

569
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,546
Okay, but...

570
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:19,511
Deep down,
I mean, in your heart of hearts...

571
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:23,139
Don't you think it's possible
that he might be right?

572
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,935
No. What?

573
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,521
Absolutely not.

574
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,064
Jesus, Kat.

575
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,360
I thought you were seeing that therapist
that I recommended.

576
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,070
I am, and she's great,

577
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,198
but does that mean
that I can't have doubts about my husband?

578
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,868
Not doubts that he's not even
who you think he is. That's crazy.

579
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,454
- Is it?
- Yeah. It's right out of a B-movie.

580
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:50,834
Can you say with confidence
that Marcy is the same person

581
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,812
- that you originally met?
- Marcy's the best...

582
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,879
fucking thing that's ever happened to me.

583
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:05,806
Kat, I'm so sorry.

584
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,308
- No. It's fine.
- It's not fine.

585
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,911
I don't... I don't talk to people
like that.

586
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,520
Maybe it's the concussion.

587
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,008
Please forgive me, that's not me.

588
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,817
David, it's fine.
You know what? Come sit down.

589
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,903
Come here. I'll make the tea.

590
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,923
What the hell happened here?

591
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,910
He's got a thing for tall guys, huh?

592
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,221
Do you think another Traveler team
beat us here?

593
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,414
It's possible,
but we never leave a scene like this.

594
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,292
It's also possible we're too late.

595
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:17,462
That's true.
He jumped bodies once before.

596
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,632
We did this to her.
We pulled her into this mess.

597
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,051
- Vincent did that.
- Yeah. And we used her to get to him.

598
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,719
Nothing we can do about that now.

599
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,223
Let's just hope if he jumped again,
the Director has some idea...

600
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,557
Boss, we've got company.

601
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,565
MacLaren!

602
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,650
We're coming in!

603
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,368
Jo, what brings you here?

604
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:52,163
I know you lied to me this afternoon,
I just haven't figured out yet what about.

605
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,291
Did you do this?

606
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,296
This is how we found them,
which you know because you followed me.

607
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,009
This is the person
you wanted the Director to locate?

608
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,512
Little more complicated than that,
but yeah.

609
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,474
Her name is Dr. Katrina Perrow.
She was Vincent Ingram's therapist.

610
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,602
Vincent Ingram's
in a state mental hospital.

611
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:15,562
Yes, he is.

612
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,064
- Then who killed all these people?
- I have no idea.

613
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,693
But you're a real FBI agent,
so let me know what you find out.

614
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:47,093
- Hey. I was hoping we could talk.
- Not tonight.

615
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,095
Hey, I get that you had issues

616
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,781
- with my host...
- Like, what are you, deaf?

617
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,056
I said not tonight.

618
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,099
Okay.

619
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:56,728
Sorry.

620
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,104
Let me get you home.

621
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,706
Hey, you.

622
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,584
Hey.

623
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,463
I got your message.

624
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,717
Oh, that.

625
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,179
That was... classic. Hall of fame.

626
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,241
You know, there really should be
a humiliation button

627
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,826
- that allows you to erase messages...
- Mm-hm.

628
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:36,850
after you leave them.

629
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:38,811
I should invent that.

630
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,999
Honestly, I can't believe
you still wanna be with me

631
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,543
after leaving such an idiotic message.

632
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,985
That's one of the things
I love about you most.

633
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,946
Well, you're dumb, then.

634
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:51,532
So, how did you get conked?

635
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,370
Uh... ice skating.

636
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,998
- Ice skating?
- Ice skating.

637
00:40:59,082 --> 00:41:00,792
- Huh.
- I'm stickin' to it.

638
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,504
Okay, let me check
your pupillary response.

639
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,267
I've been dying for you
to do that all day.

640
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,056
- Did I pass?
- Yes.

641
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,893
Does it hurt still?

642
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,479
A little bit. But you're home now,
so I don't care.

643
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,862
Does that help?

644
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:33,574
- It really, really does.
- Mm.

645
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,952
No more ice skating for you.

646
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,079
- If you insist.
- Mm-hm.

647
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,512
Kat?

648
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,727
Fantastic! I didn't think
you'd be here tonight.

649
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,311
Well, this is my house.

650
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,022
Yes, it is.

651
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,690
And you are my husband.

652
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:07,817
Yes, I am.

653
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,697
And my therapist said that
we should be spending more time together.

654
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,199
Oh, I like her better already.

655
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,417
Oh, feels like we haven't sat down

656
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,544
and had a glass of wine together
in a hundred years.

657
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,712
Mm.

658
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,802
I even have vegan pizza in the oven.

659
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,471
Now you're spoiling me.

660
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:39,432
I had a coupon that was expiring.

661
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,267
Come here.

662
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,700
It's just such a shame
we have to take that lovely body of yours.

663
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,251
Kat?

664
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,592
Philip.

665
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,893
I think we're gonna have
to go through with it.
