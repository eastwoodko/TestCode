1
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,588
I am so sorry.

2
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,962
RANDY: How could he be offering
a Whistler chalet

3
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,928
a Tuscan villa,
and a Caribbean hideaway

4
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,880
all for 20,000 dollars?

5
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,429
I've gotta be honest...
I'm wondering the same thing.

6
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,893
Look, I've been
doing this a while

7
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,312
and I have
never seen a deal like this!

8
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,290
So which property
appeals to you the most?

9
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,400
Maybe the Caribbean hideaway?

10
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,523
Don't we all
wish we were there right now?

11
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,318
But seven to ten days a year?

12
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,275
That's, like,
2,000 dollars a day.

13
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,030
RANDY:
Yeah! If you go once!

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,411
It's a lifestyle.

15
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,115
Isn't that what you said
you were interested in, Dale?

16
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,284
Yeah... I said that.

17
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,983
But that was after you said
this would only take ninety minutes

18
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,873
and we'd get a free dinner
at House of Rib.

19
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,711
Ninety minutes...

20
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,713
No, I hear you.

21
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,802
RANDY:
Alright...

22
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
I don't know how I'm gonna do it

23
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:44,859
but let me go talk to my manager

24
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:46,353
and see if we can do better.

25
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,017
Give me five.

26
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,860
When I come back,
you'll have a whole new perspective.

27
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,868
LOCK BEEPS

28
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,504
PEOPLE SCREAMING

29
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,650
DOOR OPENS

30
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,950
DOOR SHUTS

31
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,914
FOOTSTEPS

SHE GASPS
- HE SIGHS: Kat!

33
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,987
I thought you said
the danger was over.

34
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,135
It is.

35
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,585
Then why are you holding a gun?

36
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,133
You didn't call me back.

37
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,451
I thought you were still
at your mother's.

38
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:05,119
Why didn't you say something
when you came in the house?

39
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,554
I expected you to be at work!

40
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,261
HE SIGHS
I've been up all night. I'm sorry if-

41
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,304
Doesn't matter, I'm just glad you're home.
- I'm not home.

42
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:14,194
I'm just here to get a few things.

43
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,318
I know the last couple of days

44
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,316
have been insane.
- You know, I must have left

45
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,863
a dozen messages.

46
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,109
Until I got yours
at four o'clock this morning

47
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,982
I thought for sure you were dead.

48
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,371
That's all over now.

49
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:27,700
What's over?

50
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,783
Tell me.
- You know I can't talk about my work.

51
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,914
You've never said
my life was in danger!

52
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,963
Because of my work,
I was targeted by a... a group.

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,882
And I was afraid, by association,
you might be in danger, too.

54
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,048
It's not the case, they're no longer
a threat. That's all I can say.

55
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,886
How do I even know that's true?

56
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,770
You're obviously capable of lying to me.

57
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,098
Please stay and talk.
I'll make breakfast.

58
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,232
No, I'm not gonna do that.

59
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,438
Kat! Hey.

60
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,611
What? Are you
planning on supervising?

61
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,239
What do you want from me?

62
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,233
I don't want anything
from you, Grant.

63
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,031
Not a single thing.

64
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,378
BEEPING SOUND

65
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,999
SHE SIGHS

66
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,338
David?

67
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,512
DAVID:
Hey! I made pancakes.

68
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,567
You probably don't remember
what pancakes are

69
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,253
but I happen to know
that you like them a lot.

70
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,555
What's wrong?
- Uh, nothing, just, uh...

71
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,064
You used to sleep naked when we met,
and I thought maybe you...

72
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,442
Nope.
False alarm.

73
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,160
How long you been up?

74
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,988
Oh, since, uh...

75
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:53,824
All night.

76
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,744
I was thinking of maybe
watching some TV

77
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,500
but then you were
all... wrapped up cosy

78
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,381
on the... on the couch

79
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,334
and I didn't want to wake you,
so, um...

80
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:04,797
then I, uh...

81
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,797
then I... Hey, you know what?

82
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,216
Let's switch things up
and... and you sit here

83
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,750
cos I'm always sitting on this side.

84
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,595
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

85
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,850
Thanks.

86
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,728
Good.

87
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,148
Are you OK?
- Hmm?

88
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,653
Sure!

89
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,406
I don't know.

90
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,366
No.

91
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,657
I mean, a strange man died

92
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,702
right across from where
I eat my cereal every morning

93
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,128
and I'm just having a...

94
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,232
hard time dealing.
- MARCY: David, he was

95
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,719
gonna kill you.
- That doesn't help.

96
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,630
I was the one that
he was looking for.

97
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,337
Well, that definitely doesn't-
- David, it's over.

98
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:49,967
You're safe.

99
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,848
Well, you know that...

100
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,138
does make me
feel a little bit better.

101
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,441
RENE: I thought your parents
were never gonna leave.

102
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,522
They're just worried about me.

103
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,734
Yeah, but the doctor said
it's just temporary, right?

104
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,407
Mm-hmm.
- From the swelling?

105
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,030
Does it hurt?
- No.

106
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,028
You really can't feel anything?

107
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,081
Uh-uh.

108
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,453
Nothing?

109
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:17,953
No.

110
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,333
What about this?

111
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,834
HE GASPS Whoa.

112
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,290
SHE LAUGHS
- Rene...

113
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,502
The nurse could
walk back in any minute.

114
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,423
You can feel that?
- Rene...

115
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,297
Please... Please.

116
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,267
I'm still in recovery.
I should rest.

117
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,602
I shouldn't get too excited.

118
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,978
OK... babe. You rest.

119
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,651
I'll see you tomorrow...

120
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,941
and the next day...

121
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,776
and the next.

122
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,739
Do I seriously have to listen
to that tomorrow

123
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,164
and the next day and the next?

124
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,787
[CURTAI N SWISHES]

125
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:02,870
I almost pressed the call button

126
00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,774
because I thought I was
gonna throw up my lunch.

127
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,627
She's very young.

128
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,174
GRACE:
You're very old.

129
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:09,964
I can't argue with that.

130
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,511
You really don't feel anything yet?

131
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,305
I mean, the amount of
medical nanites I gave you

132
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,872
was barely above
the minimum threshold

133
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,776
but I thought you'd have
some sensation by now.

134
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,461
With age comes patience.

135
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:22,601
How are you feeling?

136
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,932
Like I could walk out of here

137
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,521
but I'll have to fake it
for a while

138
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,132
or they'll think
I'm a medical miracle.

139
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,399
Mm!

140
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,564
Besides, I love
the food in here.

141
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,865
It's amazing! Right?

142
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,247
Carly...

143
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,916
Carly!

144
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,042
What do you want?

145
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,915
How about you answer your phone?

146
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,153
I'm not here to creep,
just to say thanks.

147
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:54,301
You can thank your Sergeant.

148
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:56,085
He's the one that made me
give the statement.

149
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:56,719
Oh, I did.

150
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,967
Listen, I'm just as upset
about Jeffrey Jr. as you.

151
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,188
I'm not even allowed
to see him, Jeff!

152
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,311
No contact.
- Me neither.

153
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,773
You didn't know?

00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,533
INDISTINCT OFFICE CHATTER

155
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:19,992
Hey, partner.

156
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,707
Everything all right?

157
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,918
I just went into
the wrong bathroom.

158
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,713
Back to basic training for you.

159
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,340
What's this?
- Missing persons report.

160
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,506
Doesn't missing persons fall
under local law enforcement?

161
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,587
We come in if there's
an interstate component.

162
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,297
Right.
- All six failed to check out

163
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,508
out of the same hotel.
Left all their belongings.

164
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,307
"Serenity Inn and Suites".

165
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,687
So... So I guess
we have to go there.

166
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,650
Yeah.

167
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,058
We're FBI agents.

168
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,476
Badges and everything.

169
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,649
All right, but, uh...

170
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,443
can you drive?

171
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,820
You just need practice.

172
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,073
Who'd like to start?

173
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,535
Hi. My name is Philip...
and I'm an addict.

174
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,461
THE GROUP:
Hi, Philip.

175
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,631
You know,
the hardest part about this

176
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,300
is admitting to yourself
that you're not strong enough.

177
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,923
Uh, that you can't just stop...

178
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,196
even when you know
what it's doing to you.

179
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,474
I was doing really well,
I was...

180
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,806
and then I lost
somebody close to me.

181
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:28,314
Technically, not, uh,
lost... lost

182
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,230
she's still in my life,
but she's just...

183
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,155
This is impossible to explain.

184
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,736
I feel like she's gone.

185
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,781
At least, a part of her is.

186
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,743
Anyway...

187
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,499
I miss her.

188
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,055
COLIN: Thank you, Philip.
- THE GROUP MURMURS

189
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:50,490
THE GROUP:
Thanks, Philip.

190
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,831
Who'd like to go next?

191
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,090
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

192
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:05,973
Hi.

193
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,311
I'm sorry about your friend.

194
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,438
Thanks.

195
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,858
We need all the support
we can get, right?

196
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,616
I'm Traveler 4514.

197
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,579
The Director assigned me
to help you.

198
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,501
DISTANT SHIP'S HORN BELLOWS

199
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,500
You know, you're right.

200
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,548
A little fresh air is nice.

201
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,966
It's important
not to get fixated.

202
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,640
Was I fixated?

203
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,513
Yeah, I was.

204
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,261
It's normal to be
rattled by trauma.

205
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,439
You just want to make sure
it doesn't tip into something more serious.

206
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:52,607
Like what?

207
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,309
Here, let's sit.

208
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,523
SHIP'S HORN BLASTS NEARBY
- Jesus.

209
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,115
I think you're experiencing
early symptoms of PTSD.

210
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,746
That's ridiculous.
Soldiers in battle get PTSD.

211
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,196
First responders of horrible disasters-
- Heightened anxiety

212
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,753
inability to sleep

213
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,047
exaggerated startle response.

214
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,293
Exaggerated star-
You just made that one up!

215
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,128
I'm fine!

216
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,674
I mean, technically,
it's too early to diagnose

217
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,351
but early treatment won't hurt
and it should help, so...

218
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,894
Here. Come here.

219
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,232
Give me your hands.

220
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,151
I want you to close your eyes.

221
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,373
I want you to think about
what happened to you

222
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:43,355
while you focus on
my tapping... OK?

223
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,658
Seriously?
Is this a real thing?

224
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:50,241
Cos it... it feels
a little bullshitty.

225
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,714
Uh, you know what?
I'm sorry. I, uh...

226
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,882
Could we just keep walking?

227
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,593
Yeah. Good idea.

228
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,519
You know what? I'm gonna head back
to the apartment.

229
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,846
I'll meet you back there.

230
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,726
Where are you going?

231
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,312
To get something that'll help.

232
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,149
OK.

233
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,452
PHILIP:
So your mission is to help me?

234
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,790
Specifically to...
give you this.

235
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,625
Eye drops?

236
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:39,918
Synthetic compound.

237
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,875
To help with
the heroin addiction.

238
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,507
It's invented 20 years
or so from now.

239
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,386
Naloxone, buprenorphine...

240
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,470
and some other things

241
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,097
that are even harder
to pronounce.

242
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,972
But... it will stop the craving

243
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,181
and curb your withdrawal.

244
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,016
And I'm just getting this now?

245
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,775
Hey, I... I know you were trying hard,
but then you had the setback

246
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,698
when you got captured, they gave you...
- How'd you know about that?

247
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,739
The future.

248
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,870
Maybe the Director figured you'd quit
on your own and you couldn't do it.

249
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,957
SHE CHUCKLES

250
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,179
There. See?

251
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,389
It's perfectly...

252
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,929
SHE GAGS AND GASPS

253
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:33,927
COUGHS AND CHOKES

254
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,440
SHE LAUGHS

255
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,018
That wasn't funny.
- Yes, it was.

256
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,108
One drop per eye, as needed.

257
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,284
Jenny, by the way.

258
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,387
These are amazing.
- Yep.

259
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,770
Now what do I do?
- Whatever you want.

260
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,561
What are you gonna do?

261
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:24,945
Did you receive any...
training on the simulator?

262
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,696
You had a simulator?

263
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,273
Wow. OK.

264
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,442
Uh, just loosen up on the wheel

265
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,901
and try to get out of your head.

266
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,078
You know,
sing a song or something.

267
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,123
Doesn't have to be a song.

268
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,121
Just recite something
you know by heart.

269
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,702
Uh, list the protocols.

270
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,664
Uh, Protocol 1. Uh...

271
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,506
mission comes first.

272
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,425
Uh, two, leave
the future in the past.

273
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,919
Better. Just turn up here.

274
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,048
Protocol 3...

275
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,348
don't take a life, don't save a life,
unless otherwise directed.

276
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,016
Good.
- Protocol 4

277
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,097
Uh, don't reproduce.
- Don't reproduce.

278
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,721
<i>TIRES SQUEAL'</i>

279
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,123
I don't know how the hell
you got to work today.

280
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,490
Uh, just like that.

281
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,372
Yeah, well, Protocol 2 isn't gonna
get you out of practicing.

282
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,290
Hold on a sec. Kat?

283
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,200
KATHRYN:
<i>You're right. We should talk.</i>

284
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,707
Great. Uh...

285
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,962
Come by the house tonight.

286
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:26,460
I'll make... / <i>'m staying at
Nicole 29 While she 's away.</i>

287
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,957
I'll text you the address.

288
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,878
<i>Sure. Want me to bring anyth-?
- </i> PHONE BEEPS <i>TO END</i> CALL

289
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,581
JEFF:
Carly, they took away our son.

290
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,845
We need to be on the same side.

291
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,260
CARLY: You charged me
with assault

292
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,311
blocked me from getting a job

293
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,688
told the judge
I was an unfit mother.

294
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,395
You have every right
to be pissed at me

295
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,573
but I did those things
because I was pissed at you.

296
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,650
So how about we stop being
pissed at each other

297
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,950
and see what happens?

298
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,951
When I saw the girl
about to shoot you

299
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,700
I just felt...

300
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,923
I can't imagine what I'd do
if I lost you for good.

301
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,169
Yeah, I guess I never did
thank you for that.

302
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,051
Mm, well, you still haven't.
- Thank you.

303
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,512
You're welcome.

304
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,066
So walk us through
what happened.

305
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,865
The seminar was going great.

306
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,404
I had two buyers on the hook.

307
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:36,530
Maybe three!

308
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,944
And then I...

309
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,955
I left the room near the end,
to go get my manager.

310
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,916
We usually offer a slightly better deal
to really drive it home.

311
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,247
Sure.

312
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,290
Except when I came back,
20 minutes later

313
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,621
they were gone.

314
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:50,715
Twenty minutes?

315
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,417
It's a sales technique...

316
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,969
just let 'em stew on it
a little bit.

317
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,214
Guess it wasn't
such a great deal.

318
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,925
Can you show us
the security footage?

319
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,265
KEY RATTLES IN LOCK
- Mr Conway?

320
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,349
DOOR LOCK BEEPS

321
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,104
Son of a bitch.

322
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,236
That way.

323
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,865
Hey!

324
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,993
OK, fine.

325
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,564
You know, running
from a federal agent

326
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,491
kinda makes it look like
you did something bad.

327
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:28,778
No, I... uh...
- Freeze!

328
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,337
I think I got it, Ace.

329
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,633
Put it away.

330
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:33,516
All I did is look the door
to keep them inside.

331
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,169
I know it goes against
fire code, but-

332
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:37,103
I don't give a shit
about the fire code, Randy.

333
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:38,583
There are six people missing.

334
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,209
I don't know what
happened to them.

335
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,762
I came back and they were gone.

336
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:42,971
I swear.

337
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,643
The security tape?

338
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:46,433
Oh, ah...

MARCY:
Hey.

345
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,785
I stopped by the hardware store
on the way home and uh...

346
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,710
it turns out
they were having a big...

347
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,423
sale on locks.

348
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,421
SNAPS FINGERS
- Yay, safety.

349
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,962
Why don't you have a seat?

350
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,974
RANDY: Now, we only use this
for training purposes.

351
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,520
MACLAREN: We don't care.
- Right.

RANDY TYPES

353
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,140
Can I have one of these?

354
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,814
Sure, yeah,
but they're a day old.

355
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,737
Press play, please.

356
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,928
You didn't tamper
with this, did you?

357
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,723
No. No, I swear.
- You can stop swearing.

358
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,665
Did you have more plans
for the group?

359
00:19:05,994 --> 00:19:07,914
We were gonna shuttle them
to our sister location

360
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,418
to pick up
their free dinner vouchers.

361
00:19:09,513 --> 00:19:10,628
In the shuttle bus outside?

362
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:11,765
Yeah. Yeah, why?

363
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,756
Might want to get
your brakes checked.

364
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,236
What is this?

365
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,864
This is an eye-movement therapy kit

366
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,278
to treat PTSD.

367
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:28,827
Alright.

368
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,867
Follow the light with your eyes.

369
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
I want you to think
about what you were doing

370
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:36,280
moments before the man arrived.

371
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:40,214
I was washing dishes.

372
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,799
Concentrate on how you felt.

373
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,674
MARCY:
What happened next?

374
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,518
Drying the dishes.

375
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,868

376
00:20:00,892 --> 00:20:02,474
of the desensitisation process.

377
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,530
Here, give me your hands.

378
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,282
Close your eyes.

379
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,743
Alright.

He forced his way in.

How did you feel

DAVID GASPING
- MARCY: David.

392
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,243
I'm right here.

393
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,874
Hey. Look at me. Hey!

394
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,581
You're fine.
I am right here.

395
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,127
MARCY: OK?
- DAVID PANTING

396
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,171
You're fine. You're fine.

397
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:03,547
Why do you figure that
they put a hole in them?

398
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,842
Let's concentrate on
one mystery at a time, shall we?

399
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,885
Um... new arrivals cause
static on video cameras

400
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,097
so it's pretty obvious
that it's six new Travelers.

401
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,599
With a total disregard
for Protocol 5.

402
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,562
Well maybe they're
working on a mission.

403
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,691
Let's be sure. In the meantime,
we bury any connection to this hotel.

404
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,313
Philip, are you there?

405
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,443
<i>'Yeah, go ahead..</i>

406
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:27,776
I'm leaving what looks like
the scene of a mass arrival.

407
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,548
Six people in a hotel conference room.
Do you remember anything about

408
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:32,746
<i>a group of Travelers
arriving today in Bel/ingham?</i>

409
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,453
Uh, how were they
supposed to die?

410
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:35,854
<i>I 'm just guessing, but something</i>

411
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:36,788
with a shuttle bus.

412
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,918
Brake failure, maybe?

413
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,812
Nothing like that today, but you know
the timeline's been changing.

414
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,712
Yeah, or maybe they went missing
for a different reason.

415
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,136
What, you mean like
how we went missing?

416
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,589
Let's hope not. I'll keep on it.

417
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,266
Sorry about that.

418
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,599
Oh, must be a relief.
- What?

419
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,147
If you're seeing changes
in the timeline

420
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,271
it'll mean you won't have
to carry the burden

421
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,147
of knowing everyone
who's about to die.

422
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,028
Maybe eventually.

423
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,225
It's amazing how
little has changed

424
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,645
considering everything
we've done.

425
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,077
I know what happened
with Aleksander Andreiko.

426
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,118
Maybe we shouldn't
be talking about that.

427
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,995
JENNY: Hey, I agree
with what you did.

428
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,292
You saved that kid's life.

429
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,920
You know the Director
isn't perfect.

430
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,432
We definitely shouldn't
be talking about that.

431
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,587
Don't forget. We created it.

432
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,344
The Director might not
be able to break rules

433
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,258
but we can.

I feel like I'm waiting
to be struck by lightning.

437

Not a black cloud in the sky.

438
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,071
Come on.

439
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:57,911
Where are we going?

440
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,160
It's a surprise.

00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:07,754
MARCY:
Here.

442
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,047
Is that any better?

443
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,300
I have no idea.

444
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,348
I have another,
different treatment.

445
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,685
Can it be later?

446
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:19,856
Sure.

447
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,279
Although, sometimes,
medicine is the best medicine.

00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,841
I was dreaming.
- About what?

490
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,546
I was walking in the park.

491
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,219
I don't dream much.

492
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,474
I can tell.

493
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,011
Sorry. I shouldn't
have woken you.

494
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:52,191
I'm just used to being able to have
intelligent conversations 24/7.

495
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,828
I thought you weren't
much of a people person.

496
00:26:54,852 --> 00:26:55,887
Who said that?

497
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,400
Ellis.

498
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,277
Oh.

499
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,822
He was right, actually

500
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:04,353
but I was talking
about the Director.

501
00:27:04,377 --> 00:27:07,540
Lamenting those conversations
are over now.

502
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,579
I talked to the Director
a few times.

503
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,411
I talked to it endlessly.

504
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,999
I don't know
what to do with myself.

505
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,592
Protocol 5.
You can counsel children.

506
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:20,716
Please, I said
intelligent conversation.

507
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,472
So you miss the Director?

508
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,969
SHE CHUCKLES
Huh. I think I do.

509
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,554
Interesting.

510
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,266
You miss her, don't you?

511
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,596
I can tell by the way
you look at me.

512
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,773
What you see is my realisation

513
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,734
that, instead of
saving Grace's life

514
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,948
I made her last few
hours terrifying.

515
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,614
I guess I've cheated
death for so long

516
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,788
I thought that I could do the same
for somebody else.

517
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,226
But I've lived long
enough to know better.

518
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,710
Well, try to understand that

519
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,811
faction had already
corrupted the Director.

520
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,375
The grand plan was in jeopardy.
- I understand.

525
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:24,692
You can't be serious.

526
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,157
Edwin Galloway?

527
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,688
Do you know how much hatred
and intolerance this guy inspired?

528
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,953
Immigration...

529
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,536
is the true test of a nation

530
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:38,547
because the nation needs to be
strong enough to survive it.

531
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,466
Too much accommodation...

532
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,421
This guy is a racist click.
I am not watching this.

533
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,721
Shh. Just wait.
- EDWIN: How many people here

534
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,891
today feel like this country is headed
in the right direction?

535
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,394
And how many feel like

536
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,981
their cultures and traditions
are being respected

537
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:59,652
by the people they suddenly find
taking their jobs

538
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,228
dating their daughters?

539
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,983
Well, there's a reason
you all feel this way...

540
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:11,121
Their cultures
don't respect your culture.

CROWD MURMURS

You did that?
- Still not struck by lightning.

550
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:43,983
Here.

551
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,985
No, thanks. I feel fine.

552
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,867
Yeah, but do you want
to feel amazing?

553
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,754
JENNY CHUCKLES

554
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,952
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

555
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,541
Protocol 4, right?

556
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,874
HE INHALES DEEPLY

557
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,175
HE EXHALES SLOWLY
What was I saying?

558
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:55,593
Uh... that you should
sell the apartment?

559
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:56,847
Right.

560
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,977
Although, I think you got
to say if someone died

561
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,810
you know, on the disclosure form.
- Just...

SHE SIGHS Re-stain the floors

563
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:06,478
and nobody needs to know.

564
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,900
See?

565
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,741
That's why you're an FBI doctor.

566
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:16,492
Who am I kidding?

567
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,949
I can't sell this place.

568
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,081
All my stuff's here.

569
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,294
Oh, man. I'm really
feeling this.

570
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,637
I don't feel anything, though.

RAPID TYPING
- INDISTINCT OFFICE CHATTER

572
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,891
FORBES:
Hey, Mac?

573
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,392
Whatever it is, try figuring it out
on your own.

574
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,648
I just did.
Come on, check this out.

575
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,655
Two of our missing people were
just flagged in Sacramento.

576
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,911
Local PD got 'em
for running a red light.

577
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,614
Dale Miller and Meredith Gilroy.

578
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,674
Looks like they don't
know how to drive either.

579
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,539
I suggested that these two
were just having an affair.

580
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:05,542
What about the others?

581
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,090
Technically? No longer under
our jurisdiction.

582
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,133
Local PD took it back.

583
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,128
There's hope for you yet.

584
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,888
Hey.
- Hey.

585
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:25,603
What is this?

586
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,567
I got a present for you.

587
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,528
Wow.

588
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,985
Looks great. It, uh...

589
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,655
it even covers up the-—
- Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

590
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,199
Yeah, I got you a present, too.

591
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,531
Yay, safety.

592
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,366
I'm not gonna be needing those.

593
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,743
I'm not staying.

594
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:45,873
What?

595
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,955
You can continue
the therapy on your own

596
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,049
as you feel you need it.

597
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,553
But I can already tell
that you're getting better.

598
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,965
When did you decide this?

599
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:58,007
I was told my living here
was always temporary.

600
00:32:58,185 --> 00:32:59,945
You can't just buy me
a goodbye rug and then-

601
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:03,007
David... you went through
a traumatic experience.

602
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,708
Yeah, I'm feeling
another one coming on.

603
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:06,478
OK, well, just keep up
with the treatments-

604
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:07,975
Don't talk to me
like I'm a patient.

605
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,980
I'm responsible
for what happened.

606
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,781
You said we were safe.
- You are, but...

607
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,573
you'll be safer without me.
- How is that even possible?

608
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,200
You're the one who saved me.
- And look at the result.

609
00:33:21,224 --> 00:33:24,592
I mean, your anxiety
may never completely go away.

610
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,035
I did that to you.

611
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,708
HE SIGHS

612
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,257
You asked before
if we were intimate, and...

613
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,303
I didn't know what to say
because, I mean...

614
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,370
Well, I don't know,
because I'm an idiot.

615
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,229
What I should have said
was, yes.

616
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,890
We were intimate.

617
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,143
I love you, Marcy.

618
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,610
And you love me.
You just don't remember.

619
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,867
You're right.

620
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:01,949
I don't.

621
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:05,499
But I do care about you.

622
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,039
KISSING SOUND

623
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,373
Enough to leave.

624
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,941
JACQUELINE: I understand
this is a difficult time

625
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:27,965
for both of you.

626
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,649
But the 72-hour
dependency action was filed

627
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,148
and Jeffrey Jr. will be
in the care of the state

628
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,728
until the next assessment.

629
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,279
That's why we're here.

630
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,152
We need to see him.

631
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,325
Not until the next hearing.
I'm sorry.

632
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,946
Trust that he's in a good home.
- I'm his father!

633
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,702
I have a right to see my son.

634
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,829
The action was filed
for Jeffrey's safety.

635
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,919
CARLY:
By who?

636
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,958
It was you, wasn't it?

637
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,670
When we received information
regarding the police incident-

638
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,760
OK. Hold on.

639
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,418
I was cleared of all charges...

640
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,799
I called you, Mr Conniker

641
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:01,547
and we spoke at length

642
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,013
but I understand why you may
forget the conversation.

643
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,056
We also tried unsuccessfully
to contact you, Ms Shannon.

644
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,903
So what do we do?

645
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,988
Based on your current behaviour
and your history...

646
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,236
I think it might be time to consider

647
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:23,160
allowing another guardian
to take care of Jeffrey.

648
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:24,782
Indefinitely.

649
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,327
I'm not gonna give my son
over to some stranger.

650
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:29,041
Unless things radically change

651
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,961
that is going to remain
Jeffrey Jr.'s best option.

652
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,585
MARCY: Philip?
- PHILIP: Yeah! Just one minute!

653
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,465
DOOR CLOSES

654
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:43,842
Who are you?

655
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,388
This is Jenny.
- Hi.

656
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,056
Hello.

657
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,225
Philip, can I talk
to you for a second?

658
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,244
Did you bring a 21st-er to Ops?

659
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,500
Well, actually,
she's a Traveler.

660
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,623
And that's better how?

661
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,498
So I'm gonna go.
- Good idea.

662
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:20,963
Talk to you later?

663
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:26,094
What's going on?
- I'm clean, Marcy.

664
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,180
That's how we met.
The Director sent her to help me.

665
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,931
POCKET UNZIPS

666
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:34,686
A synthesised drug
to help me get off heroin.

667
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:37,605
I need to know
what this is made of.

668
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,440
Naloxone, buprenorphine...

669
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:40,904
and some other things.

670
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:44,279
What other things?
- I don't care. It works!

671
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:47,508
My body doesn't hurt when I'm not high.
I get to have a normal life.

672
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:49,614
There's nothing normal about this!
- Why?

673
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,666
Because I met someone?

674
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,087
You have somebody.

675
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,836
Not anymore.

676
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,043
I'm gonna stay here for a while

677
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,386
until I find my own place.

678
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,134
Of course.

679
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,429
This place is yours, too.

680
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:11,889
You OK?

681
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,058
I'm fine.

682
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:20,939
DOCTOR:
Mr Holden.

683
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,275
TREVOR: Mr Doc.

684
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,655
What's the prognosis?

685
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,767
DOCTOR:
Still a lot of inflammation.

686
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,446
Do you feel anything yet?

687
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:28,948
Even pins and needles?

688
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,449
I think so.

689
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:31,950
It's hard to say.

690
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,872
Well... let's, uh,
do the test again.

691
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:37,873
Ow!

692
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:39,583
Oh, I felt that.

693
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,130
And movement.
That is excellent.

694
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:42,361
Excellent!

695
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,217
So does this mean...?
- It means there's hope!

696
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:45,881
Wow.

697
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,971
Thank you so much.

698
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,909
Would you like me
to contact your folks?

699
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,550
I... I would like that
very much, yes

700
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,164
because they'll want
to thank you, too.

701
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,932
I'll check in again later
before I go today

702
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,354
but how about one
of these, buddy?

703
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,020
Alright.
- BOTH CHUCKLE

704
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,983
Hope?

that I programmed personally,
repairing the damage.

708
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,289
There was never any doubt.

709
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:17,042
Well, I wanted him to feel good
about the job that they did.

710
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,706
Well, I want them
to bring breakfast.

711
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:21,546
They're half an hour late
already, and I'm starving.

712
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:23,999
Thank you for saving me, Grace.

713
00:38:24,023 --> 00:38:25,133
You already said that.

[CALL BUTTON CLICKING REPEATEDLY]

715
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,889
Hi.
- Come on in.

716
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:38,911
Carly, what're you doing?

717
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,120
What do you think?

718
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,960
JEFF: You're not gonna find anything.

719
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,250
I told you, I stopped drinking.
This is for real.

720
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,500
No, Jeff.

721
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,131
This is for show.

722
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,755
And you better not
screw it up...

723
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,214
because this is our one chance
to get Jeffrey back.

724
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,761
JEFF:
Don't worry. It's gonna work.

725
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:00,638
The big question is,
where do I put my, uh... my stuff?

726
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,481
By the couch.

727
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,910
Hey, um, you hungry?

00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,509
The bitchy little blonde?

732
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,389
Marcy is out
looking for an apartment.

733
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,894
That's why I texted.

734
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:47,396
You seen this?

735
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,105
His followers went nuts on him

736
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,484
and then, this morning

737
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:55,276
he woke up,
shot his wife and his kid

738
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,578
before he killed himself.

739
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,144
Philip, I know-—
- His wife and child

740
00:40:58,168 --> 00:40:59,746
are dead and it's our fault.

741
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,077
You mean my fault.

742
00:41:01,156 --> 00:41:02,436
I mean this is fucked up, Jenny!

743
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,701
No. It really isn't.
- None of this would've happened

744
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,401
if you hadn't hacked
his presentation.

745
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,172
He probably would've
gone on spewing hate

746
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,216
that led to the deaths
of hundreds of people.

747
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,801
Thousands!

748
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,171
You tell me,
you're the historian.

749
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,300
It's not up to us.

750
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,849
I didn't tell him
to kill his family.

751
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,511
All I did was tell the truth.

752
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:26,056
And his wife and child?

753
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,813
The world is a better place
without Edwin Calloway.

754
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,446
And I'm sorry

755
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,605
maybe he took some innocent people
down with him

756
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,782
but I refuse
to feel guilty about it.

757
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,183
Yeah, well,
the Director's gonna know.

758
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,912
If the Director thought
what we were doing was wrong

759
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,122
why didn't I get a messenger?

760
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,830
Orders from another
team to back off?

761
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,499
Can you look me in the eye and tell me
what I did was not a good thing?

762
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,274
Kat.

763
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,855
Grant, what are you doing here?

764
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,116
You can't just show up here, when-—
- Kat...

765
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,360
I know.
- What?

766
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,824
That you're pregnant.

767
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,245
What? Did you show your badge
to my obstetrician?

768
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,326
No.
Can I come in?

769
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,756
I saw your supplements
in the bathroom.

770
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,177
You went through my things?
- Yes, I did

771
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,550
and you can give me
shit for that after we talk.

772
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,215
No, I am not doing that.
- Yes, you are.

It happened the night
of your surprise party

775
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,514
the one time we made love
in the past four months.

776
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,644
I just found out.

777
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:55,903
I haven't even decided
to go through with it yet.

778
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,483
It was hard enough before,
when I knew how you felt about me.

779
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,114
You do know how I feel about-
- And if I decide not to

780
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,196
I won't have you standing there
judging me.

781
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,034
This is something we wanted
more than anything.

782
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,746
It's my decision to make,
and I'm gonna do it on my own.

783
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,550

Alright. I can tell you need
a little more motivation.
