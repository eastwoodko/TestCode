It's stable. Wouldn't call it safe.

What does that mean?

15
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,401
That means
don't drop it, don't shake it

16
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,175
don't expose it to heat, don't get it wet.

We never actually met

That's all it says.

148
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,016
It's an experimental crop that's able

149
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,737
to extract more nutrients from the soil

150
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,573
in order to yield a larger harvest,
by 20 to 30%.

nutrients 0589 will pull from the soil.

It's not about sustainability,
it's about profit

00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:16,493
and for the sake of a few years
of record harvests

156
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,511
this crop could decimate
all the farmland that it grows in.

This week.

162
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,404
Well, it would have to
pass FDA regulations.

163
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,032
Not if Bill 939 gets passed

164
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,951
which allows corporations to bypass
the regulatory process

165
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,073
for standard testing.

166
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,282
They want to get it to market
ahead of their competition.

167
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,747
How do you know all of this?

168
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,751
Not here.

169
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,798
Jeff?

170
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,634
Anyone home?

171
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:02,841
SHE LOCKS THE DOOR

172
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:12,088
ABBY: I was pretty excited
when I got the internship.

173
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,393
I thought I could take 'em down
from the inside, you know?

174
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,396
I wrote to our congress,
I wrote to our senator...

175
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,983
I sent reports to the FDA
of their violations.

176
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,656
I even tried blackmailing
one of their private investors.

177
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,781
You go, girl!

178
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,698
SHE LAUGHS
You did not just say that.

179
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,534
Um, anyway, I got just moved

180
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,988
from the labs down to the basement

181
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,253
so all I do now is archive old paperwork.

182
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,491
So, I'm not waiting around anymore.

183
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,048
What does that mean?

184
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,827
I still have access to the building

185
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:39,882
and I have what I need
to do something about it.

186
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,005
That's serious shit you're talking, Abby.

187
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,929
It's also a big job for one person.

188
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,014
I can do it.

189
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,354
You don't think I can do it?

190
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,356
You're not hearing me.

191
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,356

200

ABBY: Whoa... Holy shit.

201
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,509
This place is...

202
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,428
Hey.
- Hello.

203
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:27,847
Abby, Philip.

204
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,786
My hacker friend I was telling you about.

205
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,925
Oh. What'd he say?

206
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,269
Uh, you're the best

207
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,316
I can trust you,
and you want to help.

208
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,567
There's so much more to me.

209
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:40,272
You guys live here?

210
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,360
PHILIP: Mi case.

211
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,539
TREVOR: I still have a room
at my parents' house

212
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:44,571
but I'm here a lot.

213
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,661
ABBY: Just the two of you?

214
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,953
And Poppy.

215
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,289
His pet turtle.

216
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,161
You do know they can carry
salmonella bacteria, right?

217
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,747
Noted.
- TREVOR, CHUCKLES: OK.

218
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,918
Our system is completely secure,
so go ahead and plug in.

219
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,506
KEYBOARD CLICKS

220
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,798
No shame in a little porn. I won't judge.

221
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,428
Rule 34.

222
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,928
She's hilarious.
Where'd you find her?

223
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,057
She found me.

224
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,942
These are the project work files

225
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,645
on 0589 I managed to swipe.

226
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,604
I've gone through some of it,
but a lot of it's encrypted.

227
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,908
What's the timeline we're working on here?

228
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,452
The Bill 939 vote is tomorrow.

229
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,287
Galston won't waste time.

230
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,332
The labs are always empty
between 11:00 and 1:00 for lunch.

231
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,539
That's our window.

232
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,747
DOCTOR:
The heartbeat sounds good.

233
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,585
The kidney, liver, brain,
all developing very well.

234
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,716
This is just what we want to see
at this stage.

235
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,761
Now, there was one area of concern
that we saw.

236
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,219
This dark spot here,
just behind the placenta.

237
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:53,974
KATHRYN: What is it?

238
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,855
Too early to say for sure

239
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:58,980
but we would be concerned
if it were a blood clot.

240
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,399
Have you experienced any spotting

241
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,022
any contractions recently?

242
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,279
No.
- What would a clot mean?

243
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,907
It could be the early signs
of a placental abruption.

244
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,489
But it could be nothing?

245
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,036
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

246
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,915
There's no need for either of you
to worry at this time.

247
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,292
But given your age
and your history we're gonna...

248
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,543
we're gonna keep a close eye on this.

249
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,418
80, best to make an appointment
with my office

250
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,921
come back and see me
in two weeks. OK?

251
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,091
OK.

252
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,844
MACLAREN: The doctor said
it might not be anything.

253
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,721
I know what the doctor said

254
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,981
and I've been through this before.

255
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,547
That's not going to happen this time.

256
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,477
That's not in your power.

257
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:45,322
Oh, shit!
I left my phone in there.

258
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,378
Wait for me in the car.
I'll be two minutes.

259
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,706
Thank you.

260
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:59,624
Marcy? You got a minute? I... I...

261
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,717
I didn't want to have this conversation
over com.

262
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,948
What?
- I need a favour.

263
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,251
Yeah, of course.
- One that breaks protocol.

264
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,268
I need you to understand
this happened the night

265
00:14:09,292 --> 00:14:11,533
we were all under
the effect of the anti-toxin.

266
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,638
Which you don't remember.

267
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,352
We briefed you on the Helios mission

268
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,554
this was the night after,
we were all affected.

269
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,309
OK.

270
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,188
Well, my wife had helped to arrange
a surprise party for me

271
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,020
and I... I didn't realise the effect
the drug was having,

272
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,856
I consumed too much alcohol.
- You broke protocol 4?

273
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,912
And that puts her at, what?
Twenty weeks?

274
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,202
Something like that.
This is not her fault.

275
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,327
No, it isn't.

276
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,287
It's yours.
- I know.

277
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,370
What were you thinking?
- I... wasn't, obviously.

278
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,086
Alright. It'll probably still be best
if you took her to a clinic.

279
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,884
The procedure's safe, even at this stage.

280
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,090
She's going through with it.

281
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,553
It's her decision to make.

282
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,052
Well, talk her out of it.
- I'm not gonna do that.

283
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,637
No.

284
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,394
We just came from the ultrasound.
There's a problem.

285
00:14:58,418 --> 00:14:59,418
Placental abruption?

286
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,642
Yeah.

287
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,266
That's serious in any century.

288
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:06,145
Yeah, but you could improve her odds

289
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,526
of carrying the baby to term, right?

290
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,237
There is a drug I could technically
synthesise, yes

291
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,817
but you know that I can't do that.

292
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,990
I'm asking you to think about it.

293
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,291
I need to get back to work.

294
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,547
Hey, Marcy.

295
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,419
Dr Barker.
- Uh, so is he your, uh...?

296
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,551
My boyfriend? No.

297
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,169
Excuse me.

298
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,216
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?

299
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,592
Sure. When?

300
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,262
How about... how about this weekend?

301
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,226
How about now?
I just got to go change.

302
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,978
Oh...

303
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,148
OK, then.

304
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,493
I'll be giving my speech from here.

305
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,417
Yeah. That's a decent vantage point.

306
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,245
From which to shoot me?

307
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,463
That's why we're here.

308
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,131
I was told there'll be
a distraction at 11:27am.

309
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,341
Yeah, we're aware of that.

310
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,798
It's blocks away,
but the sound should carry.

311
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,218
Why don't you check out your spot?

312
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:22,891
You alright?

313
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,606
This is plan B.

314
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,273
My original mission from the Director
was a little more long-term.

315
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,071
Rise in the ranks of government,
maybe high office.

316
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,032
Unfortunately, my host
has a heart condition

317
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,322
the Director wasn't aware of.

318
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,658
You've still done great things
as a congressman

319
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,534
things that your host wouldn't have done.

320
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,369
Been paying attention, have you?

321
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,075
Felt I had a vested interest.

322
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,833
The Director has fattened me up
like a lamb being led to the slaughter.

323
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,182
All I've done in the short time
I've been here

324
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,966
is set myself up to become a martyr.

325
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,299
We all have our part in the grand plan.
- Yeah, yeah, it is what it is.

326
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,552
Oh, I want to ask...
that woman in the stasis field.

327
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,889
What was she to you?
Worth risking your life for?

328
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,368
Someone I care about that was
not supposed to be on the plane that day.

329
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:12,649
She made it?

330
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,356
Yeah. She did.

331
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,742
Well, that makes one of us.

332
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,113
HE SIGHS

333
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,073
It'll be quick, right?

334
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,883
DR BARKER: Thank you.
- MARCY: Thank you.

335
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,054
DR BARKER:
Um... to courage.

336
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,346
To courage.
SHE LAUGHS

337
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:47,809
So...

338
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,183
what drew you to health care?

339
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,068
God, that is an awful question

340
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,396
to lead with. I am so sorry.

341
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,073
No. It's... It's fine.

342
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,524
No, no. It's, uh...

343
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,785
I don't know what it is about you.

344
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,788
You're so...

345
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,164
At some point, I'm gonna need you
to finish that sentence.

346
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,632
Every male in the entire hospital

347
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,639
would be jealous of me,
if they knew where I was.

348
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,924
This must be a really
good restaurant, then.

349
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,840
I mean, with you.

350
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,262
Obviously.

351
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,022
Uh, well, I got into health care

352
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,100
because, in the future,
it's gonna be more important than ever.

353
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,446
I know. And we're just on the cusp
of so many amazing things.

354
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,151
Mm.

355
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,988
Why'd you become a doctor?

356
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,738
Um, similar reasons to you, really.

357
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,782
I want to be part of the changes
that are coming.

358
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,917
Think of what we're able to do now

359
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:52,871
that we couldn't even ten, 15 years ago.

360
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,957
Brain mapping, stem cell research

361
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,583
robotically-assisted surgeries...

362
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,132
Limitless ways to help people.

363
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:02,742
I mean, isn't that what it's all about?

364
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,302
You have a very positive view
of the future.

365
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,598
Yeah, don't you?

366
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,184
I do.

367
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,734
Here you go.

368
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,241
Thanks.
- What are you writing?

369
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,326
It's like a mission statement.

370
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,093
I want people to know why we're doing this.

371
00:19:27,117 --> 00:19:29,859
You don't think that bombing
a research lab makes a statement?

372
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,327
I don't want people to think
that I'm some radical.

373
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,237
There's a point to this.
- Yeah, that's why we're helping you.

374
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,799
I've been doing some reading.

375
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,964
0589 is worse than you think.

376
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:42,090
How?

377
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,676
There are properties in the genetic
mutation of the seed that are monophyletic.

378
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,282
Mono... what?

379
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,912
It means that the organisms descend
from the same common ancestor.

380
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,267
In this case, the kudzu

381
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,816
a weed known for completely
taking over a territory.

382
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,477
So if farmers start using 0589...

383
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,235
Not only will it deplete the soil of
nutrients, it will spread. Rapidly.

384
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:04,237
With its genetic resistance to pesticides

385
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,827
0589 could become impossible to contain.

386
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,491
He's right.

387
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,817
All arable land on the planet
could be choked out in decades.

388
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,495
You guys really know your shit.

389
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,554
I don't really have a life
outside the Internet.

390
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:20,410
And I'm getting an A in biology.

391
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,614
No, thank you. Uh-uh.

392
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,244
Yeah, I spent many years

393
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,412
very, very close to an old person

394
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,179
who had to fight for every breath he took.

395
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,701
You trying to ruin this for me?

396
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,955
Nah. You're an intelligent person.

397
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,455
You can make your own decisions.

398
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,297
SHE CHUCKLES

399
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,304
ABBY SCOFFS

400
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,100
So what do we do now?

401
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,728
We can look at the stars.

402
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,981
Nah, there's too much light pollution.

403
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,070
I can only see one.

404
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,319
Sirius.

405
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,279
Huh.

406
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,036
There's... There's another one.

407
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,699
That's Mars. That's a planet.

408
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,497
I defer to your astronomy expertise.

409
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,876
Astrology, unfortunately.

410
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,040
My mum was into it.

411
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,302
She based all her decisions,
all her relationships

412
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,926
on bullshit like whether Jupiter
and Mars were aligned.

413
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,007
BOTH LAUGH

414
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,768
You know, most belief systems
are just

415
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,187
a shared vocabulary
for people in search of meaning.

416
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,855
I think maybe the important thing
is to just believe in something.

417
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,861
You mean something spiritual?

418
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,359
Something.

419
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,901
I don't believe in anything.
- Yeah, you do.

420
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,412
You believe in humanity.

421
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,291
You believe that our future's at stake.

422
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,211
That's not spiritual.

423
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,879
Yeah, it is.

424
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,469
THEY LAUGH
- What?

425
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,671
God, who are you?

426
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,680
I mean, where were you
when I was in high school?

427
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,183
It would've been nice to have at least
one interesting person to talk to.

428
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,852
Well, I'm kind of an old soul.

429
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,147
Yeah, no kidding.

430
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,152
I like it.

431
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,657
I, uh... I should get back in there

432
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,037
and see if Phil...

433
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,204
Yeah.

434
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:25,495
See if Philip needs help finishing up.

435
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:29,257
So... don't light up while I'm gone.

436
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,549
SHE LAUGHS

437
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,718
SHE SIGHS

438
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,261

439
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,020

Good to go.

PHILIP TYPES

441
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,942
Do you remember when Hall said

442
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,240
"Don't think the future doesn't
get its hands dirty"?

443
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:03,499
I know how you feel.

444
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,203
But we knew, going into this

445
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,459
that there's some parts of history
we can't change.

446
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,468
Some people still have to die.

447
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,264
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,772

451
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,531
MACLAREN: Morning, Congressman.

452
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,362
MacLaren.

453
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,866
Not much of a turnout.

454
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,356
It's far more important the event's covered
by news the outlets, and they're all here.

455
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,292
You know, for what it's worth-
- It's worth nothing.

456
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:52,086
It's a life thrown away on the vague hope
that one man's death can turn a tide.

457
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,583
I wish I'd never volunteered

458
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,339
but here I am.

459
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,299
You are going through with this?

460
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,264
Don't worry, I'll play my part

461
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,054
however pathetic it might be.

462
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,762
Well, then again, you might just change
the world.

463
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:08,348
I know the Director believes that.

464
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,825

The device is set for 11:27

470
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:50,638
so when you have it in place, here,
on the second floor...

471
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,252
I flip the engagement switch
and get the hell outta the building.

00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:54,311
You got it.

473
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,773
Alright.

474
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,656
OK. Here we go.

Yeah.

478
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,584
I should go.

00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,411
I can hack into Galston

00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,536
Are you OK?

649
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,457
Yeah.

650
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,334
Long day.

651
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,462
Come on.

652
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,883
I'll be in my room.
Answer the phone if Mum calls.

653
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,428
Chloe?
- OK.

654
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,254
Ready?

655
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,258
MARCY: How did you even find this place?

656
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,092
They're turning this old government
building into condos soon.

657
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,365
Jeff brought me here to look at the view...

658
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,479
Mm.
- Wants to buy one.

659
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,521
<i>Seems</i> like this address
might be a little out of your price range.

660
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,938
Everything he likes
is a little out of our price range.

661
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,277
Likes to dream, that man.

662
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,862
So... you two?

663
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,405
We three.

664
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,650
That child is why we're doing this.
That's the only reason.

665
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,951
Is it?

666
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,617
He did stop drinking.

667
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,413
I got a zero-tolerance thing going.

668
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:34,049
We both love that boy, so.

669
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,629
MARCY: Hmm.

670
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,465
I met a guy.

671
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:40,717
You did?

672
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:42,761
Doctor.

673
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,571
Well, at least you have
something in common.

674
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,333
Yeah, I don't know. I don't really
think there's anything there.

675
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,357
EXPLOSION

676
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,109
Galston Agriculture's that way.

677
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,398
Trevor?

678
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,527
Trevor, where are you?

679
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,403
Come in!

680
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:01,905
Trevor?

681
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,528
<i>Sorry, I was visiting my parents.</i>

682
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,330
<i>Couldn't talk. You guys hear that?</i>

683
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,369
Yeah. We saw it.

684
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,791
Had to be Galston.

685
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,749
Someone just completed our mission.

686
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:24,808
Traveler 3326, open memory chain 71985VX

687
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,635
and store the following sequence.

688
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,437
Biosynthesis of the glycoproteins IgE

689
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,686
IgM, IgD, IgA, IgG.

690
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:35,393
Cleave H A protein to form HA-1, HA-2

691
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,687
and fuse with BHK21-F.

692
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,650
Ribonucleic acid compounds
mRNA and tRNA.
