Told you.

24
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,122
Yeah, then we got lost.

00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,908
How long till impact?

26
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,828
Twenty-three minutes, six seconds.

Ish?

28
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,797
No, pretty much exactly.

29
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,209
I'll have to call her after the mission.

30
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,424
I don't understand the big deal about
anniversaries anyway.

31
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,676
My father missed their 25th
a few months back.

32
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,725
And?

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,801
Gary paid a heavy price, boss.

Fortunately, Kat's a reasonable person.

35
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,770
MARCY: Reason's got nothin' to do with it.
You're already in the doghouse.

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,442
Oh, come on.
- No, she's right.

37
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,104
Your window was early this morning.
It's already closed.

38
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,818
How do you know this information?
- Covered it in training.

39
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,323
"21st-Century Female Behaviour."

40
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,777
Ah. Well, I'll buy her flowers, then.

41
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,952
What anniversary is it?

42
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,746
MACLAREN: Ten years.
- Yikes.

43
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,997
Whoa.

44
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,950
Ah, you're screwing with me now.

45
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,911
No, ten's a big one. Even I know that.

46
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,122
OK, well, help me out.
What's an appropriate gift for ten years?

47
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:56,127
Tin.

48
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,458
Yeah, ten.
- No, "tin."

49
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,042
As in the metal.
- Tin?

50
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,377
That's the traditional gift.

51
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,672
I'm supposed to give her something
made from tin?

52
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,473
If you're a traditionalist, yes.

53
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,432
There's a more modern anniversary theme
for ten years but you're not gonna like it.

54
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,725
Diamonds.

55
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,229
Now I know you're making this up.
- Technically, diamond jewellery.

56
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,608
Yes.
- Seriously?

57
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,237

with flowers, if you'd called.

Nah. Probably a splash,

Um, can you just tell me where
Alouette Lake is?

- Where did the Fraser meteor come down?

148
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,373
A dry lakebed just north-east of here.
Why?

149
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,245
It wasn't dry this early in the 21st.

150
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,752
What's going on?
- I just got off the phone with a Traveler

151
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,357
who requested armed assets to the exact

152
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,791
same coordinates the meteor
was historically found, 50 years from now.

Do we know when the meteor came down?

160
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,977
I'm no historian,
but I'm about to bet my job at the FBI

161
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,812
that it's sometime in the next 15 minutes

all the Faction members.

Only Faction members it could get eyes on.

Nah. Probably just a splash.

177

Nothing too big.

178
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,950
Just extremely rare

Well, then, help me out.
What's an appropriate gift for ten years?

211
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:27,976
Tin.
- Yeah, ten.

212
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,314
No, "tin".

213
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,279
Like soup tin?
- TREVOR: As in the metallic element.

That's the traditional gift.

00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:37,034
I'm supposed to give her something
made from tin?

216
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,911
You cut the deployment close.
What happened?

217
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,746
We collided. He's unconscious

before we separated.

If he lands like that, he'll break his

- Weapons.

No.

Really?

Explain how buying something
hard and shiny, and artificially expensive

238
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:03,215
because it's controlled by a cartel,

I'll chip a fragment off the meteor

I know you're probably busy on a case
and I married an FBI agent

262
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:46,242

“won't be by tonight, work”

263
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,695
in a text, it just means

00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,048
Well, if it's rare and precious she wants

332
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,600
I'll chip a fragment off the meteor
after we recover it.

333
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,143
It could come in handy

334
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,520

a high-temperature superconductor

Hello, Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

365
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:22,711
This is your apparently-not-so-special
wife of ten years

366
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,129
as of today.

367
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,582
Ten years, Grant.

368
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:28,922
I left you a phone message

369
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,296
and I sent you
a Happy Anniversary text before that

370
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,884
but neither really cover the range of
emotion that I'm feeling at the moment.

371
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,387
All I can say is,
you bloody well better be

372
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,267
shopping in a jewellery store right now

373
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,520
that happens to have shitty cell phone
reception.

374
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,272
Call me back when you get this.

375
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,084
Yeah, I said it was nice.

If you mean with Kat and the pregnancy...

387
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,924
The pills you gave me-
- This isn't the time or the place.

388
00:33:00,948 --> 00:33:03,235
No, I know. I was going to ask about you.

389
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:05,726
I'm fine.

390
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,270
I don't think you are.

391
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:11,858
Part of the team leader's job is to have
some inkling about the general welfare...

392
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,689
I said that I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

393
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,319
You're unhappy.

394
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,407
Look, Marcy, you can't possibly
remember this, but...

395
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:20,909
I didn't want to be reset?

396
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:22,990
Someone told you?

397
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,125
We should just get back to the mission.

398
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,628
No. There's plenty of time.
Let them take care of it.

399
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,749
Look, I didn't see the good in telling you
that information

400
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,083
and maybe I was wrong

401
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,339
but it's pretty obvious to me

402
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,133
and probably everyone else

403
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,886
that the new Marcy is
different from the old one

404
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,308
in ways she wouldn't approve.

405
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:44,890
She?

406
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,475
That's your word.

407
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,607
Well, hers.

408
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,750
I just...

409
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:13,548
SHE SIGHS

410
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:17,177
I just can't help but feel
that I'm not really...

411
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,216
What?

412
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,802
Whole.

413
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,974
That when Grace
sent my consciousness to the future -

414
00:34:26,523 --> 00:34:29,106
repackaged it,
and then sent it back again, that...

415
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,102
she left out what made me “me”.

416
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,529
That very day

417
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,955
you told me you were afraid of losing the
most important part of who you had become

418
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,333
in your short time in the 21st.
- How do I even know what that is?

419
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,331
I don't think it's my
place to say, but I...

420
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,125
I can give you a hint.

421
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,305
After that plane crash
that should've killed me

422
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:12,190
when you and a million nanites
were trying to put me back together...

423
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:14,355
my own consciousness

424
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,358
took refuge in the memories
of Grant MacLaren.

425
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,862
Well, that's not possible.
There are none.

426
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,451
Only a few.
Disconnected fragments.

427
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,083
Of What?

428
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,165
Of how much Grant MacLaren loved his wife.

429
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,835
Memories even his death couldn't erase.

430
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:44,556
How do I possibly access that?

431
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,849

do a little camping.

440

- Fishing.

441
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,614
What about you? What are you up to?

442
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,151
About 15,000 feet.

443
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:47,913
We're going skydiving.

444
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:50,577
Oh! That sounds... terrifying.

445
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,165
You know, it's...

446
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,867
Oh, yeah. No. It'll clear up.

447
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,875
You know, statistically,
it's actually safer than driving.

448
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,047
So people tell me.

449
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:00,332
You should try it sometime.

450
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,423
No. I'm not... I'm not so good
with things in the sky.

451
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,215
OK.

452

455
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,273
And I'm married. I know.

456
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,396
Uh, speaking of which...

457
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,983
Your wife just texted you,
saying “Happy Anniversary”.

458
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:24,194
What? Shit!
- Yeah.

459
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,695
You might wanna give her a call.

460
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,495
She didn't have any fresh fruit
like you asked

461
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,415
so I got you something called
a “fruit pie” instead.

462
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,376

489
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,586
We should just get back to the mission.

490
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,132
No. There's plenty of time.

491
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,301
Let them take care of it.
- SHE SIGHS

492
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,638
Look. I didn't see the good in telling you
that information

493
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:36,886
and maybe I was wrong

494
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:40,970
but it's pretty obvious to me,
and probably everyone else

495
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,647
that the new Marcy is
different from the old one

496
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,974
in ways she wouldn't approve.

497
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,606
That very day,
you told me you were afraid of losing

498
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,112
the most important part
of who you had become

499
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,069
in your short time in the 21st.

500
00:40:57,163 --> 00:41:00,121
How do I even know what that is?
- I don't think it's my place to say

501
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,076
but I...

502
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,453
I can give you a hint.

503
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,915
GUNSHOT

504
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,378
After the plane crash
that should've killed me

505
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,428
when you and a million nanites
were trying to put me back together...

506
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,845
my own consciousness took refuge
in the memories of Grant MacLaren.

507
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:27,352
But how do I possibly access that?

508
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,392
You're the doctor.

509
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,779
WAYNE, IN DISTANCE:
MacLaren!

510
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,777
Did you hear that?

511
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,832
HE WHEEZES

512
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,749
Oh!

513
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,014
MacLaren!

514
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:03,722
GUNFIRE

515
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:24,948
Identify yourself.

516
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,741
Traveler 5008.

517
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,582
I'm on a Protocol Alpha mission...
- We know, it's all over.

518
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,707
Marcy, all clear!

519
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,243
No, there's one more down the road.
I had to go around him.

520
00:42:33,267 --> 00:42:35,884
I took care of him first.
We did it.

521
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,673
Thank you both.

522
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,175
That was close.

523
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,923
You don't know how close.

524
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,557
HE PANTS

525
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,135
We weren't the first.

526
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,723
We had to keep trying.

527
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,475
How many times?

528
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,519
I was the ninth volunteer.

529
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:52,142
Jesus.

530
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,777
If the element ended up
in the hands of the Faction

531
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,529
the whole Traveler program might never-

532
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,860
DISTANT BANG

533
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,494
See? Just a splash.

534
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,459
Our mission is to recover and secure the
meteorite upon impact, so...

535
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,629
We'll stay here and watch your back
till you're done.

536
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:17,189
I'll have him patched up by then.

537
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,886
There's one other thing.

538
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,090
We have your next mission.

539
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,305
OUTBOARD ROARS
