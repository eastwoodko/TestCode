158

00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,399

160

when I really needed someone.</i>

164
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:26,198
<i>In another time
or another life, right?</i>

165
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,494
<i>'Goodbye, David..</i>

166
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,332
See?

167
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,528
MAN SHOUTING OUTSIDE:
This is bullshit!

168
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,301
Jesus, he's having a bad day.

169
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,007
Are you fucking kidding me?

170
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,714
Hey, Jeff, keep your voice down.

171
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,131
I told you what happened.

172
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,546
The optics suck, and you know it.

173
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,468
It's on the news,
you shot a 13-year-old kid.

174
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,270
That was about to shoot Carly.

175
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,643
Who also murdered her mother
and brother last night.

176
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:55,026
That kid?
Number 2 pencil to the head, both of them.

177
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,686
Girl was certifiable.

178
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,856
Now, get Carly's ass down here
to make a statement

179
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,113
and you're just the poor bastard
who had to stop her.

180
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,035
OK, Carly's
not answering her cell.

181
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,863
We've been having trouble at home.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,867
In the meantime, buddy, I'm sorry,
but I gotta take your badge.

183
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,455
Forensics already got your gun.

184
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,371
Oh, come on, this is bullshit, man.
Let me just go down the hall

185
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,626
and talk to him.
- Hey, no.

186
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,004
Not with booze on your breath, OK?

187
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,587
Hey, if I was forced to shoot a kid,
I might have a few drinks, too.

188
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,801
This is gonna work itself out.

189
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,050
Just go home.

190
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,896
I can see there's a fight
going on inside of you.

191
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,734
If you're worried about Kat-...

192
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,370
She is completely in the dark
about this.

193
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,749
She called me earlier
to tell me that you sent her away.

194
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,013
That your life was in danger
and so was hers.

195
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:55,072
Is that true?

196
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,213
It's what made me put a team
together to come after you.

197
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,656
We were tracking your car,
and then it disappeared like it went into

198
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,341
a dead zone...
- HE STAMMERS: Yes, but...

199
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,680
she's alright?

200
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,182
If you don't talk, you won't walk

201
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,103
which means Kat may never, ever find out
whether you are dead or alive-

202
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,230
Destroy the device, Walt.

203
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,355
Please.

204
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,566
I'm begging you.

205
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,363
Look, I probably
shouldn't tell you this

206
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,323
but I have also been told
that that device is far beyond-

207
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,535
DOOR LOCK BEEPS

208
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,287
Thank you, Agent Forbes.

209
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,169
I'll take it from here.
- Look, I need more time.

210
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,333
Seriously?

211
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,000
You're telling him
more than he's telling you.

212
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,177
But, hey, thanks for trying.

213
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,341
Walt...

214
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,381
remember what I said.

215
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,302
AGENT WAKEFIELD:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, destroy the device.

216
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,767
He heard you the first time.
We all did.

217
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,061
DOOR SLAMS

218
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,480
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

219
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,821
DR PERROW:
Are you feeling threatened, Vincent?

220
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,785
VINCENT:
No, I have defences in place.

221
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,868
Deuterium oxide
in the radiant heating system

222
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,291
acts as a fair
space-time attenuator.

223
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,460
It slows neutrons.

224
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,168
Don't worry,
it's not radioactive.

225
00:13:21,843 --> 00:13:24,881
Uh... Why wouldn't they just
assume that you died on 9/11?

226
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,178
Why do you think that
they're still after you?

227
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,674
Because they've already
found me twice.

228
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,974
VINCENT:
<i>/ found my way out of New York</i>

229
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,055
<i>and took a train
to the Pacific Northwest.</i>

230
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,376
<i>I had the money and the stock certificates
I'd taken from the safe</i>

231
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,653
<i>but if I was going to stay hidden,
I needed more.</i>

232
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,859
<i>'Historically, there was'</i>

233
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,152
a man named Oliver Norton,
became a tech millionaire on his own

234
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,612
and all I did was insert myself
into the process

235
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,368
as invisibly as possible,
and take my fair share.

236
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,037
VINCENT: <i>lhad convinced
Oliver that I had debilitating phobias</i>

237
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,589
<i>difficulties dealing with people,
privacy.”.</i>

238
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,967
<i>I needed a front man
for my company</i>

239
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:09,843
<i>that uses proprietary computer software
to predict market trends.</i>

240
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:11,882
<i>Of course, I wouldn't let
anyone see it</i>

241
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,011
<i>{not even him..</i>

242
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,765
<i>As long as the predictions
were correct, he didn't care.</i>

243
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,895
<i>'In fact, he was so grateful'</i>

244
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,723
<i>he constantly
wanted to reward me.</i>

245
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,818
And that's when Oliver
introduced me

246
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,816
to the woman
who became Taylor's mother.

247
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,030
Buddy!

248
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,408
Meet your new assistant.

249
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,457
Assistant?

250
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,100
Hi, Vincent, it's a pleasure
to meet you-

251
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,829
No, no, I don't
need an assistant.

252
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,001
Oh, yeah. You do.

253
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,608
I got a company
I gotta pretend to run.

254
00:14:41,632 --> 00:14:44,255
No, sorry, I can't-—
- Trust me, alright?

255
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,582
I already told Irene
all about how you like to do things.

256
00:14:46,606 --> 00:14:48,756
No cell phones,
portable radios, webcams.

257
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,086
No life, no fun...

258
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,005
And I completely understand.

259
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,932
Me, I don't like crowds.

260
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,767
I... I'm not sure I'll have
anything for you to do.

261
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,919
High-maintenance people always think
that they're low maintenance.

262
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,067
You need this, partner.

263
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,721
VINCENT: <i>It wasn't
an assistant I needed</i>

264
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,031
<i>{it was human contact...</i>

265
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,659
<i>and Oliver must have known that..</i>

266
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,878
You said in our initial session
that your wife died of an aneurysm.

267
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,581
Yes. That was the first time
I was discovered.

268
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,710
TAYLOR:
Dad?

269
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:29,551
You know I'm not to be disturbed
when I'm in this room.

270
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,379
Sorry, but Pepper wants out,
and Mr Morraca isn't around.

271
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:37,142
Well... alright, take her out then.
I'll watch you from here.

272
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,555
TAYLOR:
OK.

273
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,098
Hi.

274
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,641
Hello.

275
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,310
TAYLOR:
Come on, Pepper.

276
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,017
He looks like you.

277
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:50,106
Fortunately for him, he looks like the host
who provided the chromosomes.

278
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,194
Not me.

279
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,414
David Mailer?

280
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,290
Yeah.

281
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,548
I'm your lawyer.
- I don't have a lawyer.

282
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,334
Philip Pearson said
you might want my help.

283
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,263
I don't know Philip Pearson.
- Friend of Marcy?

284
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,300
Marcy? Oh, my God, yes.
Is she OK?

285
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,638
Are you...

286
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,228
what are you, like a...
FBI lawyer?

287
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,389
Wow. No. No.

288
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,666
Jeez, uh, he said
she said you were special

289
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,250
but I didn't realise
you were "special".

290
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,605
HE SIGHS:
Well, this...

291
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,364
Sorry, this is...

292
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,701
I... I'm not good at this.
This is so not my thing.

293
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,534
Well, David, fortunately
this is my thing

294
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:40,864
and I am very good at this.

295
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:46,870
So... we're probably
looking at 10 years tops

296
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,500
nine with good behaviour.

297
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:51,962
What?

298
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,803
Nah, just fuckin' with you.

299
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,763
Why would you... Oh, my God.

300
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,896
This isn't how actual law-enforcement
officers behave, MacLaren.

301
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,607
There's giant chunks of time
missing from your logs.

302
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,352
It's a miracle we didn't catch on
to you people sooner.

303
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,891
"You people",
what does that mean?

304
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:14,443
Agent Forbes says, compared
to just a few months ago

305
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,275
you are like a different person-
- Jesus!

306
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,110
Take my blood,
take my fingerprints

307
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,764
take whatever you need-
- Who now spends

308
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,201
half his time
with a high-school senior

309
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,498
his counsellor, a single mum

310
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:28,245
a heroin addict, a farmer, and...
this one kills me...

Philip Pearson is my CI
on a hacking case.

313
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,381
We suspected the device had
something to do with hijacking internet-

314
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,466
Let's skip over the part
where you pretend

315
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,222
there's a legit scenario

316
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,895
where those people,
in a fucking barn

317
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:47,981
with whatever that device is

318
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,350
makes any sense whatsoever.

319
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,153

320
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,525

321
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,947
we're on to you now.

322
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,001
I'm a single mum.

323
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,120
There's a lot of folks like me.

324
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,924
This is gonna sound weird,
and possibly insane

325
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,323
but I'm just gonna
go ahead and say it.

326
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,673
I have a turtle at home,
and I had to leave in a hurry

327
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,209
and there was
a lot of broken glass-

328
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,473
You think this is funny?

329
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,848
No.

00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,815

That's not me.

00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,111
It's clearly you.

342
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,244
I have no memory of this.

343
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,490
Don't I get a phone call
or something?

344
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,533
Who do you want to call?

345
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,251
My babysitter for one.

346
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,379
Jeffrey Jr is in the hands
of Washington Family Services.

347
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:36,501
What?

348
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:37,919
Why?

349
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,751
No, he needs to be
with his mother!

350
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,048
God, how long are you
going to keep me here?

351
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,633

00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,221
PHILIP OVER COM LINK:

What are we doing?

00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,267
Let me see it one more time.

359
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,150

Don't forget I was

00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,402
Right.
This isn't a good time.

I took his legs out.

00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,659
He went down pretty hard.
- Marcy?

377
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,884
It's probably just a concussion.

378
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,379
He'll live. OK, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,839
Come on.

Hey!

381
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,035
That looked like it hurt.

382
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,075
Well, they didn't try to kill anyone,
so you owe me a buck.

383
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,099
What's their progress?

384
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,168
Almost to the gym.

385
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,879
Alright.

386
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,469

No. It isn't.

00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,005

399
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,458

DOOR OPENS

401
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,625
It seemed odd, considering
you built the thing.

00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,154
Hey, but now that you're here,
maybe you can show us what it does.

404
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,013
obviously.

405
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,349
Sorry.

406
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,896

410
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:38,993
Is Trevor OK?

411
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,246
He's out of surgery,
and we've stopped the bleeding.

412
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,498
What the hell happened?

413
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:47,086
All I can tell you is that your son was
involved in a shooting

414
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,625
and that the bullet we removed
in order to save his life

415
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,007
was lodged dangerously close
to his spinal cord.

416
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,380
There's still
a great deal of inflammation.

417
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,719
Can we see him?

418
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,846
DR MORI SIGHS
Tomorrow at the earliest.

419
00:23:58,187 --> 00:23:59,222
So he's gonna be OK?

420
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,805
I'm confident
Trevor will survive this.

421
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,352
He's very strong.

422
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,478
But you should know
there's a possibility

423
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,651
he may not regain
the use of his legs.

424

DR PERROW: How old
was Taylor when his mother died?

425
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:18,908
A baby.

426
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,411
I'd spent the latter half
of my life before this one

427
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,422
being eaten away by a disease
that doesn't exist yet.

428
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,839
I never imagined
the possibility of family.

429
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,004
A loving wife.

430
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,843
A child.

431
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:42,767
Irene was convinced that I'd be angry
when she told me about the baby

432
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,690
afraid I'd think
she'd trapped me.

433
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,148
But how could she know that

434
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:54,156
that in the future I'd left behind,
life was so precious...

435
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,198
And new life, so rare

436
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,571
most precious of all.

437
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,285
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

438
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,200
Just as she couldn't have known

439
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,161
that a stolen moment while I slept

440
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,507
a small token of a perfect memory...

441
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,927
would be the instrument
of her death.

442
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,554
HER EARS RING INTENSELY

443
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,191
An image of me, taken on a cell phone

444
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,860
time and place recorded

445
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,436
and posted to a friend

446
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,030
discovered and acted upon.

447
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,445
Vincent, I think...
- You see, we knew

448
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:41,659
it was possible to send messages
directly to the 21st through a host

449
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,157
but we projected a 40% chance

450
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,794
that an adult mind might not be able
to withstand the shock of transfer.

451
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,955
That's the whole reason
I volunteered to go first!

452
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,011
No one would have to die
that wasn't going to die-

453
00:25:54,035 --> 00:25:55,342
OK, let's just stop-

454
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:57,469
Artificial Intelligence
isn't supposed to be capable

455
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,114
of taking a life
that isn't about to end.

456
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,626
The Director shouldn't have risked it,
don't you understand?

457
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,220
No!

458
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,144
Not one part of what you just said.

459
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,562
I apologise.

460
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:17,531
Vincent, I can't help you

461
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,030
if I don't understand
what you're saying.

462
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,365
Of course.

Hey, guys...

465
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,846
I just want to say

466
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,970
whatever happens
from this point...

467
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,011
be proud of what you accomplished.

468
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,561
I still think,
in the grand scheme of things

469
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,772
we did good.

470
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,652
I know we did.

471
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,357
And I still have faith

472
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,572
the Director will find a way.

473
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,784
I believe that with all my heart.

474
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,786
Just...

475
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,623
maybe not with us.

476
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:17,258
You all know
what you have to do.

477
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,429
Boss, could you be
a little more specific?

478
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,800
Self-destruct.

479
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,643
Obviously.

480
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,933
What?

481
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:32,602
In three...

482
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,439
Two...

483
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:40,151
One.

Sorry, Wakefield

490
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,836
you had that coming.

491
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,175

Well, that's my work day.
Text me if anything happens.

INDISTINCT CHATTER

500
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:48,200
We've gone long past the time
I allotted for this visit.

501
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,528
I was wondering if we could start fresh-
- No, I...

502
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,621
No, I'd rather you stay
a little longer.

503
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,452
Vincent, these delusions...
- Memories.

504
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,841
Are a very complex product
of severe paranoia.

505
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,010
I can't...
- I told you they've found me twice.

506
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,467
They?
- The Director.

507
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,426
Alright.
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

508
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,304
Tell me about the second time.

509
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,682
It was a year later.

510
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,485
The company had become
quite successful...

511
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,028
You're not gonna believe
how well that meeting went.

512
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:26,087
Meeting?

513
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,325
Yeah, with the venture capital
company, I told you.

514
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:29,931
I told you it was a bad idea.

515
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,530
They made an offer.

516
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,284
Now, I didn't commit because...
- No...

517
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,981
because they want your software, too

518
00:30:36,005 --> 00:30:37,005
but-
- No.

519
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,036
Eighty-seven million dollars!

520
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:43,627
Say "no" again, I dare you.

521
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,420
Oliver, I told you from the beginning.

522
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,470
OLIVER: I thought we were
supposed to be partners!

523
00:30:47,494 --> 00:30:48,825
This is my software.

524
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:53,133
I've told you, if we affect the market
in any tangible way it just doesn't work.

525
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,392
Yeah, OK, one, why is that?

526
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,887
And... And two, who cares?

527
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,190
If we can sell the company
for 87 million?

528
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,733
I'm not taking "no" for an answer.

529
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,896
You're gonna hear them out.
- Oliver, wait. Wait!

530
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,073
HE SIGHS

531
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,414
There is no predictive software.

532
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,709
It doesn't exist, it never has.

533
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,457
All the computers out there,
the software

534
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,880
it's just for show, it's a front.

535
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,177
Then... how have you...
- I'm doing it.

536
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,639
No one could have guessed
large market trends

537
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,345
that accurately and that often.

538
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,397
That's true, I'm not guessing.
I'm remembering.

539
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,318
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

540
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:50,072
It means you can't sell
the company, Oliver, I'm sorry.

541
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,443
You can't use that in here-
- Yeah, I'm breaking the rules

542
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:58,027
because you're out
of your fucking mind!

543
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,203
If I had stayed silent,
he might have lived

544
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,081
but the FCC was investigating
the company

545
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,496
and they had tapped his phone.

546
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,542
Voice recognition and GPS
allowed them to find me

547
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,759
the moment I spoke...

548
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,173
Oliver, please, I told you.

549
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,429
Stop, please, I told you,
it's dangerous.

550
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:15,802
I said, stop!

Callahan.
- Any idea what's up?

562
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,936
Wakefield just sent me
a message to come here.

563
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,924
Yeah, most of us
all got the same message.

564
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,138
He does this.

565
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,739
OK, here I am.

566
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,403
What's so important?

567
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,858
I was going to ask you the same thing.
You just texted me.

568
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,657
I what?

569
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,075
Yeah, me too.

also died of an aneurysm?

575
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,944
Yes.

576
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,235
And you became sole owner
of the company.

577
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,364
Yes.

578
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,113
You think I killed them.

579
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,286
I told you, it was the Director.

580
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:57,001
You have nothing
to be afraid of, Dr Perrow.

581
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,048
I feel so much better

582
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,972

of all that baggage.

I feel nothing but gratitude.

585
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,225
Great.

586
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:15,068
Well, if you don't mind,
I'll be, uh, heading home.

587
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,795
My daughter will be wondering-
- Of course, I've kept you too long.

588
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,824
And your cell phone
and payment, in cash

589
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,991
is ready outside.

590
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,658

another appointment, please.

00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,506
you need medication.

594
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,005
I'm not helping.

595
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:40,427
Of course you are.

596
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,047
It doesn't even matter
that you don't believe me.

597
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,390
I get to talk to someone

598
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:51,185
who affords me the privacy
of doctor-client privilege

599
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,015
and you get paid
a great deal of money.

Grace?

603
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,293
Shh!
I had to sneak in here.

604
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:18,965
What are you doing?

605
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,211
I'm sharing the medical nanites
I was given by D-13

606
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,841
so that you'll be able to walk again.

607
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:24,932
I overheard them talking.

608
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,265
Oh.
- Thank you.

609
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:28,887
You're welcome.

610
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,810
It's going to quadruple
my recovery time

611
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,638
but I suppose you're worth it.

612
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,103
So there's no sweet
nanotech for me again?

613
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,358
The Director left me out?

614
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,196
You've lived longer than any human
in history, and you're complaining?

615
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,191
I'm starting to take it personally.

619
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,044
Yes, and I am a...?

621
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,835
Oh, yeah.

622
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,167
I'm sorry, I'm all drugged up.

623
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,294
I got shot.

624
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,222
I stepped in front of you,
remember?

625
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,302
Oh, wow, you did.

626
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,222
Thank you for saving me, Grace-

627
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,479
OK, now shut up and heal.
I need to concentrate.

I know he was a friend.

00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,172
the moment Wakefield
and his team opened it up.

636
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,054
Which made all of you host candidates.

637
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,478
I heard it happening.
How many?

638
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:56,771
Twenty-five of us in the gym,
including Wakefield.

639
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,269
What about the-
- The Quantum Frame.

640
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,025
It's being dismantled
and scrapped.

641
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,648
HE SIGHS

642
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,108
So, that's it?

643
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,653
That's it. It's over, Grant.

644
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,450
Mac. You call me Mac.

645
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,698
They shorten everything
for some reason.

646
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:16,833
Mac...

647
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,624
I'm gonna need your help
with a lotta things.

648
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,880
Welcome to the 21st.

649
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,597
SHE SIGHS HEAVILY

650
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,352
LOUD KNOCKING
- SHE GASPS

651
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,902
Thank you.

652
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,782
MOBILE PHONE VIBRATES
- SHE GASPS IN FRIGHT

653
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,254
Do you really think it's ethical
to plant a bomb

654
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,436
and then take over the people
who would have died

655
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,541
when that bomb went off?

656
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:17,306
How is that not
circular reasoning?

657
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,773
No way the Director would
allow that level of technology in the 21st.

658
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,321
The Director was the one
who had it ordered built

659
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:24,605
in the first place-
- Hey...

660
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:27,480
a wise man once told me,
take the win.

661
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,151
Hey.

662
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,574
They wouldn't tell me much

663
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,224
but I got a quick look
at the monitors

664
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:35,034
at the nursing station, and...

665
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,285
they're both gonna recover.

666
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,117
Well, I'll take that win, too.

667
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,041
Come on, everybody,
I'll drop you home.

668
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,297
I think I'm gonna stay.

669
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,587
He would.

670
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,394
I've decided
I'm not gonna kill you.

671
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,977
<i>Oh.
HE CLEARS THROAT</i>

672
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,227
Good.

673
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:06,901
I was gonna ask.

674
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,855
I mean, there must have been
some kind of power struggle

675
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:11,599
back and forth when all that
was going down.

676
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,243
Who knows where the order
came from, right?

677
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:18,447
Well, at least it's settled now.

678
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,078
Still...

679
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,168
it must have been hard for you.

680
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,719
Thanks for the lift.

681
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,572
David...

682
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,114
It's the middle of the night.

683
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,825
It won't come out.

684
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,745
I mean, you'd think...

685
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,834
they'd properly clean up
something like this, you know?

686
00:41:09,858 --> 00:41:13,192
All those people here, every one
of them capable of holding a mop.

687
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,795
But nah, they're just
gonna leave a...

688
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,014
a giant blood stain and <i>a...</i>

689
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,513
a business card with the number
of a cleaning service.

690
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,556
I'm surprised they
took away the dead body.

691
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,222
I'm sorry that
you had to go through that.

692
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,892
He was a John Doe by the way

693
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,019
which I found fascinating.

694
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,188
Yeah, not just no ID

695
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:34,568
no record at all.

696
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,770
But you probably already knew that.

697
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:43,244
Ray's a heck of a nice guy.

698
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:46,835
Here, let me help-
- Nah, I got it. I'm trying, uh...

699
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:48,499
I'm trying baking soda.

700
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:51,127
You know, the good news is

701
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,667
apparently, the Indian lady
that lives next door

702
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,001
whose name I never knew

703
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,587
told an Officer Boyd

704
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,682
whose name I do remember
for some reason

705
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,055
that the person
that came into her apartment

706
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:07,185
was a stocky bald man
with a thick Canadian accent.

707
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:12,318
Those Canadians, man...

708
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,528
you gotta watch out.

709
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,652
But I'm sure you knew
all about that, too.

710
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:18,783
David, here...

711
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,443
Stop, stop-
- Now all I have to do

712
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,949
is make myself available

713
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,720
for future questioning
whatever that means.

714
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,995
That's good.
- Oh, it's wonderful.

715
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,040
Can I do anything?

716
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,297
Can I make you some tea?

717
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:39,842
Um...

718
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,307
You know, I've had about 57 cups

719
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,634
so I'm... I'm a little wired.

720
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,478
What can I do?

721
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,607
This is nice.

722
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,911
Why don't you take the bed tonight,
I'll take the couch, OK?

723
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,830
You know,
I think I will tonight.

724
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,083
I'm really tired.

725
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,790
OK.

726
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,297
So, how was work?
