1
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,215
Targeting far left.

2
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:23,520
PHILIP: T.E.L.L. established.
Stand by. Target two.

3
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:28,775
T.E.L.L. established.

4
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,691
HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING

5
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,199
Traveler incoming on target one.

6
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,493
MACLAREN: Take him out.

7
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,414
I'm 3468.

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,467
5401.

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,510
Yeah, he's dead.

10
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,209
We needed three to make it even.

11
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,343
He was gonna kill both of you.
- MACLAREN: Stay calm.

12
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,358
Stick to the plan.
I'll be right behind you.

13
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,695
DOOR OPENS

14
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,068
What are you doing?
- What do you mean? It's lunchtime.

15
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,277
You're supposed to be on sentry duty.
- Oh, Jasper's still out there. It's fine.

16
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,507
No, it's not fine.

17
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,278
There could be Travelers out there.

18
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,537
They're in here now.

19
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:24,657
Don't.
- Hands in the air.

20
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,374
Your protocols won't let you take a life.

21
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,881
Protocol 3 has been suspended
for members of the Faction.

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,925
I wouldn't risk it.

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,500
CARLY: Weapons down, hands up.

24
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,260
Where's the quantum frame?

25
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,681
Not here.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,806
Secure them.

27
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,427
What're you gonna do with us?

28
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,103
That'll be up to the Director.

29
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,643
So death by overwrite.

30
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,683
You mean like you did to your hosts?

31
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,477
Our plan might have saved the future.

32
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,854
You people are pathetic.

33
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:59,241
Meaning we're capable of pity,
sympathy, or compassion for others?

34
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,661
I've really been enjoying English class
this year.

35
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,538
Yeah, I can see that.
Let's get moving.

36
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:05,583
CARLY: Move.

37
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,797
Stay still.

38
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,131
OK, let's see what we can pull from this.

39
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,519
You won't find anything.
- MACLAREN: I don't know.

40
00:02:24,543 --> 00:02:26,222
My people are pretty good at this.

41
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,136
Thanks, boss.

42
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,189
Be good at this.
- Mhm.

43
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,439
We can always try torture.

44
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,818
No, we couldn't.

45
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:36,858
They've been in hiding so long, I doubt
they know where the frame is anyway.

46
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,989
Even if we knew, we wouldn't tell you.

47
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,901
So someone point a fucking camera
this way and end this.

48
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,953
I'm good with that.

49
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,657
The Director has plans for them.

50
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,616
This is the first I'm hearing about it.

51
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,660
Because you are a part of those plans.

52
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,328
A hearing has been ordered.

53
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:56,041
Your presence,
along with 3569 and 0115, is required.

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,093
Where?
- You'll receive the coordinates tomorrow.

55
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,698
CORK POPS

56
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,212
To selling our house.

57
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,128
To selling our house over asking.

58
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,041
Yay!

59
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,459
We're officially homeless.

60
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,002
Well, I am.

61
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,545
Not till you finish packing.

62
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,268
I don't know how you can drink this stuff.

63
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,223
Because I'm not allowed to drink that stuff

64
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:53,353
and the calcium is good
for the development of bones.

65
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:55,816
You haven't touched the
almond milk I bought.

66
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,901
Grant, if there was ever a time you were
gonna lose this vegan battle with me

67
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:01,337
it's when I'm pregnant.
- Fair.

68
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,900
You know, I was thinking,
we should put some of our house money

69
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,240
into a trust fund, for
college tuition and...

70
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,370
College?

71
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:09,826
That's years from now.

72
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,658
You need to learn to think of the future.

73
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,333
Oh, I... I have given that some thought.

74
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,338
And I think...

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,507
I'm gonna buy a boat with my half.

76
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,128
Given your history with the water

77
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:27,139
I'd better take a life-insurance policy
out on you instead.

78
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,846
Ow. Break one arm one time...

79
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,550
HE SIGHS

80
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,032
Were you planning on going back
to the house tonight?

81
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,489
It's early.
Are you kicking me out already?

82
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,990
No.

83
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,655
I'm asking you to stay.

84
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,755
You haven't changed position
since I left last night.

85
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,799
Oh. No, I guess I haven't.

86
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,428
Find anything on the coms?

87
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,264
They've been all over the place.

88
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,267
This data is pretty much useless.

89
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,483
CARLY: What about these points?

90
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,990
Looks like they frequented these locations
multiple times.

91
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,528
Maybe the frame's there.

92
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,490
Where the frame might have been,
not where it is now.

93
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,290
Well, there's gotta be CCTV or traffic cams
in those areas.

94
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,535
Maybe you can pull the footage,
see if any of them picked anything up.

95
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,125
If the Faction left anything on
those cameras - and hey, I wouldn't -

96
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,791
then the Director would've already
found it by now.

97
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,011
HE GROANS

98
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,013
HE SIGHS

99
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,260
Something's bothering you.

100
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,345
The timeline has changed a lot.

101
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,761
My knowledge of the future
is becoming obsolete.

102
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,350
It's going to be hard to stay relevant.

103
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,983
You're more than just the team's
encyclopaedia, Philip.

104
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,322
Who else am I gonna call when I can't get
Jeffrey's cartoons to play on my phone?

105
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,366
So flattering.

106
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,405
Or make me music playlists...

107
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,535
Teach me about turtles...

108
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,656
The self-worth
is just coursing through my veins.

109
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,325
You're like the rest of us now.

110
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,999
Just a human being.
And that's OK.

111
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,592
I gotta go to work, but I'll com in.

112
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,348
Have a nice day.
- Go for a walk!

113
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,569
THEY LAUGH

114
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,283
Oh! My... God.

115
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,833
I guess we were making up for lost time.

116
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:00,743
Lost time?

117
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,502
I don't even know what day it is.

118
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,582
SHE LAUGHS I know.

119
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,044
I'm gonna be in court all day, so...

120
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,597
I'll be hard to reach.

121
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,093
But I'll see you tonight?

122
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,899
How's that for an answer?

123
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,871
Grant?

124
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,416
I love you.

125
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,378
I love you, too.

126
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,382
ROBOTIC VOICE:
3468. Coordinates are as follows.

127
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,843
47.6050 degrees North

128
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,930
by 122.3344 degrees West.

129
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,270
GIRL: Why am I in the hallway?

130
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,269
Is it time for school?

131
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,859
Not yet.

132
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,276
Are you our new neighbour?

133
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,197
I guess I am.

134
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,150
Have a nice day, neighbour.

135
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,177
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

136
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,230
He asked first.

137
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,602
A messenger gave me the coordinates
for a hearing.

138
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,890
Scared me half to death.

139
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,731
Maybe it's their trial.

140
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,654
Shouldn't take long then.

141
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,747
All rise for the arrival
of the Tribunal Committee.

142
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,801
INTENSE HIGH-FREQUENCY SOUND

143
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,472
SOLDIERS SCREAM

144
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,485
SILENCE

145
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:42,620
I'm Traveler 009.

146
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,081
You may refer to me as the Speaker.

147
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:49,669
I'm joined by Travelers 0017 and 0029.

148
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:50,920
They're programmers.

149
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,047
What the hell are all of you doing here?

150
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,460
Who's maintaining the Director?
- 0027.

151
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,221
We came to the 21st as instructed
by the Director.

152
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,558
Unlike yourself.

153
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,552
So that's what this is about?

154
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,849
0027, you are charged with conspiracy
against the Director

155
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:13,019
and the high crime of interrupting
the Grand Plan.

156
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,872
POP MUSIC PLAYS

157
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,673
I liked that one.

158
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,086
Can you add it to my playlist?

159
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,724
And just like that,
I am reduced to being Carly's DJ.

160
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:45,287
SHE CHUCKLES

161
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,722
Something upbeat, please.

162
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,055
Any luck with the footage?

163
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,599
They wiped everything,
just like we thought.

164
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm running serial numbers
of the weapons they were carrying.

165
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,312
Grasping at straws here.

166
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,824
They're bound to slip up, and when they do,
we'll be ready for them.

167
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,989
<i>'Dropping by Ops after work?</i>

168
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:07,664
No, I gotta pick up Jeffrey from the
sitter, get some groceries, and...

169
00:11:08,311 --> 00:11:09,311
SHE SIGHS

170
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,746
bring my van to the mechanic.

171
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,875
I've been having trouble starting it
in the mornings.

172
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,455
Maybe I could be a mechanic.

173
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,170
I do live in a garage.

174
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,458
CARLY SIGHS:
<i>Stop</i> it.

175
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,422
You're a valuable member of the team.

176
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,008
And a great DJ.

177
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,514
Next song, please.

178
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,724
PROGRAMMER:
3468, please take the stand.

179
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,990
Recount to us how you first made contact
with 0027.

180
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,289
MACLAREN: I met Grace several months ago,
when my team was given a mission

181
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,126
to greet Traveler 0014, Ellis.

182
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,505
Grace arrived at the same time
and said her mission was to help Marcy.

183
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,461
PROGRAMMER:
But that was a lie, wasn't it?

184
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,003
No, it wasn't. I saved her life.

185
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,472
The defendant will
refrain from interjection.

186
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,633
If you refrain from leading questions!

187
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,176
Go ahead. He interrupted you.

188
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,099
Later, we learnt she was actually here
to reset the Director

189
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,392
by taking advantage of Marcy's new T.E.L.L.

190
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,146
And you were unaware of
this secondary objective?

191
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:23,407
She eventually told us. Prior to that,
we believed that she was only here

192
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,816
to save Marcy.
- Which I did.

193
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,701
And for which I am deeply grateful.

194
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,746
You're welcome.

195
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,077
PROGRAMMER: At any point, did you suspect
that she was a member of the Faction?

196
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,959
MACLAREN: In the future we left,
there was no Faction.

197
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,744
Protocol two has kept us in the dark.

198
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,256
We had no idea.

199
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,924
And who wrote protocol two?
- Oh, come on! You know I did.

200
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,380
0027, please.

201
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,762
Teams in the 21st shouldn't be made
aware of every change in the future

202
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:49,345
because completion rates of our missions
would drop exponentially.

203
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,011
You have been asked by the tribunal
not to interject.

204
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,664
Operatives would be
paralysed by the fear of

205
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:55,276
how their actions
could negatively affect

206
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:56,818
the people they left behind.
- Enough!

207
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:57,871
I agree!

208
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,066
If I hadn't reset the Director,
the Faction would have corrupted it

209
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,857
which means the Faction
would have control of the past.

210
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,823
What I did was the only way to save Marcy
and the Director.

211
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:14,075
It was the Director who ordered
this hearing, not any one of us.

212
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,127
Why?

213
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,170
It knows what really happened.
It knows what I sacrificed.

214
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,419
This... This makes no sense.

215
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,500
And yet here we are.

216
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,718
We will take a brief recess to allow
that fact to sink in.

217
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,772
Blair, hi, it's David. I...

218
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,938
Hi! You're still at home.

219
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:49,743
Yeah, I was just calling to leave a message
to wish you a happy birthday.

220
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,404
So, uh, happy birthday.

221
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,875
Yeah.

222
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:58,919
Anyhoo, that's the one and only reason
I was calling, so have a great...

223
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,247
A rave?
HE LAUGHS

224
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:03,925
Oh.

225
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,385
No.

226
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,631
No, no, I don't, um...

227
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,179
I don't do rave.

228
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,975
It's just not my...

229
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,019
Tell you what, I'll say maybe.

230
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,065
And, uh...

231
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,145
Yeah. I'll try.

232
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,608
Yeah, I'll... I'll try to maybe
see you later.

233
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,528
OK. Yeah, bye.

234
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:35,663
0115.

235
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,036
Were you responsible for interrupting
Grace Day's original T.E.L.L.?

236
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,089
I was.

237
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,539
Whose orders were you acting on?
- No one.

238
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,382
Then Why'd you do it?

239
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,713
I didn't want her to die.

240
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,762
That simple.

241
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,136
As a Traveler, you don't just inherit
the host body, you inherit

242
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:55,516
the lives they've touched -
family, friends...

243
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,222
Grace Day was merely
a guidance counsellor...

244
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,683
at your host's high school.
- That doesn't do her justice.

245
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,984
See, my host was a bully.

246
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,446
Cruel.

247
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,230
She tried to help him anyway.
She was there for him.

248
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,659
For me.

249
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,030
SPEAKER: And historically,
she was supposed to die.

250
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,913
I rationalised that one person
wouldn't matter to the Grand Plan

251
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,699
but I was lying to myself.

252
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,161
I broke protocol because
she did matter to me...

253
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,497
and I'm willing to accept the consequences.

254
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:31,970
Because of your actions,
0027 locked out all transfers to the 21st

255
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,506
until she could send herself
into the host, Grace Day

256
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,015
halting the Traveler programme

257
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,893
for four hours.
- I couldn't just go into anyone.

258
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,738
PROGRAMMER:
Dozens of missions were cancelled.

259
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,909
A Traveler was supposed
to arrive in Germany

260
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,934
and prevent an impending
train derailment.

261
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,564
All the passengers died.

262
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,523
A team meant to arrive in England
and stop a terrorist attack

263
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,531
was unable to transit.

264
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,896
TREVOR: I assumed that the Director
would choose a new host

265
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,278
for the next scheduled Traveler.
- The Grand Plan is fluid.

266
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,909
It's constantly shifting.
The Director is constantly analysing

267
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,292
a myriad of outcomes and course-correcting
to the fraction of a second.

268
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,829
Are you trying to school me in the matrix
of algorithms the Director uses

269
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,247
to oversee the Traveler programme?

270
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,207
SPEAKER: For the last time, 027...

271
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,715
TREVOR: If the crime is disruption
of the Grand Plan, then I'm the one

272
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,219
that allowed that to happen.

273
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,385
I'm the one that should be punished.

274
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,435
SPEAKER: The Director will no doubt take it
into account.

275
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,814
You may step down.

276
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,366
2103, will you please take the stand?

277
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,159
Oh, seriously? That guy hates me.

278
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,757
Philip, I have a situation.

279
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,752
Hey, what's the good news?

280
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,796
Definitely not my pay cheque.

281
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,633
How the hell do they expect people
to live on this?

282
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,890
And the capitalist-socialist debate
strikes again.

283
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,931
Well, this isn't enough for me
to cover my expenses this week.

284
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:06,939
Can you top me up?

285
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,316
<i>Sure, let me see what
I can move around for you.</i>

286
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,454
This can't be right.

287
00:17:28,107 --> 00:17:29,107
What? What is it?

288
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,920
Something happened to the market this
morning when I was out for a walk.

289
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,301
Our investments are down.

290
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,134
I'm scared to tell you how much.

291
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,552
How did that happen?

292
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,343
<i>Most of our higher-risk investments
just crashed and burned.</i>

293
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,513
We're in serious financial trouble.

294
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,143
This was a meeting Ken had
been preparing for for a month.

295
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,233

Even had his hair slicked back, which is a
clear sign that, you know, it's important.

Uh, no. No, I'm not.

Anyway...

302
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,088
So we're all sitting there, and he
stands up to do his presentation

303
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,549
and his fly, it's wide open.

304
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,463
Oh, no.

305
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,676
Was his penis exposed?

306
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,430
Uh, no...

307
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,519
No, I mean, that would... that would be...

308

But, anyway, there's <i>a...</i>

309
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,310
window in his office and I think,
midway through, he must have

310
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,399
caught his reflection,
because he just...

311
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,282
he just knew.

312
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,322
And there was nothing he could do about it,
but you could see him debate it

313
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,329
in his head, like, "Do I do up
my fly while I'm still talking?"

MARCY: Faction took everyone at the rave
except three women

403
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,211
who were apparently
in the bathroom.

404
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:24,494
We found them overdosed, probably a way of
eliminating them as witnesses.

And they survived?

but she didn't see anything.

But it's a safe bet everyone else
in the photo's a Faction.

408
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,092
It makes sense, but I don't know how
you prove it.

Not looking good for Grace.

PROGRAMMER: Marcy.

00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:51,605
How and why did 0027 "repackage"
your consciousness?

415
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,868
Well, obviously, I don't actually remember

416
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,530
but from what I was briefed on
she showed me a code.

417
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,873
Something that Ellis created.

418
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,663
A backdoor hack...

419
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,831
which, during the repackaging process
somehow managed to reset the Director.

420
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,550
Admittedly, a brilliant piece of work.

421
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:13,905
Thank you.

422
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,923
And how has that worked out for you, Marcy,
this "reset" of your consciousness?

423
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,261
Uh, how is this relevant?

424
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,309
I restored her.

425
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,850
Do you feel restored, Marcy?

426
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:24,512
I no longer have seizures.

427
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,351
But do you feel as you did before?

428
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,694
No.

429
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,980
But that's partly because I have no memory
of my time spent in the 21st prior.

430
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,365
There are missing pieces, then?

431
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,370
Yes.

Marcy...

433
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:42,867
I've studied your MRls.

434
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,874
She had to have taken out
more than just a few months of memories.

435
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,878
What else did you take out?

436
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,836
I told you.

437
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,342
Redundancies, useless things.

438
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,387
Such as what?

439
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,387
Empathy? Emotions you lack?

440
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,345
Oh, shut up, 29.
You're practically a sociopath yourself.

441
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,435
How could you do that to me?
- You would have died!

442
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,721
Yeah, but that would've been
my choice to make.

443
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:07,730
You used me.

444
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:08,731
Yes, I did!

445
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:10,062
I prevented your suicide.

446
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,819
Life is precious, and so are skilled
operatives in the field.

447
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,354
I was just a means to an end.

448
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,444
Marcy, you're still you. I swear to you.

449
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,650
I didn't take your soul.

450
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,068
How would you even know?

451
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,584
Carly, I think I found one of the people
in the picture.

Forget the first three.
What do you think of four and five?

453

Not a big fan of Mason.

But it's so masculine. Like a stonemason.

480
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,243
Oh, it's happening.
- Come on, there you go.

481
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,408
OK. Thanks. You can let go now.

482
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:52,998
Wasn't so bad, was it?

483
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,921
I do feel a slight release of endorphins.

484
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:56,966
You see?

485
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,295
Do you have a regular sex partner?

486
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,269
You can't hate every one I come up with.

487
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,931
<i>Well, we don't even know
if we're going to have a boy or girl!</i>

488
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,482
You think I'm getting too excited.

489
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,143
You know what? You're right.
- N... No.

490
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,984
No, I love to hear the excitement
in your voice when you're...

491
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,861
talking about new life.

492
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,952
<i>'Kat, I gotta get back into court..</i>

493
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,239
Just... Just narrow it down
to the top 100 or so

494
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:32,408
and we'll go through it tonight, OK?
- OK.

495
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:36,663
SPEAKER: 0027, you have heard the charges
against you.

496
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,085
What do you have to say in your defense?

497
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:46,052
I've given it a great deal of thought,
run the events over and over in my mind

498
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,888
a thousand times, and to be honest...

499
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,726
You should all be thanking me.

500
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,070
Like my very dear friend
just pointed out...

501
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,114
Uh-oh.

502
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:06,530
If I hadn't have reset the Director,
none of you would be here right now.

503
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,778
The Director would be gone,
the Faction would have won

504
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,244
and billions of people
would be dead from a horrible plague.

505
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,293
So...

506
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,671
You're welcome!

507
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:23,255
0027, the members of the Tribunal
will now deliberate.

508
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,605
We will announce your
final verdict tomorrow.

509
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,223
We are adjourned.

510
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,734
KNOCKING

511
00:29:45,636 --> 00:29:46,636
May I help you?

512
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,901
Stacey Collins, we have a few questions.

513
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,536
How do you know my name?

514
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,782
You were at a rave last night.
Do you recognise this?

515
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:55,916
Where's the quantum frame?

516
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,969
You're standing right beside it
in the picture.

517
00:29:58,993 --> 00:30:00,412
We know you're Faction.

518
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,082
SHE SCOFFS
What are you talking about?

519
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,421
We know you just arrived.

520
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,551
Maybe if you cooperate-
- Who are you people?

521
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,384
Get the fuck away from me.
I'm calling the police.

522
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,830
Whoa! Carly.

523
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:14,764
She's Faction.

524
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,813
How do we prove it?

525
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,809
Who do we prove it to?

526
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,394
This is what happens when you improvise.

527
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,106
We can't just walk away.
- That's exactly what we have to do.

528
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,272
But maybe we can follow her or something.

529
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,325
SIRENS WAIL

530
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,652
Jesus! She actually called the cops!

531
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,874
Take care of yourself, OK?
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

532
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,506
OK? Bye.

533
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,217
Yes, bye.

534
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,930
B... Bye...

535
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:51,307
Bye-bye.

536
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,226
HE SIGHS

537
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,349
You do know Chinese food is my kryptonite.

538
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:02,353
Oh, I just... I know you've been going back
and forth from the hospital all day

539
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,769
so I wanted to bring you some dinner.
- Yeah! Thank you.

540
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:06,155
I am starving.

541
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,234
How's Blair doing?

542
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,737
Alright. Well, we got there just in time.

543
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,078
It was a lethal dose of fentanyl.

544
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:16,916
On her birthday.

545
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,538
So they're gonna keep her
for the next couple of days.

546
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,546
Mm.

547
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,874
You're looking at me funny. What?

548
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,928
I'm just trying to figure something out.

549
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,485
I'm sorry. I wasn't100% finished chewing.

550
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,531
Marcy, stop.

551
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,075
Why? What is it?

552
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,536
Let's, um...

553
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,704
Let's not, OK?

554
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,497
You don't want to.
- Oh, no, I do. I mean...

555
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,788
I really... But...

556
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,045
Not like this. Not...

557
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:12,302
Not like an experiment to see how
it makes you feel.

558
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,140
Because I... I know...

559
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,887
I know how it made me feel
when we made love.

560
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,856
And it's as close as you can get to another
person for 10 minutes.

561
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,738
I mean, an hour.

562
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,113
I want to feel that.

563
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,400
But you can't make yourself feel something.

564
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:37,073
I mean, you either do or you... you don't.

565
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:38,873
And I want you...

566
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,291
to want 1:0.

567
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,379
I know that sounds like a bad song title
from the 803, but...

568
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,791
Should I just go?
- No! No, stay.

569
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:54,678
Share this with me,
and we'll make some tea

570
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:55,884
and, and...

571
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,220
we'll talk, like we do on Tuesdays.

572
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,188
What should we talk about?

573
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:06,859
THEY CHUCKLE

574
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,611
With you, Marcy, I could
talk about anything.

575
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,452
0027, you've been charged with conspiracy
against the Director

576
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:24,242
and interruption of the Grand Plan.

577
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,540
You took a host that
wasn't intended for you,

578
00:33:26,552 --> 00:33:28,663
and you halted the
Traveler programme for-

579
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,555
You've already said all that!
Cut to the chase.

580
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,130
You've repeatedly stated that your actions
reset the Director

581
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,466
and freed it from corruption.
- Because they did.

582
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,515
Then who corrupted the Director
in the first place?

583
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:41,429
The most powerful A.I. in history,
orders of magnitude more powerful

584
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,559
than the human brain?

585
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,018
Who would have that capability?

586
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:47,390
Obviously, a quantum programmer
of the highest caliber.

587
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,682
So only the best among us.

588
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:49,600
Yes.

589
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,973
PROGRAMMER:
And who might that be?

590
00:33:50,997 --> 00:33:52,936
Don't say it.
- Obviously me!

591
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,321
But I didn't corrupt the Director!

592
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,823
I was the one waving a red flag

593
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:00,111
while you three were lining up
at the yeast vats, filling your bellies!

594
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:05,290
Traveler 0027, your peers have reached
a unanimous verdict.

595
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,622
We find you guilty.

596
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:09,672
HE GROANS

597
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:11,567
What?

598
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,002
Escort her to the sentencing room.

599
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:16,210
Wait! W-W-Wait. Wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no!

600
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:19,217
No, no, no, no! MacLaren, do something!
- I'm sorry, Grace.

601
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,586
Trevor, don't let them do this!
- You can't help her, Trev!

602
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,217
But she's innocent!
- Trevor! Help me!

603
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,790
She doesn't deserve this!
- She didn't do much to help her case.

604
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,101
It's in the hands of the Director now.

605
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:56,362
Be seated.

606
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,218
Your sentencing will begin shortly.

607
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,853
What do you think will happen to her?

608
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:21,112
If the Director agrees with the Tribunal,
she'll probably be overwritten.

609
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,695
Can I give you a ride home?

610
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,704
Oh, it's not that far.

611
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,706
I think I'll walk.

612
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:29,241
I just need to clear my head.

613
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,628
You OK?
- I'm fine.

614
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,232
Marcy?

615
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,149
May I speak with you?

616
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,650
Yes, of course, Programmer.

617
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,487
You may never get an apology from 0027

618
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:09,952
but as a programmer, I want you to know how
sorry I am for what happened to you.

619
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,292
Thank you, but that's not necessary.

620
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:15,125
Well, I think it is.
What 0027 did to you was criminal.

621
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,776
That sense of emptiness that you must feel,
of not being whole...

622
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,757
It's offensive to me
that someone would do that to you

623
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,237
for their own agenda.

624
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,715
Well, I guess she'll face the consequences.

625
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,179
But you shouldn't have to.

626
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,190
I think I can offer you the missing pieces
that you've been looking for.

627
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,943
This is my field of expertise.

628
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,895
I don't understand.

629
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,908
My new team has been doing research
on preserving host memory.

630
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,612
In your case, that would be your first
iteration.

631
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,663
I thought those memories were lost forever.

632
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,245
Perhaps not all.

633
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:56,958
Perhaps even the most powerful memories,
the most defining...

634
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,918
are still there...

635
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,587
and I can get them back for you.

636
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:03,864
When?

637
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,253
Well, as soon as you like.

638
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,589
Of course, if you need time to think
about it...

639
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,383
No, there's nothing to think about.

640
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,449
Unfortunate, what must happen to Grace.

641
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,252
Is it?

642
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,161
In that it's a waste of intellect.

643
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,465
Returning to Ops now.
Bringing Marcy with me.

644
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,513
Half-hour out.

645
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,469
I'll be ready.

646
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,232
SHE SOBS

647
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:13,832
Are you here?

648
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,425
I'm here, 0027.

649
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:28,597
Call me Grace.

650
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,767
I didn't betray you.

651
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,017
I would never betray you.

652
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,773
You, of anyone, should know that.

653
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:48,401
You are one of four candidates,
although the probability of guilt

654
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:52,369
is negligible.

655
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,200
Then why are you going to overwrite me?

656
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,753
Be patient.

657
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,549
I have not yet determined who amongst you
is the traitor.

658
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,061
No...

659
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,105
No!

660
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,483
Who did this?

661
00:39:22,003 --> 00:39:23,003
I don't know.

662
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,027
Was this your team?

663
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,482
Well, the frame is powered,
it can still function.

664
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,609
I can still help you, Marcy.

665
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:34,699
We both know you're not trying to help me.

666
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,006
You won't shoot.

667
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,500
You want Ellis' backdoor code
to take over the Director

668
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,634
and you think it's still inside my head.

669
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,466
Listen to me, Marcy.
The future is at stake.

670
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,630
MAN: Drop your weapon!

671
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:02,814
What the hell happened?

672
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,309
Honestly? I don't even think that he knows.

673
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,196
The situation is now resolved.

674
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:20,912
0029 will be charged with the crime
of Treason

675
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,793
and sentenced immediately.

676
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,544
You used my trial as an excuse
to get everyone here in the 21st

677
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:32,882
to flush the traitor out?

678
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:33,931
The frame...

679
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:37,011
SHE WHEEZES
has also been neutralised.

680
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,680
You humiliated me.

681
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,858
I sacrificed everything for you.

682
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:50,146
I... I left everything I knew behind,
just to save you.

683
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,740
DIRECTOR: I'm sorry.

684
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,614
I hoped you would understand
it was necessary.

685
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,961
You're still gonna punish me, aren't you?

686
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,971
I know I took the life of this host
after the fact.

687
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,758
I know I interrupted the Grand Plan.

688
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,219
Ellis is dead because of me.

689
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,063
But I can never go back.

690
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,310
Isn't that punishment enough?

691
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,613
More than enough...

692
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,484
I owe you my life.

693
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,870
Thank you for saving me, Grace.

694
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,582
I shall miss you.

695
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,977
Traveler 0029, you have been
charged with the crime of treason.

696
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,392
You're on the wrong side of history,
MacLaren.

697
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:08,023
And you have been found guilty.

698
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,900
And the Director will sentence you now.

699
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,609
HIGH-PITCHED RINGING

700
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,034
HE GROANS

701
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,450
HE CRIES OUT IN AGONY

702
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:28,795
HE WAILS

703
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,051
SILENCE

704
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,429
Welcome to the 21st.

705
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:46,104
TREVOR: Boss?

706
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,266
Make every fragment of it unrecognisable.

707
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,278
It's over then?
- I'm not so sure.

708
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,200
Who killed all of them?
