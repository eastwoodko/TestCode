1
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,850
Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,395
Thanks for picking me up.
I know you're working.

3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,474
No problem.

4
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,316
Have you told Walt?

5
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,817
I haven't told anybody.

6
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,661
MAN: Don't. I can't. I can't.

7
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,872
I can't. No. I can't.

8
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,255
I can't.

9
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,466
HE 8083: Don't.

10
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,921
MAN CRIES OUT

11
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:55,805
Please!

12
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:57,974
You.

13
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,349
You sick fuck, we're after you.

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,020
Please.

15
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:04,603
GUN FIRES

16
00:01:12,883 --> 00:01:13,883
What?

17
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,147
Hit a snag in the basement.

18
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:16,490
Pipe leaking water.

19
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,030
Show me.

20
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,703
WATER TRICKLES

21
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,882
Get a sledge.

22
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,174
SLEDGE HAMMER CLUNKS

23
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,815
TENSE MUSIC

24
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,057
INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER POLICE RADIOS

25
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,767
BOYD: Agent Mac Laren.

26
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,018
Alive and well.

27
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:28,648
Officer Boyd.

28
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,311
I'm very glad to see your vest worked
as advertised.

29
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,146
Yeah, you didn't
have to shoot twice.

30
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,311
Sorry.
Professional instinct.

31
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,446
He's with us now.
- Ah.

32
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,484
4112. What the hell
happened in there?

33
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,152
Exactly what
happened to my team.

34
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,787
Except these four
weren't rescued.

35
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,947
I can't imagine
who'd do something like this.

36
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,043
When I last saw you, you said something
about some faction in the future

37
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,088
that exists now.

38
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,791
The faction's been around for years.

39
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,457
It started as a movement in...
- Shelter 41, I know.

40
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,000
Shelter 41 collapsed.

41
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,543
Not in the future he came from.

42
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,420
Least it was there when I left.

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,132
Guys, I think we need to keep Protocol 2
in mind here.

44
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,055
Right. Well, this couldn't be
the work of the faction anyway.

45
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:07,969
Why not?

46
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,308
You told me, when my team went missing,
that you'd seen

47
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,224
this kind of thing happening
long before I arrived in the 21st.

48
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,563
The faction didn't exist when I left.

49
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,353
I always assumed it was the Director.

50
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:20,239
There's no way the Director's capable
of what we just saw in there.

51
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,399
Isn't letting it happen just as bad?

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,076
When can my team have the scene?

53
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,489
Forensics will be another
few hours at least.

54
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,539
But after that, it's all yours.

55
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,342
Trev?

56
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,462
I don't want you to feel down
on account of this thing taking months.

57
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,891
You shouldn't feel down either, Gary.

58
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,598
I know, I know, but I can't help it.

59
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,647
I mean...

60
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,144
Kid, you used to fly!

61
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,521
If you had pressure in the pocket,
you would just put on those afterburners

62
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,780
and blow right through the defense.

63
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,363
It was a thing to watch.

64
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:09,659
Must be hard for you.

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
It is.

66
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,335
It's really hard.

67
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,455
You'll get through it.

68
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,217
I know you will.

69
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,802
Thanks, son.

70
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,014
Hey...

71
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:26,724
you too.

72
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:31,581
TREVOR: Know what?
This... This is good right here.

73
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,605
I can walk from here.

74
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,365
Thank you.

75
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:47,722
HE GROANS

76
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:48,746
You OK?

77
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,831
Yeah, I got it.

78
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:53,574
Thanks for the lift, Dad.

79
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:39,503
<i>PA: Dr Thomson, you're needed in
Radiology 2. Dr Thomson in Radiology 2.</i>

80
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,552
You're up next.

81
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,926
Excellent photography.

82
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,880
Dr Barker. How are you doing today?

83
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,428
Great. You?

84
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,841
Oh, fine, thanks.

85
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,010
Great. That's really, uh...

86
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,097
I should probably...

87
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,140
Oh. Yeah, uh...

88
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,352
Don't... Don't let me get in your way.
I was just gonna ask, uh...

89
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,116
You're busy.
Uh, I'll come by later.

90
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,822
OK. Are you sure?

91
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,782
Yeah. Yeah. I've... I've got a...

92
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,447
But I will definitely...

93
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,417
OK.
- You too.

94
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,210
I mean, uh...

95
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,587
Right this way.

96
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,270
You don't think I would've
told you if we had a mission?

97
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,280
Well, maybe another team got one.

98
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,823
It's been a long time.
- 2163 hours.

99
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,236
Not that I'm counting.

100
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,157
You really are an optimist.

101
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,870
Yeah. Yeah, I really am.

102
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,544
You can quit if you want.

103
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,758
HE EXHALES DEEPLY

104
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,346
HE STRUGGLES Come on.

105

Five.
HE GASPS AND WHEEZES

106
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:26,612
Time.

107
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,609
Alright.

108
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:31,899
We did it!

109
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,579
I just thought you might want a little bit
of human contact.

110
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:39,208
HE GROANS Oh...

111
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,500
Two minutes recovery and then we go again.

112
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,911
No problem.

113
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,292

00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,738
HE SNIFFS

124
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,736
That's the smell of death.

125
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,985
Police forensics came up with nothing.

126
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,038

142
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,560
Morning.

143
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,018
Mm. Smells delicious.

144
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,778
You never cooked this much
when we were together before.

145
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,484
You just never liked my cooking.

146
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,567
Oh, you're definitely a better cook, but...

147
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,912
it's like you're a different person now.

148
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,702
Nope. <i>Same</i> guy.

149
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,829
On the outside, maybe.

150
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,129
Yeah, and on the inside,
nougat and caramel.

151

you broke up with.

00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,257
I didn't know what I had, David.

154
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:05,868
Same guy.

155
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,259
Hey! I'm trying to give you
a compliment here, OK?

156
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,307
You're... You're more confident.

157
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,500
I used to be able to read you, but...

158
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,232
it feels like there's so much more going on
in there now.

159
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,438
It's mysterious.

160
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,821
HE SCOFFS QUIETLY

161
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,737
You don't know mysterious.

162
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,778
You know, there's an ingredient in
these eggs that's gonna blow your mind.

163
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,283
SHE GASPS IN PAIN

164
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,333
You OK?

165
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,742
Yeah, I'll be fine. It'll... It'll pass.

166
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,251
Blair, this keeps happening.

167
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,041
Let's get you in to see a doctor.

168
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,251
I'm fine. Really.

169
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,709
SHE GASPS: Ah!
- OK, that's enough. Let's go.

170
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:53,981
Hey, Carly?

171
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,434
It's hard for me to focus with you pacing
around with a gun in your hand.

172
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:00,696
CARLY: Sorry.

173
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,780
TREVOR: It's OK.

174
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,472
PHILIP: So judging by the T.E.L.L
of these four host candidates

175
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:08,656
I think I've figured
out who our group was.

176
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,202
A team of five, just like us.

177
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,322
Which leaves one member unaccounted for.

178
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,367
PHILIP: Traveler 2192.

179
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,787
Let's find them.
- TREVOR: If they're still alive.

180
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,248
I think I can narrow it down by checking
which candidates didn't die

181
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,757
the day 2192 arrived.

182
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:28,214
TREVOR: This com isn't telling me much,
other than it's been all over the place.

183
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,385
Get that com working.

184
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,063
Look, I'm sorry, but we've already
contacted all of the victims' families.

185
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,565
But Jacob went missing at the same time
as those other people.

186
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,816
I mean, isn't it possible that
there were more victims?

187
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:43,103
No, there were only four found
at that location

188
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,989
and none of them were named Jacob, ma'am.
- Beth, Beth...

189
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,695
I am sorry.
- Let me talk to her.

190
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:48,825
If you say so.

191
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,360
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

192
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,158
Come on in here. We'll talk privately.

193
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,791
Thank you.

194
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,205
Have a seat, Mrs...?

195
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,995
Ward. Sylvie.

196
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,622
You say your husband's been
missing for some time?

197
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,715
Three and a half months.

198
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,339
That... That is a long time.

199
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,380
The police haven't been able
to find anything.

200
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,153
I don't even think they're looking anymore.

201
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,641
What can you tell me about him?

202
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,261
Jacob's wonderful.

203
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,723
I mean, we had our troubles
through the years

204
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:23,611
but lately, the last year and a half
or so, our marriage has never been better.

205
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,519
What changed?

206
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:31,239
Before, he was loud, he smoked like a
fiend, he wasn't health-conscious at all.

207
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,030
But I always knew that he would come around
and he did.

208
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,168
Almost overnight,
his priorities completely realigned.

209
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,333
He became more attentive, compassionate...

210
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,591
Did you ever see him in the company of
any of the other victims?

211
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,720
He didn't run away with another woman

212
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,382
if that's what you're thinking.
- That's not what I'm thinking.

213
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,849
I'm just wondering if there's a connection.
Say, in the workplace?

214
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,980
No. Jacob didn't believe in
bringing his work home with him.

215
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,481
He said that was our time.

216
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,186
And you've had no communication
with your husband's cell phone?

217
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,856
Any activity in his bank accounts?
- No. Nothing.

218
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,367
But I believe that he is still alive,
Agent MacLaren.

219
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,037
I have to.

220
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,333
TREVOR: Didn't you just take some of that?

221
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,551
She said to take it as needed.

222
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,546
And I need to focus.

223
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:36,716
Does Marcy know what's in this?

224
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,603
It's Marcy-approved.
Let's get back to work.

225
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:45,921
You guys there?

226
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,435
<i>PHILIP: Yeah, boss, What's up?</i>

227
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,729
I got a name on our fifth traveler.
Jacob Ward.

228
00:15:50,218 --> 00:15:51,218
We're on it.

229
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,523
<i>Philip, I want you to put a
tap on his wife '3 cell phone.</i>

230
00:15:53,547 --> 00:15:54,659
<i>Sylvie Ward</i>

231
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,453
She just paid me a visit.
I'll text you the address.

232
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:58,874
Will do, boss.

233
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,335
Shit!

234
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,963
I gotta go.

235
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,767
JEFF: I'm sure Carly will be here
any minute now.

236
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,842
Her new job's...

237
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,348
been a little crazy.

238
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,225
In the meantime, how are you doing?

239
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,813
Fine.

240
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,231
JEFF CLEARS HIS THROAT

241
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,311
Lot of change in your life.
How's it going?

242
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,861
Ah, it's all good.
Just living through the changes.

243
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,489
When Carly's here,
I sometimes get the impression

244
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,740
that you're going out of your way
to agree with her.

245
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,574
Might be useful to use this time,
while we have it, to talk about you.

246
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,660
JEFF CLEARS HIS THROAT

247
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:44,021
Yeah, I can do that.

248
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,045
OK.

249
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,507
Do that.

250
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,462
How much do you know about guilt?

251
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,844
Hi! I am so sorry I'm late!

252
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,345
Hey... there she is!

255
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,145
Yes.

256
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,682
Big week for you two.

257
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,397
Your final custody assessment from CPS.

258
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,391
How are the two of you feeling?

259
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,089
Good.

260
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,979
Yeah, it's really good.
- Really good.

261
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,067
That's good.

262
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,084
Marcel

263
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,460
Hi!

264
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:27,358
I've been looking everywhere for you.

265
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,749
Uh, is everything alright?

266
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,541
Yeah.
Everything's fine.

267
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,136
No. Urn...

268
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,713
I got back together with... with Blair.

269
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,202
And, um...

270
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,183
Good for you.
- HE SCOFFS: Right.

271
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,887
I wasn't looking for you
to tell you that, but, uh...

272
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,819
I think there might be something
wrong with her.

273
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,103
Uh, well, did you take her to Admitting?

274
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,812
Yeah, see, that was the original plan

275
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,898
but then I learnt that
she didn't have insurance.

276
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:55,405
Um... But she's been having these harsh
stomach pains

277
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,329
for over a week now and I'm worried that
if she doesn't get it looked at-

278
00:17:58,353 --> 00:18:01,536
David, I... I'm just an X-ray technician.

279
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,948
I think we both know that's not true.

280
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,293
Besides, I think an X-ray's
exactly what she does need.

281
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,380
Alright. Uh...

282
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,415
Bring her to Imaging in block C.

283
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,636
Thank you.

284
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,632
You two are really gonna hit it off.

285
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,977
PHILIP: Hey, boss.
- Hey. What have you got?

286
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:35,424
You were right.

287
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,610
Our man, Jacob,
is definitely our missing Traveler.

288
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,401
He went off the grid sometime mid-May. If
he's still out there, he's good at hiding.

289

Uh...

325
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,619
The scans did show a foreign mass
in her stomach.

326
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:10,828
Oh, God, here we go.

327
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,913
I'm afraid to even guess at what that...

328
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:13,962
You don't have to.

329
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:16,715
It's cotton balls.

330
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,050
Cotton balls?

331
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,252
How could she possibly have ingested-

332
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,711
It's a weight-loss thing.

333
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,844
It's supposed to make you feel fuller.
I don't know.

334
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,612
David, I don't think that
you realise how...

335
00:20:28,636 --> 00:20:29,808
I know.

336
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,312
Not to mention unbelievably dangerous.

337
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,956
I mean, she's lucky she didn't eat enough
to cause an obstruction.

338
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,891
Yeah, that's what happened last time.

339
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,485
Alright. Uh...
SHE SIGHS

340
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,444
We'll get her stomach pumped
and she'll be on her way

341
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,233
but you cannot let her-

342
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,526
I know, I know.

343
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,788
I know.

344
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,325
I'll talk to her.

345
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,418
Um...

00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:57,172
HE SCOFFS

347
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,757
Thank you.

You're welcome.

00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,202
Agent MacLaren. Is there news?

351
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,666
Actually, I was hoping Jacob
had contacted you.

352
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,918
Contacted? I haven't heard a thing.

353
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,799
Mind if I come in?
- Is everything alright?

354
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,211
I hope so.
I just have a few more questions.

355
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,631
I just... I'm late for an appointment.
Maybe I could drop by your office later?

356
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:52,975
How did you break this?

357
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,145
I told you to leave me alone!
- Jacob! I'm here to help you!

358
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,267
JACOB: No!
- Jacob!

359
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,102
He's running! Back stairs!

360
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:09,828

THEY BOTH GRUNT

365
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,132
Stop it!
I'm Traveler 3465.

366
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,386
We're here to help you.

367
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,638
And you're making that
awfully goddamn difficult.

368
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,551
You people have no idea
what you're getting yourselves into!

369
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,445
Traveler teams from all over the world
are being abducted and tortured.

370
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,346
We know.

371
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:41,562
The Director assigned us to investigate
their disappearances

372
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,734
but they found us before we could...

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,571
It's bad.

376
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,781
Marcy, drop what you're doing.
Get back to Ops.

377
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:54,289
We got a patient.

378
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:01,585
Keep your eyes open.
We're getting you to our medic.

379
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,671
Call Sylvie.

380
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,076
You need to tell us what you know.

381
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,262
What did your team find out?
Who's behind this?

382
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,545
Whoever it is, they covered their tracks.

383
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,806
We do know that the buildings...

384
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:18,846
Every one Travelers were taken to
all... all around the world...

00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,398
What about the buildings?

387
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,525
They're owned by numbered companies.

388
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:25,939
Sh... Sh... Shells...

389

00:25:07,984 --> 00:25:08,984
Funny.

407
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,808
Hey, before I drop by tonight,
you want me to stop at the grocery store

00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:13,634

Yes! Some kind of smoked meat.

Meat...?

413
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,218
<i>I need the iron!</i>

00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,727

is Vincent Ingram.

423
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,448
He's got an estate
about a half-hour from downtown.

424
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,737
I let one of his people know
that you're on your way.

425
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,033
OK, great. Thanks, Beth.
Text me the address.

Just did.

00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:54,927
Nope.

430
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:56,888
I just got here.

431
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:59,692
You were the last person who had them
yesterday when we were working.

432
00:25:59,716 --> 00:26:02,424
I didn't take your drops, Philip. Relax.

433
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,176
What's that supposed to mean?

434
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,220
Uh... look around.

435
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,099
Just give them back.

436
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,694
What's going on, man?
- I know you're trying to monitor me.

437
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,150
I can take care of myself.

438
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,152
So just back off

439
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,158

Hey, Marce... y.

Uh, I just wanted to say thanks again
for your help with Blair.

Uh, I really appreciate it,
and she's doing better, so...

Um...

Anyway, I was hoping you could, uh...

00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,196
you could join me...

me and Blair, for dinner tonight
as a way to say thank you.

Uh, so if you're free,
that would be great...

456
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:09,836
to see you.

457
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,502
I know I just saw you,
but it would be...

458
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,496
it'd be great to see you again.

459
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,509
I do, like, a fish dish now.

460
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:20,513
Uh, branzini.

461
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,764
I know you like white fish
and all those Omega 33.

462
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,474
No cotton balls, I promise.

463
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,678
Anyway, uh...

464
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,940
All this to say, I hope you can join me.

466
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,486
I mean, because Blair will be there, too.

467
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:39,147

468
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,908

00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,370
But we've grown up a lot.

472
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,660
And Carly's an amazing woman

473
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:55,671
and I'm thankful every day
that she's a part of my life.

00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,592
How's your landscaping job going?

475
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,387
Still great.

476
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:04,692
I see that neither of you
have missed a session with your counsellor.

477
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:05,831
How have they been going?

478
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,884
Very helpful.

Well, I was...

00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:18,988
angry.

482
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,696
And hurt.

483
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,199
But, by talking things through,
we found out that we were both angry.

484
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,624
We just didn't have as much to be mad about
as we thought we did.

485
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,415
The counselling has helped me forgive Jeff.

486
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:39,920
And to not let the past stop me
from seeing who he is now.

00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,931
I have to admit, you're doing very well
at keeping up the act.

489
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,680
Oh, please.

490
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,733
I've been doing this along time.
You can't fool me.

491
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:57,902
Jacqueline...

492
00:28:57,945 --> 00:29:00,027
But it's not necessarily a bad thing.

493
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,437
It means you want to try.

494
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,324
Most marriages include at least a
little bit of faking it, trust me.

495
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,972
I can see how much this means
to the both of you

496
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,612
and how committed you are.

497
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:14,208
You may not ever
be great spouses, but...

498
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,252
I think you could be good parents.

499
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,895
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

500
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,941
My office called.

501
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,037
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

502
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,655
I apologise for the conditions of entry
into my house.

503
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,365
Please, don't take it personally.

504
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,904
That's alright, Mr Ingram.

505
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,073
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

506
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,413
Have we ever met, Agent MacLaren?

507
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,214
Well, I usually remember the people
who decline to shake my hand.

508
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,072
How do you close your business deals?

509
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:46,962
Through a legal representative.

510
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,173
And a large transfer of money.

511
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,630
I'm investigating the four bodies

512
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,483
that were found in the basement
of the building at 46 Henderson Avenue.

513
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,884
Why are you speaking to me?

514
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,603
One of your companies
owns the property.

515
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,685
I suppose, on paper,
that's technically true

516
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:05,319
though I think the company that leased it
from me would be better able to provide you

517
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,729
with the day-to-day operations.

518
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,022
Have you spoken to them?

519
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,533
Not yet.

520
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,408
If an employee of a Microsoft store

521
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,821
was involved in a criminal act,
even a serious one, would most

522
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,205
FBI agents think to question Bill Gates?

523
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:22,500
The four victims were tortured extensively
and over an extended period of time

524
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,506
so I hope you won't take it personally
if I'm being thorough.

525
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:29,168
Well, I don't know how much use I can be.

526
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,838
I've never seen the building
or stepped foot inside

527
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,177
and I operate all my business remotely.

528
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,008
I never leave this house.

529
00:31:36,413 --> 00:31:37,413
Never?

530
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,099
My therapist encourages me to be blunt.

531
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:45,101
I'm agoraphobic, germophobic
and I don't like personal contact.

532
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,481
Well, I'm very sorry
that I have to be here.

533
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,531
You don't.

534
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,903
You're naturally curious about
the wealthy recluse

535
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,738
and your badge gets you in my door.

536
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:54,822
That is blunt.

537
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,954
Please, ask your question
and get this over with.

538
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,378
You founded one of the leading
digital security firms.

539
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:09,634
I am curious why you're so strict
about outside electronics in your home?

540
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:14,297
Well, despite the best precautions,
Agent MacLaren, privacy is an illusion.

541
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:19,056
With cameras and microphones
built into every personal device...

542
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,433
My therapist says I'm paranoid

543
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,691
but I think it's human nature
for us to do anything

544
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,067
to protect ourselves and our families.

545
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:29,572
TAYLOR: Dad?

546
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,696
I'm just finishing up a meeting.

547
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,231
Go... Put your coat on.

548
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,196
I'll be out there shortly.

549
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,582
HE SIGHS

550
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,327
I try to reserve a couple of hours
every day to play with my son.

551
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,790
Do you have children?

552
00:32:46,692 --> 00:32:47,692
No.

553
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,424
Well, I'm sure there's still time
for you and your wife.

554
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:56,265
I remember now!

555
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,969
We met five years ago at a charity event.

556
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,146
It was before my condition
became so debilitating.

557
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,681
You were there with your wife...

558
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:07,568
Kathryn.

559
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,607
Sorry... Didn't recognise you.

560
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,521
A stunning woman, if I remember it.

561
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,945
This dark hair,
and a wonderful dance partner.

562
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,656
In your shoes,
I would never have let a single soul

563
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,911
steal a dance from her.

564
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,789
Please send her my regards.

565
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,957
That is, if our business is concluded.

566
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:29,715
It is.

567
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,341
For now. Thanks for your time.

568
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,471
Happy hunting.

569
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,506
MACLAREN: The event would've been
five years ago.

570
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,643
Liberty Banquet Hall.

571
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,849
Looks fancy.

572
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:47,939
I have no idea, but I'd
be on the guest list.

573
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:50,560
"MacLaren plus guest."

574
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,447
That's you.

575
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:55,658
Yeah.

576
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,691
OK. Look for Vincent Ingram.

577
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,416
There's no sign he was there.

578
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,667
Doesn't mean he wasn't.

579
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,248
Can you hack into his private server?

580
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:11,298
You know it.

581
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,166
How you doing? What's that? What's that?

582
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,219
CORK POPS

583
00:34:16,114 --> 00:34:17,114
Jeff!

584
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,048
We did it.

585
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:19,964
We deserve to celebrate. You...

586
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,809
deserve...

587
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:23,746
to celebrate.

588
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,181
You made a promise.

589
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:29,481
A couple hours ago, we didn't know
if we were ever gonna see our son again.

590
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,521
Come on, I'm just trying to say thank you.

591
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,535
JEFF LAUGHS

592
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,410
Hey, big boy!

593
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,334
Come here. Come here.

594
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,461
HE LAUGHS

595
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:53,484
I missed you.

596
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:54,508
JEFFREY CRIES

597
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,800
PHILIP: Redundancy number six?

598
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,765
That's just excessive.

599
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,675
Just try again.

600
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,128
TREVOR: The Director didn't order us
to investigate this guy.

601
00:35:07,152 --> 00:35:08,933
We're breaking Protocol 5 by doing this.

602
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,394
As far as I'm concerned,
this falls under Protocol 1.

603
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,524
The mission comes first.

604
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,733
The whole grand plan's in jeopardy
if we can't stop teams from being taken!

605
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,944
Now, maybe this guy didn't pull the trigger
but if he's involved in any way-

606
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,191
PHILIP: He froze me out.

607
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,948
That's redundancy number seven.

608
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,579
I thought you said you could do this!

609
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,036
There's a reason why he's the best
in the 21st.

610
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,746
Shouldn't you be the best,
considering the century you come from?

611
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,838
Hey, look.

612
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,379
Yelling at it worked.

613
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,061
Oh, my God.

614
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,438
KNOCKING ON DOOR

615
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,406
Wow.

616
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,327
You look...

617
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,410
I can't even finish my sentence.

618
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,488
That seems to be going around.

619
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,826
Hi.
- Hi.

620
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,669
Uh, Blair just texted
and she's running a little late

621
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:20,129
but the fish is ready, so if you want
to eat, we could eat.

622
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,418
Uh, let's wait.

623
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,838
Yeah, you know, we probably should.

624
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:26,723
Um... I wasn't, uh...

625
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,851
I wasn't sure if
you were actually gonna come.

626
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,887
Well, you invited me.

627
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,103
How's your therapy been going?

628
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,855
No more panic attacks.

629
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,904
HE CHUCKLES

630
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,777
I still find it hard to fall asleep
when I'm in bed with Blair, but...

631
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,931
You know, I didn't mean it like that.

632
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,282
You know, like we don't - we do,
but just, you know...

633
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,369
you know, not excessively,
just a normal frequency.

634
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:52,418
Not like...

635
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,993
What was I talking about?

636
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,411
How you can't sleep.

637
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,374
Right!

638
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,539
Uh, she snores.

639
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,051
Hey, would you do something for me?

640
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,354
Anything.

641
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,773
Tell me about me.

642
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,520
Like, things you don't remember, or...?

643
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,361
Okay, um...

644
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,490
HE CHUCKLES

645
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,194
I used to call you Batgirl.

646
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,244
From you running off
at all hours, fighting crime.

647
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,123
Uh...

648
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,407
You liked listening to country music.

649
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:34,877
Which country?

650
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,044
No, it's a...

651
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:38,464
It's a genre.

652
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,089
Um, you liked honey in your tea, but not-

653
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,466
No, I mean, uh, what I was like.

654
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,131
Oh. OK.

655
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,180
Um...

656
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,013
Stubborn.
HE CHUCKLES

657
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,558
You drove me crazy sometimes,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

658
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,062
Uh... fierce.

659
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,685
Little yell-y, now and then.

660
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,145
Generally... amazing.

661
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,240
I'm not really sure that's what I'm asking.

662
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,285
Um...

663
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,819
I'm just trying to find the missing pieces.

664
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,955
All I can tell you is what you did to me.

665
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:17,211
How I felt...

666
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,044
whenever you would walk
through the door...

667
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:23,842
Every time.

668
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:26,960
Like butterflies, you know?

669
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,926
That feeling in your stomach.

670
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,759
Even more so when you would go out again.

671
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,727
Someone like you...

672
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,564
does not happen to someone like me.

673
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,072
And I know that doesn't
answer your question

674
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:51,155
and I know that you're just trying to
remember the missing pieces, but...

675
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,374
maybe someone is best defined
by how they affect the people around them.

676
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,747
I think I just made that up,
but I think it may be true.

677
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:08,929
DOOR OPENS

678
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:10,848
Hey, guys.

679
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,427
Um, I'm so sorry I'm late.

680
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,182
That's okay. We were just, uh...

681
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,848
GRANT: <i>Marcy, Carly...</i>

682
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,603
<i>I need you back at Ops, right now.</i>

683
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:22,270
Um, actually I have to go,
something just came up.

684
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,230
Oh. No, really?

685
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:25,898
You don't need to...

686
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:26,812
I do.

687
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,321
Um, thank you for the wine.

688
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,909
Bye.

689
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,043
PHILIP: There's a file for each of us.

690
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,045
CARLY: I can't believe we found him.

691
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,260
Open mine.

692
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,651
We take him tonight.

693
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,783
Before another Traveler dies.

694
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:15,865
You're fucking right we do.

695
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,081
Let's gear up.

696
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,662
OK, we go in quiet and fast.

697
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:25,795
Kill him and we get out.

698
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,330
Boss, I don't agree with this.

699
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,215
Yeah? Well, we're gonna need you.

700
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,341
How about you, Philip?

701
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,220
Oh, I'm in.

702
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,468
Alright, there are four
armed guards outside.

703
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,428
Here, here, here, and here.

704
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:38,967
I don't know how many staff inside.

705
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:39,885
CARLY: Alright.

706
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,646
Let's park behind this tree line
and proceed on foot.

707
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,238
TAYLOR: And, after lunch,
Miss Henry let me read

708
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:46,687
<i>From The Chrysalids“.</i>

709
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,852
She said I had a very
impressive vocabulary.

710
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:49,940
Go get it!

711
00:40:50,175 --> 00:40:51,175
Good for you.

712
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,236
Come on. Come on, boy.

713
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,822
DOG BARKS

714
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,089
DOORS CLANG SHUT

715
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,346
BANGING ON THE DOOR

716
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,895
VINCENT: Taylor?
- Good boy. Come on.

717
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,940
Taylor!

718
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,853
Not so far. Not so far!

719
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,902
Come on.

720
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,978
ROBOTIC: Traveler 001.

721
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:37,238
ROBOTIC: Traveler 3468,
you are off-mission.

722
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,823
Stop your pursuit of Traveler 3468

723
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,113
and his team immediately.
- Stand down immediately

724
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,656
or face repercussions.

725
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:44,828
ROBOTIC WHIZZING

726
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,917
CHILDLIKE: Where's my mum?

727
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,295
ROBOTIC WHIZZING

728
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,166
Dad? What's wrong?

729
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:53,487
Come back inside.

730
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,001
Quickly. Quickly!

731
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:56,716
It's alright, sweetheart.

732
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,547
I'm a policeman.

733
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,803
Boss?
- PHILIP: What do we do?

734
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:08,686
Taylor and I are leaving tonight.

735
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,775
We won't be returning.

736
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,739
Stand down.

737
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,449
What?

738
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,315
The Director must have a reason.

739
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,359
The Director's the one
who wanted him found!

740
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:20,902
We found him! Let's finish it!

741
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,411
It's not our mission.

742
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,374
Not tonight.

743
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:28,623
Come on, sweetheart. Let's get you home.

744
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:34,968
Come on.

745
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,592
Do you know your address?
