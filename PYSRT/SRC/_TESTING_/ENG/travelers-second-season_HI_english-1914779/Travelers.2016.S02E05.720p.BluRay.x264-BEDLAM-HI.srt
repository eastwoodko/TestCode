Philip? Is that all of it?

00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,337
Is it error-free?

00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,090
Yes.

00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,723
Is it good?

00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,428
It's great. Can you move?

Little girl named Chloe.
I said I would send it to you.

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,771
Yeah, well, something like this,
I have to see for myself.

What did we do last night?

20
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,307
We were going to your place.

21
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,937
We did.

22
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,862
We did?
HE CHUCKLES

This is disturbing.

24
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,327
You hit the drops pretty hard.

25
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,491
Mm...

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,582
It's never felt like this before.

27
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,038
It'll pass.

28
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,670
We need to talk.

29
00:02:13,027 --> 00:02:14,027
This has to end.

30
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,086
What?

31
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,885
This. Us.

32
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,224
What?

33
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,224
I got a new mission.

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,055
What mission?

35
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,678
Sorry, Philip.

36
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,138
Lightning struck.

37
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,065
So "goodbye"?

38
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,652
We never see each other again?

39
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,027
I... I thought we had a connection.

40
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,484
Right.
I am your connection.

41
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,194
That's not what I meant.

42
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,740
That should last you a few months

43
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,517
if you use 'em the way
you're supposed to.

OK.
- A hundred point six.

49
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,779
It's high, but manageable.

50
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,536
I know, I know, I know, I know.

51
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,833
So, um...

52
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,920
alternate between these two:
acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

53
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,416
It should manage his fever
or whatever pain he might be in.

54
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,250
CARLY: That's it?
- That's it.

00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,851
He should be fine in a few days.

You hear that, baby?

57
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,008
Auntie Marcy says you're gonna be alright.

58
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,263
Ah.

59
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,931
Stay for coffee?

60
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,141
Sure.

61
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,267
OK.

62
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,807

Philip.

65
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,013
You've been quiet lately.

66
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,598
Yeah, not much to say.

67
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:37,020
Well, some people find talking about it
to be therapeutic.

68
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,275
It has been two weeks.

69
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,483
You know that doesn't make
a difference for me, right?

70
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,444
I remember every detail
as if it just happened.

71
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,701

76
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,504
We were given orders to meet you.

00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,705
You must be Graham.

78
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,461
Yeah. Come on in.

79
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,837
You boys hungry? I got soup on.

80
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,591
No, thank you.
- TREVOR: Smells delicious.

81
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:11,433
You have a lovely home.

82
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,930
It's just temporary.

83
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,978
Driving up and down the state,
making hand-offs.

84
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,065
PHILIP:
Along mission.

85
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,066
Well, roll out's been longer than expected

86
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:20,768
but I ain't complaining.

87
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,561
I got to see three eagles!

88
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,563
Hopefully you're done soon.

89
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,073
Yeah, well, your team's
one of the last on the list.

90
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,450
SUDDEN VIOLENT COUGHING

91
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,323
Excuse me.

92
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,409
Here you go.

93
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,628
TREVOR: What a lovely couple.

94
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,760
Thank you for coming
and checking him out.

95
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,467
I know I probably sounded crazy.

96
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,017
No, you don't sound crazy.

97
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,682
You had a natural maternal instinct.

98

CARLY LAUGHS

99
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,980
I don't know about natural.
It's not like I'm really his mother.

100
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,522
Yeah, you are.

101
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:06,280
In every way that means something.

102
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,524
You guys have bonded.

103
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,369
Who would've thought
that would happen to somebody like me?

104
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,824
MARCY:
You mean a soldier?

105
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,207
Maybe you've changed.

106
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,370
Maybe we all have.

107
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,169
I mean, I have to believe that

108
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,710
we are more than
just our consciousness.

109
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,091
At least, the one we came here with.

110
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,131
Maybe that's...

111
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,550
Maybe that's the better part of us.

112
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,381
It's funny, you said something like that

113
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,265
the night that you...

114
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,180
Um...

115
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,766
What?

116
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,607
The night that I was reset?

117
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,737
What did I say?

118
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,692
Mac didn't tell you?

119
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,194
Well, he said that it was the only way to
save my life.

120
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,821
It was.

121
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,406
Well?

122
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,413
I really didn't have any choice then.

123
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,375
You thought you did.

124
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,998
What? What does that mean?

125
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,547
I shouldn't have said anything.
- No, Carly.

126
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,222
We just didn't know
it was gonna happen so fast.

127
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,843
Are you saying that it happened
against my will?

128
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,015
I don't know.

129
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,102
We thought you had more time.

130
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:24,770
So did you.

131
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,152
You said you wanted to go home

132
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,511
because you wanted to think about it.

133
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,279
What could there possibly
be to think about?

134
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,735
I mean, I'd be dead.

135
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,243
I know, that's what I said at the time.

136
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,537
Now I'm beginning to understand.

137
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,676
This is exactly how it happened last time.

138
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:58,430
Kat... you've been taking your medication

139
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,056
you've done everything by the book.

140
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,308
It's gonna be alright.
- Oh, stop saying that.

DOOR OPENS

142
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,524
Hi. Apologies.
The, uh, the printer was down.

143
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,859
How are we?

144
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,366
Kathryn, the, uh, latest ultrasound

145
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,242
it looks good.

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,741
It looks really good.
The dark Spot's completely gone

147
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:26,920
which means that it was probably nothing
or maybe just a mistake with the scan.

148
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,581
You and the baby are fine.

149
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,631
I'm sorry...

150
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,008
Thank you.
- DOCTOR: You're welcome.

151
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:44,810
Now, I want you to stick to the
calcium-rich foods, the folic acid, and...

152
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,731
OK
- I'll see you in a few weeks.

153
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,312
WHISPERING: OK.
- Thanks.

154
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:49,938
OK.

155
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,900
Thank you.

DOOR OPENS

160
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,000
What was in the package?
- An antiviral.

161
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,757
Historically, this is the beginning
of a minor flu outbreak

162
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,714
that kills 70,000 people worldwide.

163
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,264
That does not sound "minor" to me.

164
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,951
Percentage-wise. we're not wired
to think in "billions" of people.

165
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,387
Over a few months, an antigenic shift

166
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,768
allows the virus to mutate

167
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,178
infecting more of the population.

168
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,272
Eventually, the CDC and WHO get it
under control.

169
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,112
Must be why they provided
a broad-spectrum antiviral.

170
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,567
This will inhibit
the development of each of its mutations.

171

Our mission is to save three of the people
who, historically, don't make it.

Are there any more?

173
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,256
Jeffrey's already been through
the worst of it.

174
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,770
You need to protect yourself.

175
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,502
Couldn't we have gotten
the pill version?

176
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,796
These are the host candidates?

177

179
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:59,179
Personal trainer, a flight attendant
and a travel blogger.

180
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,317
Prime hosts that must
have spread the virus.

181
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,592
Well, let's make sure that doesn't happen.

We need to talk.

215
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,163
Hello, Miss Day.

216
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,898
When's the last time you heard
from the Director?

217
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,442
LAUGHING: The school board director?
- What are you talking about?

218
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,706
Hey, you're worried about them?

219
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,509
Please! There's literally nothing going on
inside their tiny brains.

220
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,715
The girls are thinking about
their insipid friendships

221
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,259
and the boys are imagining them naked.

What do you want?

223
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,460
SPEAKING VERY SLOWLY:
Have you heard

224
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:33,726
from the Director?

225
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,224
Yeah, we've had missions.

226
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,591
Well, why haven't I heard anything?

227
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,693
I don't know. Maybe because
you jumped here without permission?

228
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,520
Or maybe because you don't have a team?

229
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,861
Maybe I can join your team.
I could be your computer expert.

230
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,511
Nah, we already have a computer expert.

231
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,576
I could be your vastly-more-capable
computer expert.

Not all.
SHE SIGHS

404
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,518
You, Philip, and Carly have it.

405
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,055
You and I somehow rejected the virus.

406
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,310
What?

407
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,607
Each of your blood samples

408
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,812
has a viral load between 500
and 1,000 copies per millilitre.

409
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,105
Ours is zero.
- What about antibodies?

410
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,448
Trace amounts.
- Somehow, we're immune.

411
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,616
How is that possible?

412
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,944
It's hard to say, without
running more tests.

413
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,534
So, if we're immune, can't you create
a blood serum?

414
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,036
We'll try, but we might be
running out of time.

415
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,695
If this started with the mission,
we can't be the only ones.

416
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:03,603
Check the deep web for any other teams
reporting the same symptoms.

417
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,374
If it's transmitted
through air particles and fomites

418
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,207
that means there's a good chance

419
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:10,518
you've infected everyone
you've come into contact with.

420
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:11,799
Are you sure?

421
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,507
Outside of an immunity

422
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,601
we're predicting an infection rate
of over 40%.

423
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:17,722
PHILIP:
Forty?

424
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,740
Call everyone you've
come into contact with.

425
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,226
Tell them to stay inside.

426
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,549
Boss, you're gonna want to see this.

427
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,081
Traveler teams from around the world
are reporting the same sickness.

428
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,108
MARCY: They've been transmitting it
this whole time.

429
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,948
If I get you more of the antiviral,
can you analyse it?

430
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,157
See what went wrong?

431
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,656
Possibly, but I'm running low
on ethidium bromide.

432
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,082
It's a controlled substance

433
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,439
it's not something you can get
on short notice.

434
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,463
What about your hospital?

435
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,833
Yeah, the lab should have some.

436
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,585
I'll text you a name.

437
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:50,176
You two, track down the team
that handed off the vials

438
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,464
I'll go to the hospital.

- Hey, it's Marcy. We need you back at Ops.</i>

643
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,415
We know the source of the antiviral.

<i>A Traveler named Jenny.

I'm on my way.

646
00:34:27,856 --> 00:34:30,336
FORBES: Mac, it's been over an hour.
- What are you doing here?

647
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,320
We're late. We gotta meet
with the National Guard.

648
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:33,630
You'll have to do it without me.

649
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,065
We need you.

650

Jenny?

HE COUGHS

656
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,636
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

657
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,347
No, no. Jenny. Hey, hey.

658
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,139
Hey! Hey.

659
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,852
No. No, no. No. No.

Do I have any other choice?

663
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,534
SHE COUGHS
- Alright.

Shit.

Shh... It's OK, I've got you.

675

I got you. It's OK.

Shh-shh-shh. It's OK.

678
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,412
It's OK. It's OK.

679
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,683
DAVID:
You know, when I was a kid

680
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,603
my mum would make me chicken soup
when I was sick.

681
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,479
Not exactly sure why
it was always chicken soup.

682
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,104
Vera!

683
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,190
Hey, I was trying to reach you.

684
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,357
I said no doctors!

685
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,689
OK. No, no.
- Don't touch me.

686
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,273
No. It's David. See?

687
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,322
SHE LAUGHS
- Hi!

688
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,903
You OK?
- Yeah.

689
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,638
Alright. You got something to eat?
- Yeah.

690
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:33,869
Ok. I'll be around
if you need me. OK?

691
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,798
It's OK, big man.

692
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,583
We're gonna get through this.

693
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:46,254
CHILD CRIES
- We're gonna be fine.

694
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,173
You're a fighter.
Just like <i>Mama.</i>

695
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,553
Just like Daddy.

696
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,599
CRYING CONTINUES
- It's OK, it's OK.

697
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,972
It's OK. It's OK.

698
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:08,612
Hey.

699
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,699
I sense that doctor you sent me to
likes you a lot.

700
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,156
Where's... what's-her-name, Jenny?

701
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,617
They should be back any minute.
- Philip knows her how?

702
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,496
Ah, oh... So what's this?

703
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:24,170
I'm trying to determine
the pathogen's reproduction number

704
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,752
based on hospital databases, social media
updates...

705
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,508
Here. Let me show you something.

706
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,141
An "r-nought" indicates

707
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:38,393
how infectious a virus is

708
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:40,599
by determining the rate of secondary
infection.

709
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,900
If it's less than one

710
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,186
the virus will quickly die out.

711
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,071
If it's greater than one...

712
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,778
We have an epidemic.

713
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,156
So what are we dealing with?

714
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,460
Let's put it into perspective...

715
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,118
Influenza has an r-nought of one...

716
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,668
With an incubation period of two days.

717
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,121
Chances are you'd infect
one person in a day

718
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:04,377
then they'd go on to infect
one more, and so on.

719
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:08,590
This virus has an r-nought of at least two

720
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,135
with an incubation period...
of 10 days.

721
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,221
Fourteen days ago

722
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,975
ten Traveler teams across the world
transmitted the virus.

723
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,643
So that is...

724
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,566
Potentially, 150
people on day one...

725
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:33,318
Three hundred and thirty...

726
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,372
on day two.
- I don't like where this is going.

727
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,585
So, based on the data I pulled
from people already reporting symptoms

728
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,000
and factoring in
the exponential growth rate...

729
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,636
Over 4 million people

730
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,679
are currently infected.

731
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,340
Tomorrow, it'll be almost 10.

732
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:58,094
Most of them aren't showing symptoms yet,
but they will soon.

733
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,266
So how long before the death rate
starts to climb?

734
00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:01,600
A couple of days.

735
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,689
PHILIP:
I need some help out here!

736
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:07,944
Clear off that table.

737
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,906
Marcy, I don't know if she's breathing.
She took pills.

738
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:17,912
Get her up here.

739
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:22,322
TRAVELER D-13:
I got a weak pulse!

740
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,745
What'd she take?
- Oxycodone.

741
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,548
JENNY GASPS
- PHILIP: Hey, hey

742
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,922
Jenny, I'm here. I'm here.

743
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,173
You're at Ops. You're safe.

744
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,665
JENNY COUGHS
- PHILIP: You're safe.

745
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,889
You overdosed. I found you in your room.

746
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,261
Hey! Listen to me.

747
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,387
Listen to me.

748
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,343
The mission is in trouble.

749
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,724
No, Philip.

750
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,023
The mission went exactly as planned.

751
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,896
MACLAREN:
What?

752
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,987
What do you know?
- It won't change anything.

753
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,610
What did you make me do?

754
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,441
JENNY PANTS

755
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,865
My team...

756
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:01,039
they tried to record messengers...

757
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,369
JENNY GROANS

758
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:06,754
but any incoming signal
caused static on our devices.

759
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:09,085
We needed a historian.

760
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,968
And someone to synthesise the catalyst.

761
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,757
No.

762
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,382
I was directed to create an antiviral.

763
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,433
Actually, you were...

764
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,855
directed to expedite genetic
recombination of the historical pathogen.

765
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,514
You created the new virus.

766
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,683
No, no, no. She's delirious.

767
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,564
The Director would never
order that mission.

768
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,146
Who said the mission
came from the Director?

769
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,067
The future I left

770
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:38,447
was divided

771
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,163
between those loyal to the Director
and the Faction.

772
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,745
Both sides fighting for control

773
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,159
back and forth.

774
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:53,546
When you reset the Director,
we lost the ability to access the 21st.

775
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,552
We lost the past, we lost everything.

776
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:58,092
We had no choice
but to shut down the reactor.

777
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:01,308
We've had missions.
Received messengers.

778
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,761
And that's all. Only messengers.

779
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,268
Without the Director's processing power

780
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,645
consciousness transfer isn't possible.

781
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,354
So...

782
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,608
before power was cut to the Director

783
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:19,447
in our last moment of control,
we sent everyone we could to the 21st.

784
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,782
All at once.

785
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,788
Into the quantum frame?

786
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,160
How many?

787
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,788
The frame is capable
of receiving and storing thousands.

788
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,541
So Forbes,
all those people with the FBI...

789
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,708
Are all Faction.

790
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,958
Every mission we've done since...
- Has been for them.

791
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,218
JENNY:
The Faction has our own plan.

792
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:40,843
Overpopulation is the single greatest
threat to the 21st century.

793
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:45,097
The Director wasn't capable
of seeing the natural solution.

794
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,271
How many people are gonna die?

795
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,858
The virus is genetically engineered
to preserve 70% of the population.

796
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:54,227
The future will survive.

797
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,395
SHE COUGHS

798
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,818
And those of us who die,
including me

799
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,699
will have made a great sacrifice.

800
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,324
Seventy percent? Jenny,
you're murdering over 2 billion people.

801
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,072
The mission comes first.

802
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,454
FORBES: <i>Take positions
around the device and stand by.</i>

803
