1
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,313
First time?

00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,528
PHILIP:
Yeah. You?

3
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,025
Second.

4
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,741
Third for him.

5
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:46,292
JERVIS:
Good evening, Historians.

6
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,249
Welcome to Regional Update 4.

7
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,539
I'm Traveler A-26
of the archivist program.

8
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,759
If this is your first time,
please take a moment

9
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,462
to look inside the bag
you were provided on the way in.

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,804
The two green pills are to be taken
immediately following the update.

11
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:07,064
It's important that we restore
any chemical imbalances in the brain.

12
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,855
The yellow pills, you will need
going forward.

13
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,400
From time to time you may
perceive what we call

14
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,358
"projections" -
visual manifestations

15
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:22,121
of one or more alternate timelines -
an unavoidable side-effect

16
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,497
of memory not acquired
by conventional means.

17
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,291
The yellow pills will help to focus your
sensory perception

18
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,247
on one timeline at a time.

19
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,709
When you run out, call this number
to arrange for more.

20
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,505
Get that?

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,132
Yeah.

22
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,388
JERVIS:
Next, Protocol 2H.

23
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:46,183
The update is not to be discussed
with anyone. Ever.

24
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,184
Do not break this protocol.

25
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,393
This update will include historical
information relevant to your team's role

26
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,355
in the Grand Plan, including potential
candidates, investments, etc.

27
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:01,870
But by its very nature, your update may
also include historical information

28
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,575
about your team members,
loved ones

29
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,951
about you.

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,123
This is a burden you will have to
carry with you until the day you die

31
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,040
a date which, for obvious reasons,
will be omitted from your update.

32
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,380
Any questions?

33
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,467
Let's begin.

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,385
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
<i>Historians.</i>

35
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,930
<i>Open memory chain 1A.</i>

36
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,638
Hey. I made breakfast.

37
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,390
Uh, I don't wanna be late.

38
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,055
Hey, come on, Carly.

39
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,141
Take five minutes.

40
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,105
KATHRYN:
Grant! They chose me!

41
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,856
Who?

42
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,562
The Pattersons.

43
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,526
Uh...

44
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,237
You know, the restaurant owners.

45
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,694
Jill.
- Jill. Right.

46
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,784
This means what exactly?

47
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,622
That I will be designing their new
restaurant with a brand-new baby.

48
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,627
Well, you'll have my help with the baby.

49
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,671
I can't take a job
that I don't have time to do.

50
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,627
Kat! We'll figure it out.

51
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,171
So I should say yes?
- Do you want to say yes?

52
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:23,422
Yes.
- Then yes.

53
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,549
OK.

54
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,548
I'll let them know.

55
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,018
Soon.

56
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,349
Nice work.

57
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,485
Hey, guys.

58
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,534
Hey.

59
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:47,780
What's the mission?

60
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,413
I got a messenger
with lotto numbers yesterday.

61
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,660
Director must've seen we're in a bit of a
financial hole and decided to step up.

62
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:56,754
Good.

63
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,496
I obviously can't win any more lotteries

64
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,539
without attracting undo attention,
so...

65
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,376
you won 86k on the super draw
last night...

66
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:08,089
and these numbers on the mega ball for
tonight will get you 62.

67
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,474
Sixty-two dollars
doesn't sound like very much.

68
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,261
$62,000.

69
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,225
Oh, OK.

70
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,015
You both get six numbers out of seven.

71
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,560
Why don't we just win seven out of seven
and we're covered?

72
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,297
Because historically, someone else is
supposed to win the big one

73
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,243
and completely ruin their lives.
- What about me?

74
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,361
You are too young to gamble.

75
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,034
An excellent example of irony.

76
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,862
MARCY SNIGGERS

77
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,409
So will that get us out of the hole?

78
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,623
PHILIP:
Not even close.

79
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,954
This is seed money.

80
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,077
But I can quadruple it
with horse races and use

81
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,629
those earnings to create
something far more substantial.

82
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:44,337
How does that even work if the historical
record has changed?

83
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,921
The messenger gave me very detailed
instructions.

84
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,383
We're good.

85
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,764
Congratulations, you guys!

86
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,758

What did you think?

90
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,174
I liked it. It's like therapy.

91
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,513
Yeah. That's the idea.

92
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,478
We should do it more often.
- I'm in.

93
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,606
Hey, do you know if there's a store
around here anywhere?

94
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,980
So do I go for the $3 water,
the luxurious $5 bottle of water...

95
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,775
or the suspiciously under-priced
99 cent water?

96
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,904
You're buying a lottery ticket?

97
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,076
Mm-hmm.

98
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,706
Thanks.
- You know...

99
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:03,162
I buy one once in a while when the jackpot
gets insanely big like this one.

100
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:08,046
I don't know why. I mean, any size jackpot
would change my life.

101
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,586
I always play my same lucky numbers.

102
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,759
Yeah. Do you ever win?

103
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,218
Nope.

104
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,519
Thank you.

I need to invest that.

Well, turns out "baby needs a new pair of

Uh... If things were OK at home?

Oh, thank God.

You have formed

make sure it doesn't get any worse.

we can talk about our options

that core engaged, right?

324
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,735
You know what I mean?
Get that heart rate up.

SHE LAUGHS

You know what I mean?
- SHE LAUGHS

327
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:49,075
Unh... Come on, Carly.
You know that body likes to dance.

328
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,664
I don't even know what you're doing.
- Come on, Carly, it'll come to you.

329
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:56,713
Let it go.

330
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,714
That's right.

331
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:05,847
OK!

332
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,719

Hey.

335
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,493
What did you find?

336
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,564
I took a look at her file. There's nothing
out of the ordinary.

337
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,623
She's stable.

338
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,195
Her blood pressure's a little high-—
- Those drugs you gave me

339
00:21:40,219 --> 00:21:41,960
shouldn't they have
protected her from this?

340
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,298
They were designed to help

341
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,921
not to make her invulnerable.

342
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,216
HE SIGHS
How do we get you in there?

343
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,465
I don't think you understand.
There's nothing even I could do.

344
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,637
She's right where she needs to be

345
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,206
and if they need to take the baby
out early, a Caesarean section

346
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,723
is a standard procedure
for these doctors.

347
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,603
Medicine isn't magic, in any time.

348
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,906
Would you like me to inform
the team of what's going on?

349
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,200
No.

350
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,404
No, I'll do it when the time is right.

And, uh, yeah

352
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:23,089
it just feels good to know
I'm not doing that to my family anymore.

353

Thank you, Mike.

Did you want to share?

00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,517
Uh, yeah, I do.

357
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,687
Hi. My name is Philip
and I'm an addict.

358
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,522
ALL: Hi, Philip.

359
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:44,652
I have a secret.

360
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,283
I know the future.

361
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,702
I know what's going to happen.

362
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,991
Global events.

363
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,743
Deaths.

364
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,783
Winners of horse races.

365
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,375
It was all recently delivered to me
like a movie.

366
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,544
And mostly, it's the same future
that I remember

367
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:12,425
but there are differences.

368
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,470
You all think I'm crazy right now...

369
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,522
but it's true.

370
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,069
For example...

371
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:32,071
I know that somebody in this room has very
recently been diagnosed with cancer

372
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:33,401
and has decided to ignore it.

373
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,203
As if ignoring the problem is going to
make it go away.

374
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:45,797
Because there's only a 50/50 chance
that the treatment will work.

375
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,929
And they're afraid of going through
the pain of chemotherapy for nothing.

376
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,633
And the truth is, I don't know...

377
00:23:58,187 --> 00:24:02,021
whether this person is going to live
or die if they decide to get treatment.

378
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,021
I only know for certain that without it...

379
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:08,652

I'm sorry, what... what was I saying?

382
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,992
Not much.

383
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,952
You stopped talking after you said,
"I have a secret."

384
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,375
Oh.

385
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,416
I'm sorry. Um...

386
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:33,170
Maybe someone else should go.

TREVOR:
I recently learned that my host

457
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,036
was abused before I got here by him.

458
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,209
I had no idea.

Neither did I.

460
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,132
I promised my friend, Kyle,
that I would help take him down

461
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,304
and just now...
- Kyle was a host candidate.

462
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,632
You knew?
- 3:09, this afternoon.

Driving drunk. I'm sorry.

00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,101
but as far as I'm concerned,
that coach killed him.

Mr. MacLaren, in this case, it was

antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome, or APS.

470
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,580
She developed an arterial thrombus

471
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:21,502
which then caused a coronary embolism,
which is a clot in the heart.

472
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,129
Kathryn went into cardiac arrest.

473
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,585
Mr MacLaren, in our efforts to save
Kathryn's life...

474
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,300
We lost the baby.
- Yes.

475
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,473
And all I can say is that it's...

476
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:37,601
extremely fortunate that
that clot passed on its own

477
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,646
or this would be an even more difficult
conversation for both of us to have.

478
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,480
When can I see her?

479
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,735
She's in recovery, she's sedated,
but you can see her in a few hours.

- Philip, tell me where Hall is.

482
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,411
PHILIP <i>ON</i> COM: <i>Boss, he 's here.</i>

483
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,661
What?

484
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,240
TREVOR: Hey, boss.
- PHILIP: Easy...

485
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,082
Get off of me!
- CARLY: Listen!

486
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,821
PHILIP: We can't do that.
- MACLAREN: You're a fucking

487
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:11,256
dead man!
- I know, I know...

488
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,212
You killed my child!
- Not what happened.

489
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,108
You'd better hope
the Director overwrites you

490
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:17,464
before I get... HALL: The
Director was the one who sent me!

491
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,681
I was on a mission.

492
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,020
HALL:
Let him go.

493
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,226
Let him go.

494
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,687
HALL:
There you go.

495
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,687
What're you talking about?

496
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,736
The child was never going to survive.

497
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,821
It was never supposed to.
- You don't know that.

498
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,619
My mission was to save your wife.

499
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,993
There had to be a way to save them both.

500
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,370
MARCY:
I don't think there was.

501
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,252
HALL:
Listen to your medic, MacLaren.

502
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:48,789
What did you do?

503
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,835
Kathryn MacLaren was going to die
of an undiagnosed coronary embolism

504
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:56,012
that stopped her heart during the
delivery of her stillborn child.

505
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:59,486
HALL: The Director ordered me
to give her a traveler-synthesised drug

506
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,095
to eliminate the clot
so that she would survive

507
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,930
because she wasn't supposed to die

508
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,854
because you broke Protocol Four.

509
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,573
She wanted a child more than anything.

510
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,780
HE SCOFFS
You're gonna stand there and uh...

511
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,206
and blame her for this?
Is that what you're doing?

512
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,204
No.

513
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,921
Right.

514
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,457
Look, I get it.

515
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,708
HALL: I get it. It's tough
to stay focused in the 21st.

516
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,441
That's what I've been trying to tell
you guys ever since I met you.

517
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:38,218
Trying to teach you guys
to not get caught up in all the bullshit.

518
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,967
HALL:
But you had to stab me in the back, huh?

519
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:48,057
The Director obviously agreed with me
or you wouldn't have gone to prison.

520
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,774
Yeah...

521
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,397
I can't argue with that.

522
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,084
HALL: I guess we all need a lesson
now and then of what our mission is.

523
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,320
And this was yours.

524
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,866
But, hey.

525
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,369
MacLaren, your wife is still alive.

526
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,207
Go be with her.

527
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,687
Welcome home.

528
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,818
Hey. Yeah. Sorry.

529
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,114
Hi.
- CHILD GURGLES

530
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,741
I know it's later than I said.

531
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,286
Can I hold him?

532
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,453
I was trying to get him to go to sleep.
- I know. I don't care.

533
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,866
CARLY:
Hey.

534
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,202
JEFFREY: You wanna cuddle
with your mama, big man?

535
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,005
So...

536
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,842
How was today for Carly Shannon?

537
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,012
It's over now, let's leave it at that.

538
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,423
You?
I had a pay duty.

539
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:06,143
I basically just chaperoned some drunk
college kids around for time and a half.

540
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:09,021
Sounds awful.
- Wasn't so bad.

541
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:10,726
You OK?

542
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,726
Tell me about the day he was born.

543
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,020
Ah...

544
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,356
Are you sure you wanna
go there right now?

545
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,575
Cos that's not your favourite story.

546
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,071
I want to hear it from your perspective.

547
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,245
JEFFREY SNIGGER

548
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:48,806
KATHRYN:
Grant?

549
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,391
HE WHISPERS:
I'm here.

550
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,895
They told me she was a girl.

551
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,658
SHE SOBS

552
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,680
Holden.

553
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,520
Change your mind?

554
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,979
You're going to come clean.

555
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,230
Sorry?

556
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,820
You're going to come forward
to the police

557
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,114
and you're going to detail all
that you've done.

558
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,239
Trevor, what are you talking about?

559
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,070
Do it on your own volition

560
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,697
and face the consequences
or it'll be done for you.

561
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,584
Yeah?
- TREVOR: Mm-hmm.

562
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,753
I'm not gonna do that.

563
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,040
Those are your only two options, so...

564
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,135
I don't think you realise what
you're doing, here.

565
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,890
You're really willing to throw everything
away to destroy both of our lives?

566
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:10,183
TREVOR: There's other lives to consider.
- Oh, come on.

567
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,056
Maybe you don't want
to play football anymore

568
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,847
but you do not want
the shit storm that'll come from this.

569
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,273
You prey on young boys
who look up to you.

570
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:22,776
You make promises in exchange
for access to their bodies.

571
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:26,074
Come on, Trev.

572
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,826
I will come forward.

573
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,412
I'll talk about the
hotel rooms on the road.

574
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,167
The showers.

575
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:37,873
All of it.

576
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,830
Who's gonna believe you?

577
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,587
You're a bad kid
and everybody knows it.

578
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:43,922
People change.

579

COACH PERRY:
Not the Trevor Holden I know...

580
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:50,637
I don't know where this act came from,
but I don't buy it for a second.

581
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:52,767
I know you.

582
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:54,474
Intimately.

583
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,140
You're going to keep your mouth shut.

584
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,314
I'm not threatened by you.
- You should be.

585
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,981
Don't push me, kid.

586
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:20,962
Release the materials.

587
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,932
PHILIP ON COM: On it.
- Release the materials?

588
00:38:22,956 --> 00:38:24,538
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

589
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,639

Did you get your winnings?

Amazing luck.
- Isn't it!

609

You're not upset that I cheated?

I don't understand.

618
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,976
I didn't feel right taking what would
have been yours

619
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,863
if I hadn't peeked at your numbers,
and I know

620
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:04,471
that you wouldn't let me give it back,
so I gave it all away.

621
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:08,437
I helped out a lot of good people.
Honestly, Marcy, it was...

622
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,572
It was the best day of my life.

623
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:14,155
Remember my... my client, Jason

624
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,953
with the bad teeth and the hair?

625
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,448
Yeah. I do.
- Yeah. Great teeth now.

626
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:20,991
I mean, they will be.

627
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,083
Even getting them cleaned has made
a huge difference.

628
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,497
And on Wednesday, he's got some
much-needed dental work.

629
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,336
Good for Jason.

630
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,293
Yeah! No, he hates dentists.

631
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,090
Who else?

632
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,547
I'm not sure if you remember Marjorie.

633
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,590
I bought her a new walker.

634
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,351
They're pricey for what they are.

635
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:43,184
Uh... Steve got one of those scooters
to get to his new job.

636
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,769
He can't walk very far without breaking
into a sweat.

637
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,401
Jordan got my bike for his
pizza delivery job.

638
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,482
Your bike?
- Yeah.

639
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,606
Yeah, I thought I'd buy myself a new one.

640
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,488
I should have saved some.

641
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,531
All of it?

642
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,702
I know it sounded like a lot of money, but,
I mean, everything is just so expensive

643
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:05,252
and I had a whole list of people.

644
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,080
David...
- It doesn't matter.

645
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,665
I'll get my steps in.

646
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,469
So...

647
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,507
What're you gonna do with yours?

648
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,717
Um...

649
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,798
I have some debts to pay off.

650
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,383
Debts!

651
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,389
Wow, that is responsible.

652
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,017
SHE CHUCKLES
I should have some left over.

653
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,140
Even more responsible!

654
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,897
So what're you gonna do with it?

655
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,103
Well, first...

656
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,439
I'm going to buy you a new bike.

657
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,446
I'm so happy you said that.

658
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,112
THEY LAUGH

659
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,882
What's happening right now?
Where the hell is this kid?

660
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,214
Give him a minute.

661
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,637
He's probably hungover.

662
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,889
I'm sorry, he's what?

663
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,353
Sorry, I'm late.

664
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:08,265
I was having a hard time deciding
what clothing to bring with me.

665
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,979
Yeah, not a problem, kid.
Just don't make it a habit.

666
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:14,646
So, what's the mission?

667
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:18,404

acquired by conventional means...</i>
