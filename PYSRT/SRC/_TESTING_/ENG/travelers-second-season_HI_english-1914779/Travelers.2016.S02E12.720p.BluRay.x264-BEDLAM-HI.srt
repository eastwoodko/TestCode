1
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,162
Seven months ago

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,715
my consciousness was sent
from the distant future

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,213
into the body of Special
Agent Grant MacLaren

4
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:16,218
moments before he would, historically,
have died in the line of duty.

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,768
Since then, I have assumed his life,
his work...

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,727
his marriage...

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,811
pretending to be a man
very different than myself.

8
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,612
In truth, I am Traveler 3468.

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,905
One of thousands of Travelers
around the world

10
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:37,451
who have come from a time
when life is all but wiped out...

11
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:42,156
To save humanity, to change the path.

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:48,337
I know how that must sound,
especially to you, Kat...

13
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:51,753
but it's true.

14
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,994
PHONE VIBRATES

15
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,432
Good afternoon, Agent MacLaren.

16
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,689
Where is she?
- Perrow? She's safe.

17
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,272
Though her neck might be a little tender

18
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,858
after having to remove the com
she allowed you to plant.

19
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,238
Let her go, Ingram.
- Of course.

20
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,865
Soon as we put this to an end.

21
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,821
I'd like to propose a truce.

22
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:51,544
You kidnapped and tortured my team,
killed Travelers all over the world.

23
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,624
I needed to know if the Director was still
after me, and that suspicion was confirmed.

24
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:59,335
My mission was to die
immediately after my arrival.

25
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,171
By surviving, I committed a crime
against the Grand Plan

26
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,505
and was condemned to death.

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,886
Is that fair?

28
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,933
Not up to me.
- No.

29
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:14,567
No, it's up to the Director, who has
no understanding, no forgiveness, no soul.

30
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,566
Because it is a machine.

31
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,067
I am tired of running.

32
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,525
Take a selfie, you can end it right now.
- For me, the digital age

33
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,611
has created a prison around me,
one that's been...

34
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,242
shrinking over time.

35
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,949
It's no way for my son to grow up.

36
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,375
Are you trying to get sympathy from me?

37
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,921
No. No, I want your word
that you'll leave me alone

38
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,045
while I prepare my affairs
and face my accuser.

39
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,456
That's not going to go well for you.
- I have no illusions.

40
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,383
I know exactly what's going to happen.

41
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,591
I stole 16 years that I wouldn't otherwise
have had

42
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:50,178
and in that time,
I created a precious life.

43
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:54,724
My son shouldn't have to pay
for the mistakes of his father.

44
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,646
Do I have your word?

45
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,440
You don't have my anything.

46
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,360
That's not actually true.

47
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,957

MACLAREN GRUNTS

49
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,961
If you fucking hurt her...
- 3468.

50
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:24,337
If you want to see your wife again,
follow this simple instruction...

51
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,671
Stay out of my way.

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,580
He showed me a video.
She's being held somewhere.

53
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,203

- </i> I don't know, I couldn't tell.

54
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,097
Boss, he's faked things like this before.
Are you sure it was Kathryn?

55
00:04:57,121 --> 00:04:58,999
<i>Yes, and her phone
goes straight to voicemail.</i>

56
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,380
What does he want?
<i>- A truce.</i>

57
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,377
Fuck that.

58
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,506
He said he's going to show himself
to the Director and face punishment

59
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,592
But he wants us all to stand down
so he can make arrangements for his son.

60
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,881
Kat's his insurance.

61
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,764
He spent all this time hiding and torturing
Travelers, only to turn himself in?

62
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,017
I don't <i>buy it either.
- Right now I just want Kat to be safe.</i>

63
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,394
<i>Philip, can you trace her phone 's GPS?
- </i> I <i>can</i> try.

64
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,022
<i>I don 't think he can monitor our coms,
but let's be careful.</i>

65
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,484
If he finds out we're looking for her...
- What about Perrow?

66
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,220
<i>He claims she 's still alive, but you
should all check on your loved ones</i>

67
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,405
<i>and make sure they're OK.</i>

You really want to mount an inter-agency

You're wasting time.
- Mac, think this through.

He has them captive.
- And he warned you things could get worse.

The man said he was going
to give himself up to the Director.

Let's just wait this out...

Why would he go to the trouble of...
- He's psychotic!

He's spent years hunting Traveler teams,
mine included.

They'd be dead

Which is one of the reasons

A few weeks ago, I saw a report.

DOD, Homeland Security, CIA, the NSA...

115
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,152
It wasn't just my host task force
that was suspicious.

116
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,984
We've been discovered
across all the intelligence services.

117
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,286

Cells in over 100 countries.

121
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,878
They haven't acted
because they're scared as shit.

122
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,542
Our people at the NSA and Homeland Security
are concealing us as best they can

123
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,880
but at this point, it's only a matter
of time before there are leaks.

124

he is surrounded by love.

You're welcome.

157
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:13,998
Shit.

158
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,044
That's Grace's phone.

159
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,877
WHITE NOISE BLARES

160
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,637
TREVOR INHALES

161
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,398
Simon...

162
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,692
You said it wouldn't take long.

163
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,191
Yeah, but that's before
the interface overheated.

164
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,070
And yeah, I knew you were there,
you didn't sneak up on me.

165
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:50,431
There isn't much time.

166
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:51,455
TOOLS CLATTER

167
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,530
I know. I have a clock in my head.

168
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,705
I need more coolant. Did you bring it?

169
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,246
Everything you need is in this room.

170
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,041
Remember, we're doing this for you.

171
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,719
You said "multiple uses".
Multiple transfers.

172
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,639
Yes, and then we'll take care of you.

173
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,776
David?

174
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:22,903
David.

175
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,948
Sorry, I'm just...

176
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,322
Never been kidnapped before.

177
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,953
I've been held hostage, but that's a whole...
- Please, just...

178
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,081
Answer the question.
- Uh, yeah.

179
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,539
I am... Was, her social worker.

180
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,250
How do you know about Marcy?

181
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,548
Where is she?

182
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,803
She's safe.

183
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:56,806
As in... Safely captured, or safe at home?

184
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,804
They didn't take her.
- "They"?

185
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,231
The same people who took my daughter.

186
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,901
HE STAMMERS
I... That's terrible, I'm...

187
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,313
Then they're after me?

188
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,483
What did I do?
- David, please...

189
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,990
Just answer the questions
if you want us both to get out of here.

190
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,283
OK.
- Is it true that one day

191
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,790
Marcy's cognitive abilities changed,
and for all intents and purposes

192
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,917
she was an entirely different person?

193
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,717
Yeah.

194
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,051
Didn't that seem odd to you?

195
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,847
Of course it did. I thought
a miracle had happened, are you kidding me?

196
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,182
How did you justify that change?

197
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,219
HE STAMMERS

198
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,848
I'm pretty sure
I shouldn't be talking about this.

199
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,767
You have doctor-client privilege with me.

200
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,318
You're not my doctor.
- David...

201
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,521
She's a doctor.
- Marcy Warton?

202
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,276
With the FBI, undercover.

203
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,732
She goes on secret missions...

204
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,036
I've said too much.
- And you believed her?

205
00:15:57,123 --> 00:16:01,082
Yeah, I met her boss. Grant MacLaren.
He's real. I've been to his office.

206
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,369
God, he's gonna kill me.
I cracked in like five seconds.

207
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:07,415
David... Marcy Warton is not an FBI agent.

208
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,676
She's a Traveler... from the future.

209
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,797
A who?
- A time traveler.

210
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,652
That is the stupidest thing I've ever...
- She was supposed to be killed

211
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,815
by a group of men
outside the library where she worked.

212
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:27,813
Seconds before her death...

213
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,943
<i>a</i> consciousness was sent from
the future, supplanting Marcy's own.

214
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,567
And that new Traveler survived the attack.

215
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:41,539
And just a few months ago,
that consciousness was replaced yet again.

216
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,668
She called it memory loss,
but in fact, she was...

217
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,750
Overwritten.

218
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,636
Lady...

219
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,678
What the fuck have you been smoking?

220
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,683
HE LAUGHS

221
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,415
Hi.

222
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,326
Sorta glad I'm not alone here.

223
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,666
I'm David.

224
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,804
Kathryn.

225
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,347
Kathryn...

226
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:40,684
Are they alright?

227
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,177
Still on whatever drug they gave me.

228
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,185
You don't know any of them, do you?

229
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,485
Uh... OK, wow. Yes.
- You do?

230
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,812
Ray?

231
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,315
Ray, wake up!

232
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,901
He got me out of a legal jam recently.

233
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,705
It was weird...

234
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,953
Flay! Flay! Wake up...
- I already tried yelling.

235
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,213
Oh, for God's sakes.
- What?

236
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,665
I know him too.

237
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,298
He's a cop.
He interviewed me once about Marcy.

238
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:18,719
Who's Marcy?

239
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,425
Apparently a time traveler from the future.

240
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,931
She said my husband was, too.

241
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,180
Dr Perrow?
- Yeah.

242
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,311
But you don't actually believe...?
- Of course not.

243
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,516
Of course not.

244
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,021
Oh, Shit...

245
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,279
It's alright, you're not alone.

246
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,107
Where's my son?
Where's Jeffrey? He's just a baby...

247
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,568
Oh, he's not with us, I'm sorry.

248
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,746
You're MacLaren's wife.
- Agent MacLaren?

249
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,868
You know who I am?

250
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,519
Yeah, I <i>came</i> to your house and told you

251
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,825
that your husband
was screwing around with my girl, Carly.

252
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:51,665
Carly?

253
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,497
What?
- Yeah, you don't remember?

254
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:56,003
No, and I think that's something
I would remember.

255
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,583
So then why would he bring us here?

256
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,669
What? Why would Grant do this?

257
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,222
She's right,
I don't think this is an FBI thing.

258
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,096
How do you know
my husband works with the FBI?

259
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:08,304
He's Marcy's boss, isn't he?
- David Mailer.

260
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,077
You're the social worker creep that was...

261
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,939
screwin' around
with the retarded girl, Marcy.

262
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:14,859
That's a hateful word.
- OK, wait, who the fuck is Marcy?

263
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:15,980
His client!

264
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,655
One minute she's mentally disabled,
the next minute

265
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,901
she's whoopin' half a dozen boys
outside the library...

266
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:22,836
Yeah, she was undercover!
- Alright!

267
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,285
Enough of this shit!

268
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,204
We talk, or we get out of here.

269
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,325
DAVID SCOFFS

270
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,292
JEFF BANGS ON THE DOOR
- Hey!

271
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:35,088
Whoever the hell you think you are,
you just kidnapped a Metro police officer!

272
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,213
That's a class-A felony, and I'm gonna
put your ass away! You hear me?

273
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,093
HE BANGS THE DOOR

274
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,171
GRACE GROANS

275
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,506
Do you have to be so loud?

276
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:52,847
Who the hell are you?

277
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,400
Hello. I'm... I'm David.

278
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,651
I'm a friend of Marcy's.

279
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,278
This is Kathryn.

280
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,902
She's married to Agent MacLaren,
who's Marcy's boss.

281
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,323
This is Ray.

282
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,027
He's still unconscious.

283
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:09,536
The unhappy man is Officer... Conniker

284
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,825
who I'm guessing is in a relationship
with Carly, who's also a friend of Marcy...

285
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:15,169
All of whom may or may not
be time travelers.

286
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,496
And you are?

287
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,546
I'm a high-school guidance counsellor.

288
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,502
Oh, OK. That makes perfect sense.

289
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:24,931
DOOR OPENS

290
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,891
Wait, no. Don't you touch me.

291
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,722
No. No. No...

292
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,933
Where are you taking me?

293
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,388
Let me go!

294
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,518
SHE SCREAMS: Let me go!

295
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,020
The lady asked you to let her go-

296
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:38,442
THUD

297
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:39,815
KATHRYN: Back off! No!

298
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,692
DOOR SLAMS

299
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,943
KATHRYN: Let me go!

300
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,321
Who's he again?

301
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,074
He's my lawyer.

302
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,048
COMPUTER BEEPS

303
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,426
Vincent's sending us something.

304
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,143
Boss!

305
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,358
KATHRYN SOBS

306
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,571
SHE EXHALES

307
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:29,073
<i>Grant, in order for me to be released
unharmed, you must confess to...</i>

308
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,450
<i>being a Traveler on video.</i>

309
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:39,792
<i>You have one hour to send it to this IP,
or they'll kill me,</i>

310
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:51,935
RAY INHALES

311
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,935
Shit, not again.

312
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:01,236
Ray?

313
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,357
RAY CHUCKLES

314
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,233
David.
- Yeah.

315
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,822
We've been kidnapped.
I know that sounds crazy, but...

316
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,161
How much do you owe Vargese?

317
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,500
Vargese, anyone?
- We're not sure why we're here.

318
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,204
Does this have anything to do
with the guy in your apartment who, uh...?

319
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,333
HE CLICKS TONGUE

320
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,507
What?
- Oh... Maybe?

321
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,594
DOOR OPENS

322
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:28,365
RAY CHUCKLES

323
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,596
What's with Mr Big and Tall here?

324
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,923
Hey, wait...

325
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:36,102
Come on, take it easy, what the f... Jesus!

326
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,979
Boss, I have to say this...

327
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,809
If we do this, it goes against everything
we trained for. I know.

328
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:46,865
I'm sorry.

329
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,569
I'm not going to let my wife die.

330
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,071
I feel the same way about David.

331
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,993
Look, listen, listen!

332
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,495
I want nothing more than to hold my son
right now, but the mission comes first.

333
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,292
If you sit down at that computer

334
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,619
with the intention of confessing,
you'll be overwritten.

335
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,234
I think I know how we can do this
and still maintain Protocol 1.

336
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,794
I got my hands on an advanced rootkit virus

337
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,880
that I can plant
in the code of the video file.

338
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:12,974
Is it traceable?

339
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,681
Four months ago, it compromised the Relicus
Maxicloud in Austria for 47 minutes

340
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,727
and they still don't know who did it.
- Do you?

341
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,929
The Faction.

342
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:23,418
I can track the video
on the back channels and find his location.

343
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:25,484
What if it spreads?
- I'll know where it goes.

344
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,211
When the time comes, we can shut it down.

345
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,776
Yeah, if the Director lets us get that far.

346
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,320
I'm still not struck by lightning.

347
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,372
Do it.

348
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,701
Ready when you are.

349
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,132
HE EXHALES

350
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,180
Seven months ago...

351
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,979
my consciousness
was sent from the distant future

352
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,273
into the body of Special Agent
Grant MacLaren.

353
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:10,782
DEVICE BEEPS

354
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,040
DEVICE POWERS UP

355
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:38,386
Cooling systems at -270 degrees.

356
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:42,311
Superconductor efficiency, 99.8%.

357
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,555
LOUD SPARKING ERUPTS

358
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,440
STEAM HISSES

359
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,731
Simon!
- It's overheating!

360
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,063
Shut it down! Simon!

361
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,329
WATER SIZZLES

362
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,531
SIMON BLOWS

363
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:07,120
It was supposed to work!
- Can you fix it?

364
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,424
I told you, the device requires...
- Simon! Can you fix it?

365
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,425
This was all for you. All for you.

366
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,342
I'm his only friend?

367
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,394
Man, that is tragic.

368
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,641
The guy travels through time,
becomes a junkie...

369
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:32,020
And his only friend is a lawyer
with a gambling addiction who uses him?

370
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:34,401
I'd like to, uh, keep us on track.

371
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,606
HE MUMBLES: OK...

372
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,836
How are things at home?

373
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,430
Where's my son?

374
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,353
Jeffrey's OK. For now.

375
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,521
What does that mean?

376
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:10,771
It means if you and I cooperate,
then you'll see your son

377
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,187
and I'll see my daughter, but that entirely
depends on you.

378
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,486
There are some things
about Carly you need to know.

379
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,787
<i>'In truth, I am Traveler 3468...</i>

380
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,913
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mac.
- We've got it under control.

381
00:26:24,937 --> 00:26:25,664
Clearly you don't.

382
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:29,494
My teammate at the NSA flagged this during
her routine scan for Traveler activity.

383
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,000
If any other agent had found...
- Yeah, well, they didn't.

384
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,004
And we've taken
extra precautions with Philip's virus.

385
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:37,214
Now, once we get to Vincent,
we can corrupt the video.

386
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:38,840
I just need time to flush him out.

387
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:41,331
The intelligence agencies
already have a target on our backs.

388
00:26:41,355 --> 00:26:43,687
Well, then, let's work together
and get ahead of it.

389
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,230
Those with my specialty are chosen
as infants in order to develop their minds

390
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,853
to specifically serve the Traveler
programme.

391
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,229
Some days I felt like an experiment.

392
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,319
Other days like a super-human.

393
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,946
Today, I'm...

394
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,577
The Director has kept watch
over my entire life...

395
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:16,507
Knowing the outcome of every decision,
crafting my path forward.

396
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,551
But here...

397
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,470
I see people every day
who still believe in free will.

398
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,021
They don't know any better.

399
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:34,735
JEFF GROANS

400
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,613
RAY HISSES

401
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,902
I've taken down bigger guys than you.

402
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,162
RAY SIGHS

403
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,363
Do any of you think
this could actually be true?

404
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,538
GRACE: What?

405
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,754
A few months ago,
I definitely noticed changes in Grant.

406
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,423
It was truly like he
was a different person.

407
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,630
What they're saying would explain...
- Oh, please.

408
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,553
Like time travel is actually possible?

409
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,676
OK, maybe you could send information

410
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,474
in the form of some coherent energy
across space-time.

411
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,222
But to calculate an exact position

412
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:12,305
would require an almost impossible level of
accuracy, not to mention

413
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,731
nearly a billion zettaflops
of processing power.

414
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,900
And then to unpack it somehow

415
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:20,730
without entropy, in a... Biological...

416
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,197
What do you do again?

417
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,994
Guidance counsellor.

418
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,669
PHONE BUZZES

419
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,927
<i>He knows you tampered
with MacLaren's recording.</i>

420
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:52,391
<i>Now each and every one of you
must record...</i>

421
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,979
<i>your own confessions,
or we will all be killed.</i>

422
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,655
<i>Marcy, / just want to go home.</i>

423
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,569
<i>'I just wanna go home..</i>

424
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,915
Alright, look, look, look, listen.

425
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,828
We know there's only one way in
and one way out, right?

426
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,914
Now, there's two of them, two of us...

427
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,373
Let's take 'em.

428
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,425
Oh, I can't wait to see this.

429
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,968
JEFF: Yeah. Yeah, OK.

430
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:26,796
Next time, we jump 'em.

431
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,005
You take the tall one.

432
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,558
Which one is the tall one?

433
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,885
DAVID GROANS

434
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,141
Oh, my God.

435
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,268
David... It's OK, I got you.

436
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:39,100
I can't see out of my right eye. Is it OK?

437
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,027
Uh... It's just swollen shut.

438
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,481
"Just."
- Try that shit with me.

439
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,485
Wait, wait, wait.

440
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,862
Don't.

441
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,200
I get it. I'm next. Let's go.

442
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,707
My purpose is to save lives...

443
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:08,387
Whether that's a teammate in jeopardy,
or someone that's part of a mission

444
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,134
ordered by the Director.

445
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:14,769
But I can't help but think
that I've put one person's life

446
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,596
in more danger than they deserve.

447
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,023
David...

448
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:25,650
You've suffered because of me, and
there's just... There's no excuse for that.

449
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:30,910
I cared enough to leave once.
I should have just stayed away.

450
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,208
STEAM HISSES

451
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,392
I've lowered the temperature in the room.

452
00:30:38,416 --> 00:30:39,618
I know it's cold.

453
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,044
It's bracing, yes.

454
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,756
Is it ready?
- Almost. It's almost done.

455
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,429
For 2,000 years, mankind believed
that God was created in his image...

456
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,427
Guiding our lives, hearing our prayers...

457
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,882
Could you hand me the screwdriver?

458
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:59,017
But when those prayers weren't answered,
we just chalked it up to His divine will.

459
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,441
But then mankind
created the power to build God.

460
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,612
A machine more powerful
than any human mind could ever be...

461
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,138
It's just, uh, on the workbench...
- The fate of our existence

462
00:31:09,162 --> 00:31:14,408
just handed to an AI with the ability
to monitor each and every shifting timeline

463
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:19,868
while we blindly obey its orders
with the belief that salvation will come.

464
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,123
It's the Phillips head...
- The problem isn't the fact

465
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,875
that we believed in God...

466
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,503
"It's that we didn't believe in ourselves."
Fine, I'll get it.

467
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,591
It's time to pull back the curtain
and take control of the present.

468
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,592
To fight for our future.

469
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,147
DEVICE POWERS UP

470
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,279
MACHINE HUMS

471
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:49,897
It's working.

472
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,072
Simon...

473
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,992
We can finally fix you.

What I'm saying is that
I can't corrupt the video files

00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,154
that are already out there.

Why isn't the Director stepping in?

00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:25,417
We must eventually find
a way to solve this.

The information he has fills in the pieces
on dozens of Traveler missions

515
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,458
the CIA could never explain.

It's only a matter of time
before they put it all together...

No, the Director will

before we could even dream
of traveling back through time.

545

And I lived in many bodies

Hi.

00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,384
Did your father explain to you that you're
going to be living with me for a while?

571
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,097
Yeah, but he didn't say why.

572
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,063
So that we can be free.
