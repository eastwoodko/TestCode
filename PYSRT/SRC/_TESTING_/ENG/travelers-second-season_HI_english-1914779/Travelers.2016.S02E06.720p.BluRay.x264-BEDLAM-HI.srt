TRAVELER D-13 COUGHS

2
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,919
Where's the quantum frame?

3
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:15,839
CARLY:
He asked you a question.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,014
SHE SCOFFS

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,096
Do it. It's what I want anyway.

6
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,645
JENNY: You've been doing
what we want for months, why stop now?

7
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,514
How many members
of the Faction are here?

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,058
It could be anybody we meet.

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,485
And there could be thousands more
in the quantum frame.

10
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,651
That's why the Director wanted
us to destroy it.

11
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,195
JENNY: The Director ordered
you to build the thing.

12
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,701
I mean, how can you people
not see the irony of that?

13
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,283
You just follow it blindly, no matter what.

14
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,156
That's the difference between us.

15
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,494
No. The Faction abducts innocent people
and overwrites them.

16
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,082
That's the difference between us.

17
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:48,542
What you do is murder.

18
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:52,133
What you do is opportunism,
like taking hosts just before they die

19
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,177
is so fucking ethical?
- Yeah. That's exactly what it is.

20
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,676
Hey, guess what?
Everybody is going to die.

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,640
Some sooner than others.

22
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,431
When we're from,
everybody in the 21st is long gone

23
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,560
and for what they did to this planet,
good riddance.

24
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,098
Here's what's gonna happen, Jenny.

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,443
We're gonna stop this pandemic,
and then we are gonna hunt down

26
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,147
every member of the Faction in the 21st.

27
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,024
The Director's shut down in the future

28
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,610
and most of your team will be dead
in less than two weeks

29
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,152
so good luck.

30
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,058
If you're done questioning her

31
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,390
I'd like to take a few tissue samples,
run some tests.

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,471
Please. Whatever you need to do.

33

TREVOR COUGHS

34
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,977
We should send out an SOS
onto the deep web

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,896
and let other Travelers know
what's going on.

36
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,527
CARLY:
They'll be monitoring our backchannels.

37
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,235
If the Faction's overwritten
every single federal agent

38
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,320
that was in that room
with the quantum frame

39
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,033
I don't have those assets to use either.

40
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,785
GRACE:
OK, this is not that complicated.

41
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:06,911
TREVOR SCOFFS

42
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,497
I'm saying
the Director can fix this.

43
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,462
We need to fix the Director.

44
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,123
The Director exists in the future.

45
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,466
And its reactor's already shut down.

46
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,922
Those are big problems, Grace.

47
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,427
The plan's already in place.

48
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,881
When it became apparent
that the Grand Plan

49
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,058
would take longer than our initial
projections, the Director sent a team

50
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,137
to refine uranium as fuel to extend its
operational life.

51
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,431
A few kilos would be enough.

52
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,228
All we have to do

53
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,895
is take the fuel to the location
where the Director will eventually be built

54
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,608
and it'll be there when the time comes.

55
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:38,944
Without the Faction knowing.

56
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,570
How the hell are we gonna do that?

57
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,449
Whoa! They outsmarted us!
Whoop-dee-doo! Get over it!

58
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,325
They can't outsmart the Director.

59
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,244
Even if we can just get it back online
for a few seconds

60
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,497
that's all the time it'll need
to take back control.

61
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,586
And you know where this uranium is?

62
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,163
Pull up a map.

Ever think you'd hear yourself
complain about the heat?

What're you doing here?

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,680
to provide backup at this location.

77
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,894
You can lower your gun.

78
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,482
Backup for what?

79
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,405
Damn, I was kind of hoping
you could tell me.

80
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,656
I'm sorry, guys.

81

Squeaky little kid took me by surprise
when she first started talking.

00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,199
I missed the whole first part.

83
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,612
Yeah, messengers are weird.

84
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,202
Yeah, she said something about
uranium, maybe?

85
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,658
Yeah, you heard right.

86
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,001
We're refining it.

87
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,411
Fuel for the Director.

88
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,672
FORBE: So how the hell
do you guys get it to the future?

89
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,000
We don't.
- MARK: Yeah, we make it here in the 21st

90
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,323
then we put it away for the Director
to find it in a few hundred years.

91
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,147
Yeah, we're right on schedule,
so I don't know what we need backup for.

00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,171
Yeah?

Yeah, no, no, I understand.

I was on a mission, just like you.

132
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:18,094
We want the same thing.
We just go about it a different way.

133
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,478
We forget about...

134
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,691
the protocols and the Director, and all
those limitations, and we just...

135
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,523
do what needs to be done,
what's right.

136
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,405
Like Galloway and Aleksander.

137
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,651
That's very different than murdering
almost a third of the population.

138
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,861
To save everyone else.

139
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,612
Not a bargain I can make.

140
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,705
Well, it's done.

141
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,666

You should.

144
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,373
Your people won't be able to stop this

145
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,174
and there's nothing an historian can do.

146
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,254
Just think about the time you've got left.

147
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,631
Let's get out of here.

148
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,429
When I found you,
you had swallowed a bottle of pills.

149
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,354
Why?

150
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,814
Guilt?

151
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,265
I feel no guilt at all.

152
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,231
This is for the greater good,
and I can't believe you don't see that!

153
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,066
Then why the pills?

154
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,945
Because I was trying to end it
before the virus ran its course.

155
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,658
You feel sick now?

156
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,160
It's only gonna get worse.

157
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,822
This virus is designed
to keep the infected alive

158
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,578
as long as possible, to help the spread

159
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,710
and make the authorities think
that it's not as serious as it really is.

160
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,210
So when people start to really die,
it's too late.

161
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,212
And the last days of it
are not something I want to go through.

162
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,643
Well, now you're gonna suffer...

163
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:46,772

164
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:49,025

00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,042

I think that's the idea.

168

OK.

173
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,943
3468, on a Protocol Alpha mission.

<i>CARLY:
We need to pull up the delivery.</i>

177
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:41,956
<i>Kit's urgent..</i>

00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,535
No.

180
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,121
The reactor won't need more fuel
for hundreds of years.

181
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,081
It's the here and now we're worried about.

182
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,572
This “flu” that's going around
is about to become a pandemic.

183
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:54,258
And what's that got to do with us?
- Let's talk inside, shall we?

184
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:05,306
<i>All we have is in the lab down the hall.</i>

185
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:09,147
But I still don't see what refined uranium
has to do with a pandemic.

These guys are all Faction.

189
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:19,571
Well, I wish I could tell you the whole
plan, but, you know... Protocol Two.

190
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,948
No. I don't know.

191
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,616
I'm gonna need more.

192
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,448
Like what? Something in writing?

193
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:28,162
The Director isn't good enough for you?

194
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:29,973
You could be pretending
to be somebody else.

195
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,536
I am pretending to be somebody else.

196
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,389
It's in the job description.
Are you new here?

197
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,501
No.

198
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,043
I just don't want to see uranium
fall into the wrong hands.

199
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,172
Well, neither do we.

200
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,265

Long gone. Have a look for yourself.

00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,989
Trev.

206
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,452
Any of your team showing any symptoms yet?

207
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,246
You look like you're in the early stages.

208
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:13,037
Where did you take it?
- Even if I told you, the others would know

209
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,875
and they'd just move it to a safe place.

210
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,846
Some of them are on their way here now.
You're more than welcome to wait.

211
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,752
No sign of uranium in the lab.

212
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:26,727
Shit!

213
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,894
Feel better?
- No.

214
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,517
I do.
- Come on.

DAVID:
Soup's safe, Bob.

218
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,698
I promise.
- How'd you know my name?

219
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,447
Why does no-one ever recognise me
with this thing on?

220
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,658
It's me.
- David?

221
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,664
You shouldn't be here.
- Well, where else would I be?

222
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,995
All my friends are here.

223
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,080
BOB COUGHS

224
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,505
Soup's delicious. I tested it myself.

225
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,010
It'll make you strong and fight that bug
going around.

226

BOB COUGHS

TRAVELER D-13 COUGHS

00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,613
TRAVELER D-13: I've got to get back
to my team.

229
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,753
I've done about all I can for Boyd
at this point.

230
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,648
I wanted to give you these.

231
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,900
They're not programmed
to affect the viral load

232
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,487
but if she starts to go into organ failure,
they might buy you some time.

233
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,235
Thank you.
- Aren't nanites by directive only?

234
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,290
Well, with the Director down,
I figure the discretion falls on me.

235
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,542
Boyd's a good medic.
We could use her.

236
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,585
We'll do what we can.

237
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:36,957
TRAVELER D-13: Good luck.

238
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,004
I'd be willing to trade information
in exchange for those nanites.

239
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,714
I thought you wanted to die.

240
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,009
Not if the cure's right in front of me.
I'm not stupid.

241
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,928
You're the control. You get nothing.

DOOR OPENS

243
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,347
Well?
- There was no uranium.

244
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,637
Just the Faction...

245
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,146
waiting for us.

246
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,099
Why are you looking at me like that?

247
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:01,645
You're the one that sent us there.
- Aw, that is so insulting.

248
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,396
Yes, I did!

249
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:06,316
Because we absolutely need it
and time is short.

250
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,530
You need to find out where it is
and go get it.

251
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,162
They're a step ahead of us, at least.
We need another option.

252
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,614
There aren't any other options!

253
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,450
We need to get the Director back online.

254
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,002
The Faction has been planning
this for along time.

255
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,707
So we gotta think outside the box.

256
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,422
There's a military base just north of here.

257
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,586
NS Wallace.

258
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,209
You're thinking nuclear weapons?

259
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,261
That's nowhere near the box, Philip.

260
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,052
But that's ideal, from a fuel perspective.

261
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,593
A few hundred years is nothing
compared to the half-life of plutonium.

262
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,011
It would be difficult.
- Closer to impossible!

263
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,768
And if we've thought about it,
then the Faction probably has too.

264
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,146
Well...

265
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,611
Doesn't sound like we
have much of a choice.

266
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,079
I got you some groceries so you won't have
to go out for the next few days.

267
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,657
The store was a madhouse.

268
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,500
I heard there's looting going on.

269
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,415
Yeah, a few assholes.

270
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,663
How're you feeling?

271
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,085
I'm OK.

272
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,382
Hot. Headache.

273
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,045
Temperature's up near 100.

274
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,671
Let's cool you down.

TV BLARES

276
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,306
The news said this was an epidemic.

277
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,811
Is it really that bad?

278
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,187
Hopefully that's <i>a...</i>

279
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,640
bit of an overreaction.

They're not sure yet.

282
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,821
They're working on it. But you...

283
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,445

Grant?

290
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,047
I don't know.

291
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,375
OK, what do we do?

292
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,298
The safest place for you is right here.

293
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,804
“Safest”? OK, now you're starting
to scare me.

294
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,638
Maybe we should go to the hospital.
- Not where you want to be right now.

295
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,348
Look...

296
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,724
The next couple days,
it's gonna be hard for me to get home.

297
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,687
Couple of days?
- I will try to-

298
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,811
What about you? You're gonna be exposed.

299
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,026
I've got to support the people
who are trying to solve this.

300
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,900
And you've got to take your meds and rest

301
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:13,868
and give your body...

302
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,662
and that baby
the fuel that they need.

303
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,913
OK? That means fresh
fruit, not salted meat.

304
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,000
Do you have to go so soon?

305
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,961
The sooner I go,
the sooner I come back.

306
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,892
I love you.

307
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,146
So?

308
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,735
Took all night, but they're done.

309
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,862
Good work.
How's everybody holding up?

310
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,697
We can nap in the car.

311
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,609
When I left, you were afraid
the device wouldn't have enough range.

312
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,618
Yeah, we fixed that.

313
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,279
How does it know when to activate?

314
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:00,707
Well, the Director is programmed
to broadcast an emergency signal

315
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,117
if it's ever powered down.

316
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,919
Which should trigger the device
and activate it.

317
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,041
“Should”?

318
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,986
Do you want me to go over a list of things
that could go wrong with this plan?

319
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,125
No, thank you.

320
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,301
It'll work, boss.
- CARLY: We're good to go.

00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,379
Alright, then let's gear up.

00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,387
How is she?

324
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,263
Uh...
SHE SIGHS

325
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,187
Her viral load's holding steady
but she's not getting any better.

326
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,315
The nanites will help, right?

327
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,394
Could help.

328
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,101
Could make things worse.

329
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,527
The Faction planned this well.

330
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,154
It's hard to know what contingencies
they've thought of.

331
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,658
Use Grace as you see fit,
but keep your eye on her.

332
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,658
And... Take care.

333
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,201
You too.

00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,349
You're a hypocrite.

00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,649
You're all high and mighty
about sacrificing lives to save the future

355
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,022
and then treat me like a lab rat.

356
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,320
You did this to yourself.

JENNY COUGHS

358
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,654
This is a waste of resources.

359
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,405
I should be programming the nanites.

360
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,286
Not yet.
- Why not?

361
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,873
Because I want to see
if the anti-serum will work first.

362
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,782
I'm close.

Well, she's my patient.

365
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,373
We both know, in the time we come from,
medical nanites more or less replace you.

366
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,965
OK, if you want to be helpful

367
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:17,091
why don't you use your computer
and hack into the CDC

368
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:19,065
and find out what kind of progress
they've made?

369
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:20,089
The who?

370
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,973
Hack into them too, if you'd like.

371
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,884
Like either the Center For Disease Control

372
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,802
or the World Health Organization
is gonna know

373
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,846
how to deal with a virus designed
in the future?

Well, you're not doing a very good job.

00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,074
I feel awful.

380
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,159
Where are you going?

381
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,325
To the bathroom.

SHE COUGHS

383
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,081
Hi. We're, uh-—

384
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,084
Oh. Sorry. Uh...

385
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,010
What's he doing?

386
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:47,308
Just his job.

387
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,601
Everybody relax.

388
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,388
All these guys could be Faction.

389
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,727
If it goes down,
I'll take the booth guard.

390
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,941
Easy! We're not gonna get our warhead

391
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,652
if we start shooting people.

392
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,328
We're trapped in here,
and there's cameras everywhere.

393
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,872
Everybody, calm the fuck down.

394
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,963
Base is under quarantine, sir.
- I'm aware of that.

395
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,133
I'm Special Agent
Grant MacLaren from the FBI.

396
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,554
I've got a meeting with Captain Garcia
on urgent business.

397
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,477
All appointments have been cancelled...
- Vice Admiral Donahue

398
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:35,106
arranged the meeting, so I assure you,
the meeting has not been cancelled.

399
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,565
Check again.

I see it here now, sir.

402
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,414
Great. And the gate?

403
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,251
Just waiting for your passes to print, sir.

405
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:09,511
On your right.

406
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,436
Appreciate it.

What?

00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,040
You alright?
- GRACE: No, I'm dying

411
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,334
but I still need to go to the bathroom
periodically.

412
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:41,793
WATER RUNS

413
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,963
Well, you've been in there for a while.
I was just concerned.

414
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,971
I'm fine!

415
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:53,514
TOILET FLUSHES

416
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,326
Did you see where she put the nanites?

417
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:21,371
In there.

418
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,295
JENNY COUGHS

419
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,278
What're you doing?
- Shh.

420
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,985
Shhhh...

421
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,925
Captain Garcia?

422
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,181
Special Agent MacLaven from the FBI.

423
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,885
It's “MacLaren.”
- Your pass says “MacLaven”.

424
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,429
GARCIA: Agent MacLaren
knows his name, Ms. Jackson.

425
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,596
Should I issue a new pass?

426
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,107
He won't be here that long. You can go.

427
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,730
That doesn't sound promising.

428
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,690
It is what it is.

429
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,648
I'm sure the Admiral relayed
the urgency of our request.

430
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,320
And your pass says MacLaven.

431
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,153
People make mistakes.
- MACLAREN: Our request isn't one of them.

432
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,493
How does that particular warhead

433
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,408
possibly help prevent a pandemic?

434
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,335
I'm not authorised to explain.

435
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,083
Shame. I'd pay good money to hear it.

436
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,294
CARLY: While you're deciding
whether to help us or not

437
00:23:47,318 --> 00:23:49,685
a deadly virus is spreading worldwide.

438
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,969
You're being a little melodramatic,
aren't you?

439
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:55,097
Flu kills people every year.
- It's far worse than what's been reported.

440
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:57,068
There are millions of
people infected already

441
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,976
even if they haven't
presented symptoms yet.

442
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,477
And it's spreading exponentially.

443
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,560
The admiral's email said
you'd be coming in with CDC personnel.

444
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,895
Is that supposed to be you?

445
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,358
They're specialists.

446
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,647
Uh-huh.

447
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,734
This is making less and less sense
the more I hear.

448
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,067
If you'd like to call the Admiral,
I'm sure... GARCIA: Not necessary.

449
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,985
My orders were clear.

450
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:19,952
The warhead is being separated
from the torpedo as we speak

451
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,041
for what good that could possibly do.

452
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,535
It's being loaded directly
into your vehicle.

453
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,623
I just don't like ordnance leaving my base
without an explanation.

454
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,634
Trust me when I say
you're helping to save millions of lives.

455
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,881
I hope I'm one of them.

456
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,137
I feel like shit and so do half the people
on my base.

457
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,807
I will personally make sure
that the people of this base

458
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,343
are among the first to receive
the antidote once it's ready.

COUGHING

460
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,591
David.

461
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:12,552
You should go home.

462
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,510
Yeah, I'm just gonna sit for a bit.

463
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,128
You've done your fair share.

464
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,098
Government's getting serious.
There's looting going on.

465
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,143
Looting?

466
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,722
HE SCOFFS

467
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,649
I saw a movie a few months back
where something like this happened.

468
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:31,565
It was very believable.

469
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,445
But I never bought the looting.

470
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,066
“Hey everyone's getting sick,
so let's...

471
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,694
"Let's break that window
and steal that TV."

472
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,278
I... I don't get that.

473
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,575
Me neither.

474
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,241
I mean, you get a pretty decent TV
for next to nothing nowadays

475
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,910
compared to what I got mine for? God.

476
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,374
David.
- The expensive part is the cable.

477
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,546
David...

478
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,667
Go home.

479
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,003
Yeah.

480
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,594
No, I, I'm waiting for Marcy to come by.

481
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,722
Maybe I should go home.

482
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,847
It's a good idea.

483
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,183
I should've swung that fucking axe.

484
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,936
Forbes would've shot you.

485
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,185
Thirty percent of the human population...

486
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,653
Including all of you.

487
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,481
TREVOR:
Boss, you can't blame yourself

488
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,907
for not being able to foresee
the unthinkable.

489
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,614
That's why they call it “unthinkable...

490
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,489
Can't think it.
- Still, I know how you feel.

491
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,786
I'm the one that provided
the Faction with the virus.

492
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,537
You were drugged.

493
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,080
Again.

494
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,703
Stop. It's done.

495
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,172
You know, I've been
wondering about that.

496
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,171
Maybe the Director can undo this.

497
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:19,714
How?

498
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,929
The future can only send
a consciousness back

499
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,006
as far as the most recent
Traveler, right?

500
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,180
And Travelers are arriving all the time

501
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,594
all over the world

502
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,263
as part of the Grand Plan...

503
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,770
but the last one had to have
been months ago...

504
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,023
before the Director went down.

505
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,817
Before all this happened.

506
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,358
The Faction might not be able to send
consciousness back

507
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,781
or establish a TELL,
but messengers count.

508
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,784
It's still a transfer of information
from the future.

509
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:50,328
TREVOR COUGHS He's right.

510
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,958
Messengers cause the same ripples in
space-time as Travelers.

511
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,547
PHILIP: And we know the Faction has
sent messengers recently.

512
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,170
They thought of everything.

513
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,129
Well, guys, on the bright side...

514
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,889
We're almost home.

515
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,180

516
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,683
Hard to believe where we're walking
right now

517
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,852
is under a kilometre of ice
in a few hundred years.

518
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,863
The domes get built right over there.

519
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,445
We've only ever seen the shelters
from the inside.

528
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,833
She shouldn't be having
respiratory issues at this stage.

529
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,467
You didn't trust me. I had no choice.

530
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,547
What'd you do?

531
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,969
I instructed the nanites

532
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:28,631
to pull the virus into red blood cells
where it can't survive.

533
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,890
She should be getting better.

534
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,142
The Faction predicted that countermeasure.

535
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,312
The virus blocks red blood cells' ability
to carry oxygen.

536
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,559
She's suffocating.

537
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,641
MARCY: Turn them off!
- Deactivating the nanites

538
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:42,148
will be like flushing them down the drain!
- Turn them off or she's gonna die.

539
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,062
Either way, they're useless now.

00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,077
No, she's not better!

543
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,837
She's right back to where she started.

544
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:01,714
They've been ahead of us this whole time.

545
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,462
Did you not think the Faction was gonna
factor in nanites?

546
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,377
This is all because you didn't trust me!

547
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,798
Why should I?

548
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,551
You're alive because of me.

549
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,839
And perfectly healthy.

550
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,969
Am I?

551
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,309
When you reset me

552
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,890
you left out some things.

553
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,179
What'd you leave out, Grace?

554
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,935
This is what you want to talk about

555
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,066
when we're all dying?
- I'm not dying! You are.

No, I'm good.

OK. Come on.

Where are you taking it?

578
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,886

Somewhere it can't power the Director.

Oh, come on.

580
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,182
Of course we knew you'd try
something like this

581
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,558
when you didn't get the uranium.

582
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,060
Don't beat yourself up!

583
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,229
You're a good team,
and we need numbers.

584
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,727
We should be working together.

585
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,273
I don't think so.

586
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,068
The Director had its chance.

587
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,900
Didn't change a goddamn
thing in the future!

588
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,522
Other than create the Faction.

Why can't I wrap my head around that shit?
- Why am I not surprised?

592
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:25,667
Alright.

593
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:27,916
Thanks for the plutonium.

594
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,206
We'll make sure to put it to good use.

Let's go!
- MACLEAN: Plutonium?

596
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,920
What... You think we brought a nuclear
warhead in here?

597
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,972
I thought you said that they were
watching all of our communications.

598
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,850
There was a typo
in my Admiral Donahue email that...

599
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:43,343
It may have thrown them off.

600
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,972
When I wrote “Mark 45 warhead”
instead of, uh...

601
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,898
What was it? Mark 46?
- Oh! Oh, right.

602
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,521
The 45 was nuclear.
That makes total sense.

603
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,738
PHILIP: Except the Mark 45 torpedo
was decommissioned in 1976.

604
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,235
On a Wednesday.

605
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,151
Never in a million years

606
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:01,616
could we get a nuclear warhead
from a US naval station.

607
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,913
Your friends just walked away
with a conventional

The cure has been sent to the 21st.

628
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,008
FORBES: The encrypted beacon
on the device was activated

629
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,670
almost the moment power
to the Director was cut off.

630
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,005
It took some time for us
to find and recover it

00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,966
but we got to it without them knowing...

632
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,972
Even when we broke through,
the energy source was only capable

633
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,680
of powering the Director for three seconds.

634
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,483
Enough time for the Director to reroute the
power to itself through the network.

635
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,232
Cut off the Faction's
access to the reactor.

00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,317
How many Faction are still here?

The Director won't have a TELL
for all of them.

641
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,248

643
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,341
MACLAREN: Kat?
Grant.

644
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,134
I have been so worried.

645
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,090
I've been trying to call you.
<i>- I know, sorry.</i>

646
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,131
<i>But all the work we've been doing,
it 's paid off.</i>

647
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,260
You're gonna be OK.

648
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,683
<i>I'm so sick.
Don't say that if it's not real.</i>

649
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,512
No, I promise, we've had a breakthrough.
Watch the news.

650
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,352
I... I'll be... I'll be back with you
as fast as I can.

651
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,271
I'm worried about the baby.

652
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,853
I'll be back tomorrow at the latest.

653
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,733
HELICOPTERS APPROACH

654
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,027
Maybe sooner.

655
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,543
He didn't answer.

656
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,726
We did it.

657
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,013
That means we should be able
to wake you up soon.

658
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,315
GRACE:
One, she can't hear you.

659
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,893
Two... I can't believe
you're giving her the cure first.

660
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,978
I'm standing right here!
- Boyd is far more sick.

661
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,654
Am I at least next?

662
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:09,406
No. The newly arrived Traveler
in her very sick host body, then you.

663
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,203
Oh, just admit you hate me.

664
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,122
TV BLARES

665
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:23,794
Kat?

666
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,551
Sweetheart, hey. Hey, wake up.

667
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,714
Oh... You're home?

668
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,463
And I've got something for you.

669

TURNS TV OFF

670
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:32,678
Come on.

671
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,263
What is it?

672
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:37,183
No, I can't take any medicine,
in case it affects the baby.

673
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,230
I got this directly from the CDC.

674
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:41,604
I made sure to ask.
It's perfectly safe.

675
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,114
It works really fast.

676
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:01,787
I'm going to let you sleep.

677
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,332
No. Can you just lie with me
for a bit?

678
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,215
Just for a minute.

679
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,418
I would like nothing more.

680
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,650
Jeff?

681
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,243
Jeffrey?

682
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,239
Jeffrey!

683
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,119

CHILD CRIES

685
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,703
I know you were trying to call.
I had to get this first.

686
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,088
It's a treatment for the virus.

687
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,919
What? Where did you get it?

688
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,834
CHILD CRIES
- It doesn't matter.

689
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,799
It'll cure you both.

690
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,885
I was so scared.

691
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,349
I didn't know what to do.
You didn't come home.

692
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,347
I didn't know what to do but hold him.

00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,272
Give him to me. I know.

696
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:08,733
I'm supposed to go to work
soon as you got home, but...

697
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:10,657
It's OK.

698
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,066
Just rest a while first.

699
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:16,115
CARLY: I know. I know, I know.
- Yeah, I think I will.

No.

00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,976
No, I was helping out at one
of the shelters. David...

713
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,436
You could have been exposed.

Yeah, I was.

00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,611
The people I work with

716
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,191
are the first ones to be forgotten
when something like this happens.

717
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,988
You're not gonna give me that, are you?

718
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,444
Only if you're sick.

719
00:40:58,623 --> 00:40:59,704
Speaking of sick...

720
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,203
This man I know just collapsed...

721
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,037
while I was trying to get him soup.

722
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,455
Your pulse is good.

723
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,415
And while they were wheeling him out...

724
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:15,004
I felt like one of those minor characters
in a movie that does not end well.

725
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,260
And I thought to myself...

726
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,303
“Marcy's gonna give me shit
if I end up dying from this.”

727
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,146
Because I can't help myself.

728
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,895
You mean from helping others?

729
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,692
Yeah, but isn't that what you do too?

730
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,028
Open your mouth.
- Your way of doing things...

731
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,610
GARBLED: is more impressive.

732
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,866
Right. Well, you're not sick.

733
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,408
Well, maybe you should give me
the shot anyway.

734
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,743
No symptoms.

735
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,704
If you were exposed,
it means you're immune.

736
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:52,499
So, find your friend who collapsed
and give this to him.

737
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,506
OK?
- Yeah.

738

What, you're leaving again?

Wow. House call.

I'll also live, thanks for asking.
