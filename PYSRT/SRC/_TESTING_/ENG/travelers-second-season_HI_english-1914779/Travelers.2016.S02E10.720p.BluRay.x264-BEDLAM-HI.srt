1
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,841
BREE:
He thinks you don't like him.

2
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,610
ANNA: You know what,
who cares if I don't?

3
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:01,965
Well, he does.

4
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,724
He should get over it.

5
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,138
Anna, I don't think you get it.

6
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,895
Don't think I get what?

7
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,691
Bree?

8
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,235
Bree?

9
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,854
Anna Hamilton?
I'm Agent Hall with the FBI.

10
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,626
For your safety,
I need you to come with me.

11
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,798
What happened to my friends?
- HALL: Your friends are gonna be fine

12
00:03:22,844 --> 00:03:24,964
but you won't be,
unless you get in the car right now.

13
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:25,988
Tell me why.

14
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,075
SHE SCREAMS
No! No! No!

15
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,976
BREE: Anna? Anna!

16
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,309
Anna!

17
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,450
MARCY: What... will.. you... be?

18
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:13,118
What w-will you b-become?

19
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,495
That's so good!

20
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,418
You wanna try the next part?

21
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,332
No.

22
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,091
Come on, girl.
You can do it.

23
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:23,965
Tomorrow.

24
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,596
It can't always be "tomorrow".

25
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,506
I'm here now, so let's try it.

26
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:30,642
Marcy! Mercy me.
Time to rock and roll.

27
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,348
This is her reading time.

28
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,810
The man wants to see her now,
which makes it treatment time.

29
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,099
Let's go.

30
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,984
I told her
she didn't have to go today.

31
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,111
Well, you shouldn't
have said that, bud.

32
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,362
I don't...

33
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,569
I don't want t-treatment!

34
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,653
No! No!

35
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,491
Hey. She's a person.
Treat her with respect.

36
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,201
You do your fucking job,
or you won't have one.

37
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,333
I don't want to go...
I don't wanna go!

38
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,289
I'll be here for you
when it's over.

39
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,579
MARCY: No!

40
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,632
James! James!

41
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,176
I don't want treatment!

42
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,383
I don't want it.

43
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,887
I don't want it.

44
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,933
Hey. Hey.

45
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,392
Behave

46
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:12,847
or there'll be
no ice cream after.

47
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,480
I don't want it.
I don't want it.

48
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,107
I don't want it.

49
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,483
VINCENT: Dear, sweet Marcy.

50
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,238
Don't be afraid, dear.

51
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,481
I have no desire to hurt you

52
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,696
and I mean that sincerely.

53
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,986
No, quite the opposite.

54
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,705
I only want
to make you whole again.

55
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,830
What'd the messenger say?

56
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,624
Another Traveler team
needs tactical support

57
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,338
in less than an hour
at these coordinates.

58
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,094
PHILIP: Got it.
Where's the boss?

59
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,842
Mac, where are you?

60
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,555
TREVOR: Must be off-com.

61
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,908
We can stop by
Kathryn's place on the way.

62
00:05:52,932 --> 00:05:53,596
Where's Marcy?

63
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,680
She just texted me.

64
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,517
She's having some kind
of medical procedure.

65
00:05:57,566 --> 00:05:59,606
We're just gonna have to do
the mission without her.

66
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,063
OK, so nobody get shot today.

67
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,632
TREVOR: That's a good rule in general.

68
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,408
Hello?

69
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,389
I'm so sorry to bother you
at home, Kathryn.

70
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,949
What?
How do you know my name?

71
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,363
He's one of my C.I.'s

72
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:16,157
who knows better
than to come here.

73
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,950
It's an urgent C.I. thing.

74
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:18,868
MACLAREN: Alright.

75
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,287
Are you the one
who stole my husband's car?

76
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,779
Well, actually,
that's a funny story.

77
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,044
For another time.

78
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:25,593
Be back soon.

79
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,972
Look, um...

80
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,607
I need this job.

81
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,158
Just, uh...

82
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,410
Don't let it melt.

83
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,129
Marcy?

84
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:03,881
Did it work this time?

85
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,377
I told him information transfer
was way, way too slow.

86
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
I tried to fix it.

87
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,052
To get you back in...

88
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,058
You're still in there.

89
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,640
You don't know
because you're not here.

90
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
He knows.

91
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,734
I'll keep trying

92
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,111
but squid transistors
barely even exist here and now.

93
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,698
You gonna eat that?

94
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,117
Can I have it?

95
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,954
OK.

96
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,626
Well, if they're after me,
then...

97
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,787
how do you know
my parents are safe?

98
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,206
Well, because
they're also under protection.

99
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,738
Right? And that's
question number six.

100
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,755
Oh, fuck me.

101
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,137
What the fuck
are you doing here?

102
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,786
I'm not exactly
thrilled about it either.

103
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,552
We got a messenger.
Tactical support at these coordinates.

104
00:08:02,576 --> 00:08:03,576
Tactical?

105
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,693
I don't know.
I, uh, I think we're good.

106
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,257
The Director doesn't seem to think so.

107
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,104
Where are all the customers?

108
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,239
You ever eat here?

109
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,284
I like it.

110
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:17,955
Who's she?

111
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,906
That's, uh, 53.

112
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,034
As in "P.O.T.U.S."

113
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,878
Centuries before my time,
but I'm pretty sure

114
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,914
the 53rd President
was another old white guy.

115
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:32,085
Do you even remember
the other candidate that year?

116
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,673
How close that election was

117
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,633
and how the country
was torn apart after?

118
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,300
Anna, say hello
to Special Agent MacLaren.

119
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,874
It's an honor to meet you,
Ms Hamilton.

120
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:48,694
Hi.

121
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,521
So, are you assigned
to protect me, too?

122
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,986
Actually...
- Yeah, he is. Until 1600 hours.

123
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,777
Why do I need protection?
- Hey, we had an agreement, right?

124
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,536
Ten questions?
You're already at eight.

125
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Ten questions?

126
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,781
Yeah, whatever.

127
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:03,853
MACLAREN: What happens at 1600?

128
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,208
HALL: How the hell
should I know?

129
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,585
All I gotta do is make sure that,
until then, she's...

130
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,745
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

131
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,288
Get her to cover now. Now!

132
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,260
FBI! Get down and stay down!

133
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,270
We just lost a camera.

134
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,558
<i>Tracking four targets..</i>

135
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,646
You call this "tactical"?

136
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,398
Carly! Trevor?
- Ready, boss!

137
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,903
In position.

138
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,101
Trevor, your 9:00, moving toward
the west side of the restaurant.

139
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,265
The Director got the last one.

140
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,796
We can't count on the Director
to have eyes everywhere.

141
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,730
We should move.

142
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,690
Stand by.
We're moving somewhere safe.

143
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,568
You know, we were fine
until you showed up.

144
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,857
They must've followed you.

145
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,670
If we hadn't been
ordered here, you'd be dead

146
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,818
and so would 53

147
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,828
who I am taking
to a safe-house right now

148
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,873
with or without you.

149
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,291
MacLaren's right.

150
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,460
We should go.

151
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,673
MONITOR BEEPS

153
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,930
DRAKE: Come on, girl. Eat up.

154
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,386
I don't have time for this shit.

155
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:45,809
You know what happens
if you don't.

156
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,595
MARCY: I w-want to go home.

157
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,933
This is your home now.

158
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,560
No, I w-work here.

159
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,022
Get that outta your head.

160
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,778
I remember.

161
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,688
Alright.

162
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,777
Doesn't have to be the hard way.

163
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,736
Don't make me do this.

164
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,785
Hey!

165
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,853
You do it again
and I'll report you!

166
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,447
You'll report me?

167
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,288
I'm not the one who looks at her ass
every time she walks away.

168
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:13,107
I don't do that.

169
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,542
Don't get me wrong, it's a...

170
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,253
Treat her with respect,
or I'll talk to Dr Carroll.

171
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:18,302
Carroll?

172
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,630
Ha! That's perfect.

173
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,544
Boom!

174
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,053
Yeah, you go ahead and do that

175
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,180
while I feed
your hot little girlfriend.

176
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,605
DRAKE: You are done.

177
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,983
Don't even bother signing out.

178
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,393
I don't wanna see your face.

179
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,708
I need to use the bathroom.

180
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,709
It's not far now.

181
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,434
You just have to hold it
a little longer...

182
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,913
Madame President.

183
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,505
So in this timeline,
she actually wins the election.

184
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,090
Why would the faction
not want that?

185
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,819
'Cause they're working off
old information.

186
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,719
Where are we going?

187
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,509
That's an excellent question, Anna.

188
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,601
You, uh, you got one left.

189
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,028
MACLAREN: It's an old farmhouse that
I know of. We should be safe there.

190
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:15,510
That's what Special Agent Hall
said about the restaurant.

191
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,486
"Agent"?

192
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,655
"Special".

193
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,238
Why isn't Marcy with you?

194
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,944
Some sort of
minor medical procedure

195
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,108
I wish she'd told me about.

196
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,242
Is she alright?

197
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,622
I'm sure she's fine.

198
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,510
Simon...
that's beautiful.

199
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:53,832
SIMON: Thank you.

200
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,856
I like it.

201
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,067
Who is she?

202
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:58,694
0092.

203
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,315
No, I mean, what's her name?

204
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,695
0092.

205
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,027
She's not born
for another two...

206
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,617
no, hundreds of years from now.

207
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,154
Oh! That's
a very long time.

208
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,492
Yes, it is.

209
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,827
Home, sweet home...

210
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,625
The ozone layer is gone by then.

211
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,082
That's just one problem.

212
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,997
In a hundred years,
there are way worse...

213
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,084
we live under the ice.

214
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,174
Oh...

215
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,551
The math's not that complicated

216
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,436
You have two people
that want the same thing...

217
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,550
the two people fight over the one,
and then there's none.

218
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,967
Well...

219
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,228
I have

220
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,273
two pills...

221
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,269
For one person.

222
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,650
OK? There you go.

223
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,813
I'm not supposed to take
anything before treatment.

224
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,031
Marcy, isn't it?

225
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:49,555
Uh, yeah.

226
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:50,910
Good, I was hoping to catch you.

227
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,537
Simon is correct

228
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,742
that I prefer he not be medicated
during the treatment.

229
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,750
Oh, well, there's
a daily schedule, Mr Ingram.

230
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,995
SIMON: Maintenance of the yeast vats,
first and foremost

231
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:01,879
is your responsibility
to the community.

232
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,631
Please, Simon...

233
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,633
allow me to speak
with the orderly.

234
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,631
You go on ahead.

235
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,062
An hour is all I ask.

236
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,731
Dr Carroll approves.
You can check with her.

237
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,609
Dr Carroll's gone home,
and I-I can't...

238
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,611
Perhaps if you understood more
about the therapy I was working on.

239
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,212
You're curious.
Of course, you're curious...

240
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:30,271
More concerned.

241
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,362
<i>A</i> few of the patients who've
gone through your treatment...

242
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:34,975
haven't...

243
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,239
returned to the ward?

244
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,795
Because they've been transferred
to another hospital

245
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,047
as promising candidates
for further research.

246
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:46,333
I can show you the paperwork.

247
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,265
The work we're doing here is truly
for the greater good, Marcy.

248
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,143
We're making progress,
I promise.

249
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,983
In fact...

250
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,735
if you're open to it,
I could use your help.

251
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,580
It's a nice spot.

252
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,911
Glad you approve.

253
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,701
A sign on the road
says it's for sale.

254
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,834
Might be a good investment.

255
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,961
FBI seized the house
from a meth cook

256
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,668
who burned himself to death
in the kitchen, so...

257
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:27,957
So, big kitchen?

258
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,132
I need you to set
these claymores up

259
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,466
there and there.

260
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,550
We can do that.

261
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,079
Conceal 'em best you can,
then run the wires back to the house.

262
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,659
What, you take orders
from your tactician?

263
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
So should you.

264
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,104
Hey, look, I can still tell
you got a problem with me

265
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:46,593
but you gotta get
over that, alright?

266
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,743
The Director keeps
putting us together.

267
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:48,978
Must be some good reason.

268
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,567
"Ours is not to reason why."

269
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,072
It's like we're two disciples

270
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,238
but we don't see eye to eye.

271
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,606
I'm not in the mood
for mythology.

272
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,948
But we're both disciples, right

273
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,579
so what're you gonna do?

274
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,364
Hey, look, what
I'm trying to say...

275
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,158
Don't you fucking touch me, Hall!

276
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,666
Take it easy.
Relax.

277
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,788
Let's just get to 1600.

278
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,127
DRONE WHIRS

279
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,547
GUNSHOTS

280
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,107
VINCENT: The technology scans the brain

281
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,735
and records specific patterns

282
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,734
not dissimilar
to something like an MRI.

283
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,361
What exactly am I signing?

284
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,244
Legalese.

285
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,995
The fee for allowing me
to perform the scans

286
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,454
is on the last page.

287
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,339
That's a lot of money.

288
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,542
Is it?

289
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,046
I'm embarrassed to say
that I've lost perspective.

290
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,767
Simon...
what are you doing here?

291
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,564
I helped build the first one
in the future, too.

292
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:11,613
Good for you.

293
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,322
He likes to "assist."

294
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,074
I consider it
part of his therapy.

295
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,781
Um, Mr Ingram...

296
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,536
uh, I've changed my mind.

297
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,039
You've signed the papers,
you can't.

298
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,084
I just did.

299
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,122
Marcy, it's a harmless scan.

300
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,036
You won't feel it.

301
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,769
Sorry, I don't...
I don't feel comfortable.

302
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:31,256
Please, be reasonable.

303
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,041
I'm sorry.
You can keep your money.

304
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,426
It's not about
the money, my dear

305
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,553
but now you've seen the device.

306
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,088
This is awkward.

307
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,222
Drake!

308
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,060
Move!
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

309
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,437
MARCY: Let go of me!

310
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,064
MARCY SCREAMS

311
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,110
You really should read
everything you sign.

312
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,195
MARCY: No!

313
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,799
I'm always in awe
of the potential of youth.

314
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:24,722
Of what may come.

315
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,186
Even if we didn't know
who she was.

316
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,430
If we succeed in our mission

317
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,066
she'll become one of the great leaders
of a generation.

318
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,111
Mm-hmm.

319
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,442
So I'd very much like
to make it to 4 o'clock.

320
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,128
TREVOR: I wonder if it's a coincidence
that the Director assigned you

321
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,784
a mission to preserve
the life of a child

322
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,349
after what happened
to you and Kathryn.

323
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,369
I think the Director
isn't a licensed therapist

324
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,079
and neither are you.

325
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,768
I do understand
what you're going through.

326
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:52,566
You couldn't possibly.

327
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,921
Yeah, I do.

328
00:18:55,278 --> 00:18:56,278
Even you forget.

329
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,420
I've lived long enough to see
two of my own sons die of old age.

330
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,843
Uh, no. This isn't
the same thing.

331
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,132
You're right, it isn't.

332
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,554
You're grieving a life lost
that hadn't even begun yet.

333
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,895
A loss of potential.

334
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,770
Anna has that.

335
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,527
All I'm saying.

336
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,410
We got vehicles.

337
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,490
MACLAREN: Yeah. I see 'em. Anna!

338
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,782
Get inside.

339
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,623
The Director will, too,
as soon as they get closer.

340
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,004
Smile for the camera,
Mr Faction.

341
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,398
ROBOTIC VOICE:
Protocol Three is suspended.

342
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,677
Protect Anna Hamilton at all costs

343
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,554
and hold until reinforcements arrive.

344
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,475
NORMAL VOICE:
What just happened?

345
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,637
Nothing happened.
Just go inside.

346
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,690
You're fine.

347
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,610
Here I thought we were gonna make it
to 1600 without any trouble.

348
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,121
DRAKE: She doesn't even recognize me.

349
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,789
There was a malfunction.

350
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,833
Some information
was lost during the scan.

351
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,876
Simon is working
to restore it soon.

352
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,794
Simon?

353
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,635
Until then, Marcy is now to be
considered a patient of this facility

354
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,344
under the care of Dr Carroll.

355
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,134
Dr Carroll agreed to that?

356
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,267
And so will you.

357
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,064
I can make you very wealthy,
very easily.

358
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,482
We can move patients
to different wings

359
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:43,444
but there'll still be staff
who know Marcy as an employee.

360
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,325
Bribe those you can
and get rid of the rest.

361
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,903
I leave it to you.

362
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,682
CARLY: The Director should turn
every one of them into hosts

363
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,459
or kill them by messenger
as soon as they're on camera.

364
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,163
Maybe Anna should hide
upstairs and wait...

365
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:18,558
Don't. If they
don't find her

366
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,091
they'll burn this
place to the ground.

367
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,774
It's what I'd do.

368
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,615
Really?

369
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,737
And you...

370
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,364
keep your head down.

371
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,778
Why do they want to hurt me?

372
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,247
Because they're afraid of you.

373
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,453
More than you?

374
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,084
Even more than me, yes.

375
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,036
Why don't we just talk to them?

376
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,883
Wow.

377
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,468
Even now...

378
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,591
Anna, this won't happen

379
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,637
but if they manage
to get through this door

380
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,221
and they try to take you

381
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,510
fight them

382
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,346
and you keep fighting

383
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,105
because help is on the way. OK?

384
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:01,986
OK.

385
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,451
PHILIP: No, I can do this.

386
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:14,239
MARCY: We have a mission today.
You're no good to anyone like this.

387
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,532
Oh god, that's better.

388
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,078
Just enough for you to function. Here.

389
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,794
Back to human. Thanks.

390
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,470
Well, that's what I'm here for.

391
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,755
But when I'm gone...

392
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:31,808
Don't say that.

393
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:37,804
It's going to happen,
and probably soon.

394
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:43,101
The seizures are just getting worse
and I can't stop them.

395
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,066
MONITOR BEEPS RAPIDLY

396
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,174
HALL: Seriously?

397
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,462
That's all we got.

398
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,469
No, this'll help.

399
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,638
Didn't think the Director
would let them get this close.

400
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,231
We can't wait for the Director.

401
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,941
Aim centre mass.
Shoot when I shoot.

402
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:41,396
Oh! Crash!

403
00:24:42,106 --> 00:24:44,564
Sorry. I didn't see that...
that move comin'.

404
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,608
Are you OK?

405
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,434
I... I'm fine.

406
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:50,947
I'm fine.

407
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,106
Uh... I was... I was watching you
there a little bit

408
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,571
and I was thinking
you looked lost.

409
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,287
Maybe I can help.

410
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,698
Is there some family that I can...?
- Mm. Mm.

411
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,143
Turns out we're going
the same way anyway.

412
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,713
Um, what's your name?

413
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,839
Uh, M... Marcy.

414
00:25:11,821 --> 00:25:12,821
Marcy?

415
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:14,051
Yeah.
- Seriously?

416
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:14,961
Yeah.

417
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:19,008
That is easily in my top ten
favourite names in the whole world.

418
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,845
You're the first one
I've met in person.

419
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,347
My name's David.

420
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
MONITOR BEEPS RAPIDLY

421
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,443
Four of them are coming around
the south side of the house.

422
00:25:43,467 --> 00:25:44,923
Hall, that's you!

423
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,242
I know! I know!

424
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,832
It's like the fucking Alamo!
Where's the Director?

425
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,249
They've gotta have an S.T.A.!

426
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:55,321
What?

427
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,383
"Space-Time Attenuation" device.

428
00:25:58,432 --> 00:26:01,390
It creates a field around 'em in which
the Director can't see 'em.

429
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,891
I see the S.T.A.!
It's in the green truck under the tarp!

430
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:09,599
Trevor...
we need an end-run.

431
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,732
Go.

432
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,311
TREVOR: Son of a bitch!

433
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,193
HALL: Cover him!

434
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,698
Cover him!

435
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,746
Like I said, it isn't much...

436
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,467
But it's not the street

437
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,752
and it's subsidised.

438
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,090
Do... Do you live... here?

439
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,974
No.

440
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,384
This is your place now, remember?

441
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,353
<i>See,</i> there's a...

442
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,684
there's a bed in here with...

443
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,018
clean sheets, like I promised

444
00:26:55,257 --> 00:26:56,257
and...

445
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,147
good, there's a towel, too.

446
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,067
And a dresser
for all your things.

447
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,216
So first thing tomorrow,
we'll... we'll go...

448
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,240
get you some things.

449
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,210
And here,
there's a little fridge

450
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,461
to keep your milk
for your cereal or your tea.

451
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:18,546
Do you like tea?

452
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,155
Oh, looks like the previous tenant
left a big chunk of chocolate!

453
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,512
No, that's hash.

454
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,678
Take that away.

455
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:27,562
And...

456
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,774
Good!
That works, too.

457
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,480
You have a light
to read your book by.

458
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,940
MARCY GIGGLES

459
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,363
So, I will let you
get settled in.

460
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,825
N-No... d-don't go.

461
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,908
Oh, I have to go.

462
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,707
I have other clients.

463
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:54,336
I-I did look up the hospital
you said you were a patient at.

464
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,462
I w-work there.

465
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,042
You work there?
- Mm-hmm.

466
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,334
Huh.

467
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,003
Well, that's different.

468
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,975
Either way, they said
they have no record of you.

469
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:04,967
Oh!

470
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,678
MARCY: Don't go!

471
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,727
OK.

472
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:12,184
I still have to go.

473
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,648
But I will be back
tomorrow morning

474
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,149
to take you shopping.

475
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,274
Oh, don't do that.

476
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:21,324
Oh, uh...

477
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,527
OK?
- OK.

478
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,914
Don't forget to lock up.

479
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:31,959
OK.

480
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:40,426
OK.

481
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,363
MARCY: David?

482
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,369
DAVID: Surprise!

483
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,615
Hey.

484
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:11,747
I know I said the paperwork
was gonna take seven days, but...

485
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,499
It only took a week.

486
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,209
Oh, you put some pictures up.

487
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,763
Nice.

488
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,600
Uh, so this is the paperwork
we need to sign

489
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,244
in order to get you
something to live on.

490
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,761
I've already filled out
most of it

491
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,226
we're just missing some things.

492
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,275
Um...

493
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,503
Do you happen
to remember your birthday?

494
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,313
Well, that's not a problem.

495
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,528
We'll... We'll...
We'll pick a day.

496
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,611
Oh...

497
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,026
Oh, wait! It's today.

498
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,319
What are the odds?

499
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,197
Well, one in 365

500
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,537
but so long as
we're saying today...

501
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:01,956
It's for... for my birth... birthday?

502
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:02,874
DAVID: Yeah.

503
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,406
Everybody deserves
a birthday present.

504
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,138
It's not brand-new

505
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,595
but, uh, it'll hold your stuff
when you go outside.

506
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,686
My mum always says
that it's bad luck

507
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:22,856
to give a bag as a gift
without putting money in it...

508
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:27,190
which, I guess, is why I asked
for a new bag every Christmas.

509
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,526
The only thing we need
to figure out now is your age.

510
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,073
I'm guessing
somewhere between 22 and 26.

511
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,084
You pick.

512
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,742
You pick.

516
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,469
No!

517
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,801
Well, you told me to pick.

518
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,717
OK. We'll go...

519
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,601
We'll go with 25.

00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,972

Understood.

526
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,391
It stopped short of the mines.

Mm-hmm.

Well, that deserves a...

You're m-my...
you're my boyfriend.

00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,605
I-I can't be your boyfriend.

I can be your friend.

It's not because I don't like you

it would be inappropriate.

when I was gonna be home

657
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,245
It's OK.
I was just dozing.

658
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,708
Everything OK?

659
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,083
Yeah. Everything's fine.

660
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,378
I saved a kid today.

661
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,290
David?

662
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,300
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

663
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,068
DAVID: Oh. OK. Well,
I'll talk to you later.

664
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:42,886
Hey.

665
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:43,935
Hi.

666
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,273
I wanted to talk to you
before you left for work.

667
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:48,646
Yeah, no, I, uh...

668
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,191
thought maybe you'd want
to thaw some more.

669
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,572
Can we talk?

670
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,574
Sure.

671
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,057
If you wouldn't have found the note,
you would have never known.

672
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:05,874
Doesn't make it better.

673
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,708
It was the only way, David.

674
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:09,753
To do what?

675
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,837
To find the missing
pieces of myself.

676
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,382
To find you.

677
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,425
OK, so?

678
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,242
Was it worth
almost killing yourself?

679
00:43:17,266 --> 00:43:19,177
Because honestly, this is...

680
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,360
Well, that was different.

681
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,400
I'm sorry that I scared you.

682
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,900
You have no idea.

683
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:43,954
If I hadn't...

684
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,584
What?

685
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,131
What is it?

686
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,215
Do you know who did this?

687
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:00,381
Uh, yeah...

688
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,011
some homeless guy,
lives around here.

689
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,056
Why?

690
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,844
I need you to take me to him.
