Grant...

3
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,561
Grant?

4
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:26,270
Grant, we are not spending that much
on football tickets!

5
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,275
Have you seen these seats?
This is a bargain.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,231
Do not get caught in a bidding war.

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,443
Kat, it's for charity!
Think of the children.

8
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,741
I wonder how my steak knives are doing.
- No, Grant-

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,242
Doesn't cost nothing to look!

10
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,904
Oh, shit, I'm sorry, that was my fault.

11
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,369
Let me get you another one.
Do you want another one, too?

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,076
I'm going to get you one.
I'll get us all one.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,915
My husband doesn't get out much.

14
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,003
Neither do I.

15
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,969
This is a great event.

16
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,254
Do you work for the hospital?

17
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,641
Someone my wife was very close to
received care here.

18
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,142
We became supporters.

19
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,605
You?

20
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,938
Uh, we live nearby.

21
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:08,190
I donated a chair.

22
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,227
You endowed a new position.

23
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,688
SHE LAUGHS Oh, sorry, no...

24
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:18,071
Um, I literally gave them a chair.
I'm a designer.

25
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,078
Is the chair in the auction?

26
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:21,988
It is.

27
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,624
And I would be very happy
to show it to you, Mr...?

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,669
Ingram.

29
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,623
But please call me Vincent.

30
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,707
Kathryn.

31
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,130
Kathryn.

32
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:34,719
Um...

33
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,969
It doesn't have any bids, unfortunately.

34
00:01:37,657 --> 00:01:39,617
Well, we'll have to see
what we can do about that.

35
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,724
My wife always put us down
for all...

36
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,310
The, ah...

37
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,519
all the auction items
that could use a little support.

38
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,854
She sounds lovely.

39
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,688
She was. Unfortunately, she...

40
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,334
Forgive me, this work
has left me speechless.

41
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,710
It's beautiful, isn't it?

42
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,831
Apparently, these were created
by one of the patients.

43
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,984
Do you see a piece you like, Mr Ingram?

44
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,248
All of them.

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,121
I'll buy all of them.

46
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,194
GUN FIRES

47
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,491
Beth, where's the Petrov file?

48
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:32,146
Excuse me?

49
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,411
All my material on the Petrov case,
it was right here.

50
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,704
It was reassigned.

51
00:03:36,193 --> 00:03:37,193
Why?

52
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,174
We weren't expecting you all week.

53
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,334
Well, I'm here.

54
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:44,927
I can see that, but no-one
would think worse of you if you weren't.

55
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:46,716
What is that supposed to mean?

56
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,100
Nothing, I was just trying to be nice.

57
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,189
Here.

58
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,228
Knock yourself out.

59
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,316
He keeps to himself mostly.

60
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,407
He has some issues with coherent thought
but, hey, who doesn't?

61
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,662
How long have you known him?

62
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,368
About a year, year and a half?

63
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,624
I met him, actually, not long after
I met you.

64
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,417
He's a good person inside,

65
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,170
he just doesn't trust many people.

66
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,047
Paranoid? Delusional?

67
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,675
Oh, yeah. He's on a mission from
"the Director."

68
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,085
Whatever that means.

69
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,964
Hey, here's some more.

70
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,477
They look new.

71
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,948
Just finished.

72
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,368
Hi, Marcy.

73
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,661
I like your hair.

74
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,706
It looks nice.

91
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,030
Thank you!

92
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,443
You say something?
- Hmm?

93
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,537
I like those moves.
SHE CHUCKLES

94
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,080
I'll see you tonight?

95
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,465
Hey!

96
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,458
You bring it on yourself.

97
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,058
You know, I should have asked
if you want to drive.

98
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,427
Give you the practise.

99
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,727
In a few years, cars are going to be
driving themselves.

100
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,569
That's true.

101
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,820
You know, your mother and I heard about

102
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,655
what's going on with your coach
at school.

103
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,872
Nobody had any idea that was happening.

104
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,413
He seemed like a normal guy.

105
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,749
I hope he fries - sick bastard.

106
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,427
Anyway, uh...

107
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,216
I want you to know that we're here for you

108
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,886
if you ever want to talk about it
or whatever.

109
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:17,676
We'd feel awful if anything like that...

110
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,929
You don't have to worry, Gary.

111
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,606
It didn't happen to me.

112
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,025
Yeah, good.

113
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,527
Good.

114
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,112
That's what I figured.

115
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,694
No way, not my son.

116
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,536
Yeah.

117
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:51,043
So strange to see these in the 21st...

118
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,383
I remember him from the institution.

119
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:58,829
You do?

120
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:01,561
Host memories from a long time ago.

121
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,478
Which means he's several years
into a psychotic existence.

122
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,779
Hey, Simon.

123
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,987
Simon, this is a friend of mine,
he has a couple questions for you.

124
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,110
Questions, yeah, right.

125
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,244
You got a gun, I can see it.

126
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,529
I see everything.

127
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,406
And I'm on your side, Simon.

128
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,917
Can you tell me your Traveler number?

129
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,463
Do you remember any of the rest of
your team or where they might be?

130
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,087
I checked the area in the shelter
where he sleeps.

131
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,051
<i>Seems</i> like he's been on his own
for a while.

132
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,590
You want what's in my head

133
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,351
but there's just so much
that you don't understand.

134
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,888
You might be surprised
what we can understand.

135
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,773
OK, so you know that an emission
of Hawking radiation

136
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,025
concerns two mutually
entangled particles?

137
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:51,007
Who doesn't?

138
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,817
And if that particle enters a black hole

139
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,951
it emits a finite amount of information,
leaving you with what?

140
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,495
A paradox.

141
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,280
The monogamy of entanglement

142
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,783
requires that the
outgoing particle be fixed

143
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,951
inside two independent systems
at the same time.

144
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,417
Definitely upper echelon.

145
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,672
Probably a specialist.

146
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,876
Is that right, Simon?
Are you a specialist?

147
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,464
Yes, I am.

148
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,379
And if you don't believe me,
ask the Director!

149
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,718
Ask the...
<i>- Simon.</i>

150
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,515
Shut up.

151
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,310
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...

152
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,312
Hey, Simon? Simon...?
- No, I can't.

153
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,357
He's here.

154
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,937
Who's here?

155
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:29,985
I can't!

156
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,737
That's Vincent Ingram.

157
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,533
Yes, it is.

158
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,621
How do you know that? You never met.
There are no photographs.

159
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,161
He was at the institution.

160
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,246
He experimented on patients.

161
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,001
And you remember that?

162
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,629
He's 001.

163
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,336
What?

164
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,296
<i>Simon.
- </i> I didn't say anything!

165
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,211
I told you, Simon.

166
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,674
I was very clear.
- No!

167
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,714
You know what you have to do.
- I don't want to!

168
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,220
You have to.

169
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,563
HE SIGHS

170
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,519
Now I have to take extreme measures.

171
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,480
Whoa, whoa! He has a weapon!
- Simon, take it easy!

172
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,532
Stop him!
SIMON WAILS

173
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,406
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

174
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,486
THEY GRUNT AND GROAN

175
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,446
MARCY: It's OK, it's OK...

176
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,791
Lower him down.

177
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,293
OK... You're OK.

178
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,338
What'd I miss?

179
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,641
Sorry, it's a bitch getting here.

180
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,428
Can we meet at an easier place
next time?

181
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,815
Crazy how small they're getting, right?
- Can I get another one next week?

182
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,284
Next week?

183
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,243
I can try, but... I gotta ask

184
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,162
what are you doing with all this stuff?
- VINCENT: <i>Don't tell him.</i>

185
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,747
What did you just say to me?

186
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,501
I... I said, just, what are you building?

187
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,834
I mean, I just hope it's nothing,
like, illegal.

188
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,551
I'll see what I can find,
but I can't promise anything!

189
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,520
<i>VINCENT: Simon...</i>

190
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,353
<i>Simon... Simon... Simon...</i>

191
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,032

00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:49,894

195
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,038
You need to leave.

196
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,928
Hey.

197
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,430
Marcy said you'd be feeling
better when you woke up

198
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,807
but there's still a few hours
left to go before dawn.

199
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,094
You can relax now, by the way.

200

It's four in the morning.

There, there's a sound...

210
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,899
What sound?
- It's like a, a clicking.

oh.

That's a new interface.

00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,335
It's cleaner.

227
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,077
And it's in colour.

228
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,416
Colour?

00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,580

00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,024
Hi.

245
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:53,942
Hey.

246
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:54,995
Are you OK?

247
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,955
I don't know.

248
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,537
Just tell me what's wrong.
Maybe I can help.

249
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:06,542
Alright, I'll just get right to it.

250
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:12,678
So I've been away and you've been home
and that's totally fine.

251
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,763
Yeah.

252
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,640
And I've been learning all this new stuff

253
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:21,721
and meeting new friends,
having these experiences and...

254
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,394
it feels good, you know?

255
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:31,397
But then I come back home and everything's
the same but it's not.

256
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,032
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

257
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,452
You're breaking up with me.

258
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:39,745
No, I'm not...

259
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:43,187
Am I?

260
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,296
Yeah. You're growing into the woman you're
going to become, and that's exciting.

261
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:50,920
You don't have to leave.

262
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,006
No, for sure, it's just that you told me
it was an emergency

263
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,717
so I kinda dropped
everything I was doing...

264
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,599
Yeah, it's an emergency
for our relationship!

265
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,135
I don't even know what I want right now.

266
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,303
I understand.

267
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:06,481
Just take all the time you need.

268
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,142
You'll make the right decision.

269
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:18,912
PHILIP: <i>Boss?</i>

270
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,495
Go ahead.

271
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,083
You're going to want to see this.

272
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,344
Agent MacLaren.

273
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,173
David, what do you need?

274
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,304
I'm just...
- Yeah, I just had some questions.

275
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,305
They're mostly about Marcy.

276
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,307
Mostly?

277
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:42,352
All.

278
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,770
I'll ride down with you.

279
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,984
I wrote them down...
- Yeah, I can see that.

280
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:56,114
Uh, has Marcy's situation changed at work?

281
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,899
You know I can't talk about our work.

282
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,493
Right, but in general,
is she under more stress?

283
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,529
Maybe she's dealing with
a difficult situation?

284
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,582
Let me...

285
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,750
"Have I noticed a sudden
personality change?"

286
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,378
"Is she giving away
any personal possessions?"

287
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,132
This one here seems to be, like,
that's more of a statement...

288
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,211
What, what is this about?

289
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,802
OK, well, I've had some training in this

290
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,682
and recently, I've witnessed some signs
of self-destructive behaviour.

291
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,372
I'm well aware of what happened
with Marcy, if that's what you're asking.

292
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,557
With the tub and the ice...

293
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,598
I know how that must have looked,
but that wasn't self-destructive -

294
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,515
it was experimental.

295
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,730
Cutting-edge science-
- It was extremely dangerous.

296
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,689
Look, would I have approved? No.

297
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:36,734
Do I understand why she did it?

298
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,031
Yeah, I do.

299
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,161
So should you.

300
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,247
Come on.

301
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,622
We have some new information.

302
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,621
Simon was one of the first Travelers.

303
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,629
004.

304
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,291
His mission was to set up
our communication infrastructure.

305
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,380
So what happened?

306
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,591
Schizophrenia manifests
itself later in life.

307
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,468
He was sent into a compromised host.

308
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,268
How well do you understand the Internet?

309
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,017
I'm... Good with languages.

310
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,858
OK, well, broadly speaking,
there are four layers:

311
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:18,071
Application, transport, Internet,
and physical.

312
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,982
One of the first things
that Simon did when he arrived

313
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,653
was create a whole new physical layer.

314
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,195
A dedicated backbone that piggybacks

315
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,489
off cell phone networks and
communications satellites.

316
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,408
Our back channel in the deep web.

317
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,624
Turns out our back channel
also has layers.

318
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,380
He's watching you.

319
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,461
Vincent's spying on us there, too.

320
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,230
He's using secret layers
in the back channel

321
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:41,548
for secure communication
and to spy on other Travelers.

322
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,213
That's the bad news.

323
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,546
The good news is, now that we know,
we think we can use it

324
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,652
against him to find out where he's hiding.

325
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,813
Show me.

326
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,567
He presented very classically.

327
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:59,946
Persecutory delusions,
fear of authority and surveillance...

328
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,321
The neuroleptics levelled him out

329
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,491
and we've been working on
the other stuff ever since.

330
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,532
He believes he was sent from the future
on a mission to save the Earth.

331
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,950
He literally doesn't think
he's living in his own body.

332
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,627
The art therapy has been
a successful intervention.

333
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,674
As you know, he's a natural talent.

334
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,015
Simon, you have a visitor.

335
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,734
This is the man I was telling you about.

336
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,733
Hello, Simon.

337
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,692
It's a pleasure to meet you.

338
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,377
Dr Carroll...

339
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,832
Would it be possible for me to speak
with Simon alone?

340
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,524
You wouldn't be in any danger,
if that's what you're worried about.

341
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,091
I'd like to talk about his work
and I want him to feel free to open up.

342
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,300
Well, I suppose I could go
grab us some coffees.

343
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,221
Simon, will you be nice to our visitor?

344
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,145
Mr Ingram is a close friend
of the institution.

345
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,402
You're not supposed to be here.

346
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,234
Simon, you heard what Dr Carroll said.

347
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,070
You were supposed to die
in the North Tower.

348
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,916
You know who I am.
- I know that voice.

349
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,961
We searched for it for years.

350
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,964
Then you also know that I'm important
to the program, Simon.

351
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,008
I'm the very first Traveler.

352
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:48,217
The Director is not happy.
You were supposed to die.

353
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,265
Not anymore.

354
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,262
The Director gave me a new mission.

355
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,642
What mission?

356
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,849
The Director feels terrible
for what happened to you

357
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:56,898
and wants to fix it.

358
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,023
It sent me to help you.

359
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,562
We're going to make you whole again, Simon.

360
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,489
There are 16 continental switches

361
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,098
on the back channel but only four
that handle subchannel traffic.

362
00:22:13,374 --> 00:22:16,412
Simon helped me set up alerts
to log any suspicious network activity.

363
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,791
So what are we looking at?

364
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,197
This is Vincent communicating
with somebody late last night.

365
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,255
With who?
- We don't know.

366
00:22:23,361 --> 00:22:24,361
What does it say?

367
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,843
We don't know that either.
- So where's it going?

368
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,719
We don't know where it
was sent or received.

369
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:32,052
Hops are encrypted along the subchannels
as well as both ends of the pipe.

370
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:33,724
Except for this one.

371
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,685
He's getting a call.

372
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,936
Well, grab it.

373
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,848
It looks like the access point is unsecure.

374
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,482
We might be getting a phone number.

375
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,560
PHONE BUZZES
- TAYLOR CHATTERS

376
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,907
This isn't the last phone I sent you.

377
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,785
Those phones are meant for your safety
as well as mine.

378
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,446
<i>DR PERROW:
I can't find that one.</i>

379
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,704
<i>And this won't take long..</i>

380
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:00,077
Vincent, you need a more thorough
treatment regimen -

381
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,413
one that at least allows for
the possibility of medication.

382
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,999
No. I don't need drugs,
I just need to talk.

383
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,463
We have an appointment.
- And I'm calling to cancel it.

384
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,798
That is unacceptable.

385
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:10,882
<i>Vincent, I'm sorry..</i>

386
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:11,973
I can recommend...
- No.

387
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,632
<i>I don't want to talk with anyone else..</i>

388
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,216
I just want to talk with you.

389
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,227
And I will, just as we agreed.
- Goodbye, Vincent.

390
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,137
Please don't contact me again.

391
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,566
PHONE CLICKS

392
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:25,904
Call's over.

393
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,025
We got the originating number.

394
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,398
Good. I've gotta get back to the Bureau.

395
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,783
You track down that location.
Everybody else, Protocol 5.

396
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,708
The minute we find out where Vincent
is hiding, we're going to knock down

397
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:36,893
his fucking door.

398
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,582
Hey, Carly, hold up.

399
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:40,627
What?

400
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,786
I was thinking maybe you could stay.

401
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,548
For?

402
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:46,693
Protection?

403
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:48,674
SIMON CLEARS HIS THROAT
I gotta pee.

404
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,638
I think you got this. Bye, Philip!

405
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,604
Mr Ingram?

406
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,189
Mr Ingram!

407
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,356
I'm so glad I caught you.

408
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,187
I just wanted to thank you

409
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,567
for the personal interest you've taken
in Simon's care.

410
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:11,197
Oh, I'm happy to help.
- But I'd also like to talk to you about

411
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,653
all the equipment you've
been bringing in...

412
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,860
Surplus electronic parts
from my various companies.

413
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,449
Most of it isn't even functional.

414
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:23,744
Still, Simon's convinced it'll help
with his "consciousness" issue.

415
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,332
Is that what he's saying now?

416
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,715
Of course, the problem is we have procedure
to follow.

417
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,547
Safety and compliance,
various approval committees...

418
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,337
I understand. These things are expensive
and take time.

419
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,767
Hopefully, this will address
the first problem.

420
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,558
Perhaps you can help me with the second.

421
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,566
This is very generous.

422
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,619
Not at all.

423
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,654
Charity is a gift you give yourself.

424
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,993
Have a nice weekend, Doctor.

425
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,895
Marcy?

426
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:29,944
In here!

427
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,273
I'm making dinner.

428
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:37,744
Really?

429
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,994
I just... I've never seen you cook before.
- Well, it's dinner, David.

430
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,158
It's not brain surgery.

431
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:52,884
It's pasta.

432
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
Yeah.

433
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,305
How long's this been on?

434
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,884
Not long enough to boil off the water yet.

435
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:03,722
There's definitely still water in there.

436
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,768
I had a late lunch, so there's no rush.

437
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,278
You surprise me every time you do that.

438
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,842
ELEVATOR CHIMES

439
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:49,480
Shit, I'm sorry.

440
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,561
You're avoiding me.

441
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,021
No, I just...

442
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,027
I'm...
- I see it when you look at me.

443
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,947
I remind you of what happened,
and I'm not taking it personally.

444
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,405
But it does convince me that we need this.

445
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,737
Take-out?

446
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,201
This is caponata...

447
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,621
This is moussaka - that's for me...

448
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,708
And this is Mexican, because there are no
Spanish places around here.

449
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,425
Ah...

450
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:20,803
We just sold our house and you have
a ton of vacation saved, so...

451
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:22,890
Palermo...

452
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,559
Santorini...

453
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,141
Barcelona.

454
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,890
You need a break, Grant - we both do.

455
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:32,682
We take off for a couple of months,
spend a ridiculous amount of money

456
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,146
and hit reset on our entire life.

457
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,942
That would be...

458
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,367
incredible.

459
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,529
But you can't imagine leaving work
for that long.

460
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,038
- I know.

461
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,536
Which is why I started thinking
about a different plan.

462
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,705
One that costs just as much and...

463
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,801
will definitely reset
the hell out of everything.

464
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:04,951
Adoption...?

465
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,637
It's too soon to be
diving in, I know, but...

466
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,518
We could at least start talking about it.

467
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,312
It never would have occurred to me.

468
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,943
Meaning what?

469
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,156
Meaning I think it's a good idea.

470
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,132
Carly.

471
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,629
Carly!

472
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,465
What...? What is this?

473
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:49,662
Are you drunk?

474
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,347
Yeah, I mean, I had a couple drinks.

475
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,263
What do you want? You want me
to disrespect my boss on his birthday?

476
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,398
OK, Jeffery's sleeping, and you're drunk.

477
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,855
I'm not dealing with this right now.
HE SCOFFS

478
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,440
Oh, you're not dealing right now?

479
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,030
How long are you going to hang this
over my head, Carly?

480
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,362
Come on, I been good and you know it.

481
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,111
Plus, you were the one
that was sleeping around.

482
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,201
OK. Get out.

483
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,911
I'm not going anywhere.

484
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,291
Don't touch me again, Jeff.

485
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:16,703
Hey, come on. I been good. You owe me.
- Owe you?

486
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:22,375
Am I gonna get some or what?

487
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,427
Never, Jeff.

488
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,461
Not now, not ever.

489
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:29,202
SHE GROANS

490
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:30,226
Stop it.

OK. OK, OK. OK.

493
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,271
SHE PANTS Stay down.

494
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,655
You shouldn't've done that...

495

Stay down!

00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,011
I said, stay down!

513
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,492
Morning.

514
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:11,827
Hi.

515
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,913
Were you watching me sleep?

516
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,616
You should try looking
at yourself some time.

517
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,999
SHE CHUCKLES It's hard not to.

518
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,501
You're ridiculous.

519
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,957
I am ridiculous.

520
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,791
I'm glad you stayed.

521
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,171
Well, this place is much cosier
than the place I've been staying, so.

522
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,800
Are you using me for my duvet?
SHE CHUCKLES

523
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,353
I'm sorry it's taken me so long
to find my way back.

524
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,189
Well, to be fair...

525
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,984
I was kinda playing hard to get.

526
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:55,986
80 help me understand.

527
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:01,454
How could whatever it was you were doing
make things better?

528
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,996
I mean, even if you can't tell me
the top secret details.

529
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,167
Well, for example, do you remember when we
played the "Operation" game

530
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:11,085
and you said you were
a better doctor than me?

531
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,347
Because I do.

532
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,974
You do?
- Mm-hmm.

533
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,101
There's a lot of things that I...

534
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,146
I remember...

535
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,226
Most of which I can't tell you, but...

536
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,849
I can tell you that...

537
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,147
I love you.

538
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,025
You have no idea how happy
that makes me.

539
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,279
Do you remember that you owe me $20?

540
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,831
Oh, uh... I'll go get it.

541
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,867
Oh, no, I'm kidding!
HE LAUGHS

542
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,752
I wonder if that pasta's ready.

543
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,089
Probably.

544
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,134
HE LAUGHS

545
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,970
Hey, look, you survived.

546
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,015
Yeah.

547
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,258
He started seeing Vincent
again in the night

548
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,769
but at least I got him to start
wearing pants.

549
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,893
How about you? How are things at home?

550
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,353
I knew it.

551
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,437
Ow!

552
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,852
That wasn't a random call.

553
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,146
What? I was up, I was bored!

554
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,064
Bullshit.

555
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,982
You knew something was going to happen.

556
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:18,528
How? That's impossible.
- I don't know how, but you knew.

557
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,154
The timing was too perfect.

558
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,415
No, I...
- What was I going to do?

559
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,451
Was I going to go to jail?

560
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:29,663
Was I going to kill him?

561
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,925
How is Jeff?

562
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,682
He'll live.

563
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:40,974
Probably won't even remember it.

564
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:42,847
So what are you going to do?

565
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,430
Hey. You got something?

566
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,234
The phone that called Vincent
was a burner -

567
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,816
paid for in cash, no user info.

568
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,573
But I was able to use its IMEI
along with cell tower data

569
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:58,780
to find the neighbourhood
that it was last used.

570
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,239
TREVOR: Fancy part of town.

571
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,947
Right, which made this next part easier.

572
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,331
Most people who live in this area
are upstanding citizens

573
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,539
who have actual names
attached to their phones.

574
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,874
Narrow the search to nameless devices...

575
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,960
and our list drops close to zero.

576
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,343
Simon and I spent the night checking
security footage at these locations

577
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,299
and came up with our prime suspect...

578
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,554
Katrina Perrow.

579
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,685
Specialises in treating panic disorders,
social anxiety and agoraphobia.

580
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,060
Text me the address.

581
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,187
Carly, you're with me.

582
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,232
Yup.

583
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,900
VINCENT: You've been given
every resource to make this work!

584
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,106
SIMON: We need more time.

585
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,816
We need to be operating at the exascale,
minimum.

586
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,981
The meteor...
- VINCENT: I told you! I told you...

587
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,241
I keep telling you...

588
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,403
The meteor doesn't happen for years.

589
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:45,204
Then we find another way, right?

590
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,708
Look, we've got the node clusters,
the math libraries...

591
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,039
We just need a qubit engine
and a field generator...

592
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,208
Where are we going to get that, Simon?
- The Director!

593
00:34:52,232 --> 00:34:54,874
Oh...! This was a mistake.
- No...

594
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,258
I've wasted so much time...
- No, we just need the plans.

595
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,966
No. We're finished here.
- We've hurt so many people!

596
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,260
We hurt Marcy!

597
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,226
Just ask the Director for the materials!

598
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,097
HE YELLS: Ask the Director!

599
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,470
PHILIP: Why didn't the Director
help him?

600
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,177
Afterwards, I mean?

601
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,686
Why did it abandon him?

602
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,021
Probably for the same reason
it sent my consciousness...

603
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,027
Well, yours, too, for that matter -

604
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,234
into a compromised host.

605
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,317
SHE SIGHS It didn't know.

606
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,779
No records from the institution
made it out of the 21st.

607
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:05,986
Vincent covered his tracks.

608
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,530
SIMON: I want to go home...

609
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:10,959
What's that?

610
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,952
Can I go home now?

611
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:18,503
Can I ask about...?
- No.

612
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,835
Dr Perrow?

613
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,595
I'm Special Agent Grant MacLaren
and this is my associate, Carly Shannon.

614
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,885
We'd like to speak to you
about one of your patients.

615
00:36:32,357 --> 00:36:35,566
The FBI has been monitoring
Vincent Ingram for some time.

616
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,317
We know all about his paranoid delusions

617
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,979
and, unfortunately,
he's starting to act on them.

618
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,523
He's hurt someone?
- Yes, and we believe it will continue.

619
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:46,318
I didn't know. I would have reported it.

620
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:49,159
None of that matters now.
We're just interested in stopping him.

621
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,370
SHE SIGHS
Our professional relationship deteriorated.

622
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,701
I just called him to cancel an appointment.

623
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,917
We're aware of your phone call.
We want you to keep that appointment.

624
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,591
What?

625
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,544
Why?

626
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,958
Ingram is in hiding.

627
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,927
You want me to keep my appointment
and you're going to follow me?

628
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,216
We have a device.

629
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:13,638
It's completely untraceable but it will
allow us to be in constant communication.

630
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,305
You mean like a wire?

631
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,816
Little more high-tech than that.

632
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,522
Will you help us?

633
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,567
I just got out of a board meeting

634
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,903
and they told me that
you are withdrawing funding.

635
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,114
I told them that this must be
some kind of mistake.

636
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,244
It's not a mistake.

637
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,825
At least give us more time.

638
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,457
A more gradual reduction
of funds would allow us to-

639
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,957
I'm sorry, I've made my decision.

640
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,791
The institute has come to rely
on your generosity.

641
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,829
Whole programs will be shuttered.

642
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,794
And what about the patients?

643
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,422
A lot of them will be
put out on the street.

644
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,008
Well, then it's fortunate you care so much

645
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,890
and I've been able to compensate you
so well over the years.

646
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,676
You can take my place as a benefactor.

647
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,947
Alright. This should be enough
to last you for a while.

648
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,246
Give us a call when you need more -
you know how to find us.

649
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,245
I'm glad it worked, Marcy.

650
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,535
Glad what worked?

651
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,665
The device in room 210.

652
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,178
I thought you were gone forever,
but then you got better.

653
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,215
Maybe I can get better, too.

654
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,181
Take care of yourself, OK?

655
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,335
<i>PHILIP: OK, the car's approaching now.</i>

656
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:05,384
<i>Good luck..</i>

657
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,040
Alright, she's leaving the city.

658
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,575
Signal looks good.

659
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,370
TREVOR: Yeah. We see it, too.

660
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,788
Following at a safe distance.

661
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:57,769
COM BEEPS

662
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,807
CARLY: <i>Dr Perrow,
you activated your</i> cam.

663
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,563
<i>Everything alright?
- </i> It's fine.

664
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,269
We're right behind you.

665
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,026
All you need to do is lead us there
and we'll do the rest.

666
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,192
It's a fine day out there.

667
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,746
MACLAREN: There it is.

668
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:01,907
GPS says she's inside.

669
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,419
I was gonna say we need to deactivate
the cameras but I don't see any.

670
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,289
In fact, I don't even think
the barn has any power.

671
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,302
Makes sense if you want to hide
from the Director.

672
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:14,219
Why do these things
always end up in barns?

673
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,947
Philip, you got Perrow's com?

674
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,574
<i>PHILIP: She 's holding position.</i>

675
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,474
<i>'This is a message for
Agent Grant MacLaren..</i>

676
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,186
<i>'I was acting on Agent MacLaren's behalf'</i>

677
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,223
<i>kin an unsanctioned operation..</i>

678
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:52,771
<i>I was found out...</i>

679
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,447
<i>and will be released unharmed...</i>

680
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:00,074
SHE SOBS

681
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,277
<i>k... along with my daughter...</i>

682
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:09,368
<i>'as long as Agent
MacLaren presents himself'</i>

683
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,503
<i>to these coordinates
in the next two hours..</i>

684
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,633
<i>He must come alone and on time...</i>

685
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,921
<i>or I Will never be heard from again.</i>
