00:00:00,034 --> 00:00:01,033
<i>Previously, on</i> Travelers...

2
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,068
<i>Tell me about me.</i>

3
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:04,469
<i>I'm just trying to find
the missing pieces.</i>

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,371
Someone like you does not happen

5
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:07,639
to someone like me.

6
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,742
It could be the early signs
of a placental abruption.

7
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,544
I need a favor.
Yeah. Of course.

8
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:13,612
<i>One that breaks protocol.</i>

9
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,614
<i>Give me one of her folic acid pills.</i>

10
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:16,648
<i>If we're going to swap out</i>

11
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,450
<i>a medication to prevent a miscarriage,</i>

12
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:19,684
<i>it'll need to look identical.</i>

13
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:25,290
<i>Traveler 3326, open memory chain 71985VX</i>

14
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:26,558
and store the following sequence...

15
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,360
biosynthesis of the glycoproteins...

16
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,063
<i>3326...</i>

17
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,301
<i>access memory chain 71985VX...</i>

18
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,538
<i>Write it down.</i>

19
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:13,605
That's all of it?

20
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,442
Philip?

21
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,476
Is that all of it?

22
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,778
Is it error-free?

23
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,514
Yes.

24
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,415
Is it good?

25
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,518
It's great. Can you move?

26
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,327
How did you get in?

27
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,896
Little girl named Chloe.

28
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,130
I said I would send it to you.

29
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,131
Yeah, well, something like this,

30
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,000
I have to see for myself.

31
00:01:42,036 --> 00:01:44,336
Those stereoisomers are going
to be difficult to reproduce.

32
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,338
We're gonna have to do it in batches.

33
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,674
We're leaving.

34
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,876
Sure. Good work, Philip.

35
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,728
Ohh... Oh. God.

36
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:13,665
What did we do last night?

37
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,934
We were going to your place.

38
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:18,836
We did.

39
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,072
We did?

40
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,377
This is disturbing.

41
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,879
You hit the drops pretty hard.

42
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:30,815
Mm...

43
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,018
It's never felt like this before.

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,886
It'll pass.

45
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,656
We need to talk.

46
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,391
This has to end.

47
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:41,626
What?

48
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,960
This.

49
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,195
Us.

50
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,332
What?

51
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,802
I got a new mission.

52
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,737
What mission?

53
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,072
Sorry, Philip.

54
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,607
Lightning struck.

55
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,276
So "goodbye"?

56
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,946
We never see each other again?

57
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,250
I... I thought we had a connection.

58
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,417
Right.

59
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:09,154
I am your connection.

60
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,622
That's not what I meant.

61
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,725
That should last you a few months,

62
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,761
if you use 'em
the way you're supposed to.

63
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,368
Jenny.

64
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,136
Jenny!

65
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:47,659
Okay. It's almost over.

66
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,261
Okay.
It's 100.6.

67
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:52,830
It's high, but manageable.

68
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,766
I know, I know, I know, I know.

69
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,135
So, um...

70
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,105
alternate between these two...
acetaminophen and ibuprofen.

71
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,408
It should manage his fever
or whatever pain he might be in.

72
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,443
That's it?

73
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,477
That's it.

74
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,145
He should be fine in a few days.

75
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,649
You hear that, baby?

76
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:14,185
Auntie Marcy says
you're gonna be all right.

77
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,486
Ahh.

78
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,221
Stay for coffee?

79
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:18,489
Sure.

80
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:19,490
Okay.

81
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,127
So I'll put him down.

82
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,690
Philip.

83
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,594
You've been quiet lately.

84
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,330
Yeah, not much to say.

85
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,132
Well, some people

86
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,400
find talking about it to be therapeutic.

87
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,903
It has been two weeks.

88
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:08,906
You know that doesn't make
a difference for me, right?

89
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,209
I remember every detail
as if it just happened.

90
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,545
Okay, good chat. Ahem.

91
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,515
Who is it?

92
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,484
0115.

93
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,619
3326.

94
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,555
We were given orders to meet you.

95
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,823
You must be Graham.

96
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:28,226
Yeah. Come on in.

97
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,131
You boys hungry? I got soup on.

98
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,165
No, thank you.

99
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,033
Smells delicious.

100
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:37,134
You have a lovely home.

101
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,669
It's just temporary.

102
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,104
Driving up and down the state,

103
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,138
making hand-offs.

104
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:42,173
A long mission.

105
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,976
Well,
roll out's been longer than expected,

106
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:46,910
but I ain't complaining.

107
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,112
I got to see three eagles!

108
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:50,948
Hopefully you're done soon.

109
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:53,250
Yeah, well,
your team's one of the last on the list.

110
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,388
Excuse me.

111
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,757
Here you go.

112
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,734
What a lovely couple.

113
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,740
Thank you for coming
and checking him out.

114
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,642
I know I probably sounded crazy.

115
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:20,344
No, you don't sound crazy.

116
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,947
You had a natural maternal instinct.

117
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,951
I don't know about natural.

118
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,219
It's not like I'm really his mother.

119
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,821
Yeah, you are.

120
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,957
In every way that means something.

121
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,259
You guys have bonded.

122
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,629
Who would've thought that would
happen to somebody like me?

123
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,198
You mean a soldier?

124
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,867
Maybe you've changed.

125
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,903
Maybe we all have.

126
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,104
I mean, I have to believe

127
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,441
that we are more than
just our consciousness.

128
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:53,011
At least, the one we came here with.

129
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,946
Maybe that's...

130
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,681
Maybe that's the better part of us.

131
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,616
It's funny,
you said something like that,

132
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,319
the night that you, uh...

133
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,420
Um...

134
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:04,989
What?

135
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:08,926
The night that I was reset?

136
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,462
What did I say?

137
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,965
Mac didn't tell you?

138
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,268
Well, he said that it was
the only way to save my life.

139
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:18,936
It was.

140
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:21,004
So?

141
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,408
I really didn't have any choice then.

142
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,544
You thought you did.

143
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,614
What... What does that mean?

144
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,551
I shouldn't have said anything.

145
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,620
No, Carly.

146
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,491
We just didn't know
it was gonna happen so fast.

147
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:44,094
Are you saying that
it happened against my will?

148
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,331
I don't know.

149
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,800
We thought you had more time.

150
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:51,001
So did you.

151
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,870
You said you wanted to go home,

152
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:56,807
because you wanted to think about it.

153
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:59,977
What could there possibly be
to think about?

154
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,479
I mean, I'd be dead.

155
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:05,282
I know, that's what I said at the time.

156
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,685
Now I'm beginning to understand.

157
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,031
This is exactly how
it happened last time.

158
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,569
Kat...
you've been taking your medication,

159
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,337
you've done everything by the book.

160
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,371
It's gonna be all right.

161
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,173
Ohh, stop saying that.

162
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:33,777
Hi. Apologies.

163
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,679
The, uh, the printer was down.

164
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,116
How are we?

165
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,452
Ahem.

166
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:44,688
Kathryn, the, uh, latest ultrasound,

167
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,390
it looks good.

168
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,425
It looks really good.

169
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,259
The dark spot's completely gone,

170
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,295
which means that it was probably nothing

171
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,931
or maybe just a mistake with the scan.

172
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,601
You and the baby are fine.

173
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,839
I'm sorry...

174
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,609
Thank you.

175
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:06,644
You're welcome.

176
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,778
Now, I want you to stick

177
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,047
to the calcium-rich foods,
the folic acid, and...

178
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,082
'Kay.

179
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,450
I'll see you in a few weeks.

180
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:13,484
Okay.

181
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,552
Thanks.

182
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,154
'Kay.

183
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,624
Thank you.

184
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,635
Hoo...

185
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,175
What was in the package?

186
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:40,010
An antiviral.

187
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,078
Historically,

188
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,813
this is the beginning
of a minor flu outbreak

189
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,949
that kills 70,000 people worldwide.

190
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,316
That does not sound "minor" to me.

191
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,384
Percentage-wise.

192
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,153
We're not wired to think
in "billions" of people.

193
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,055
Over a few months, an antigenic shift

194
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,956
allows the virus to mutate,

195
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:54,625
infecting more of the population.

196
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,695
Eventually, the C.D.C.
and W.H.O. get it under control.

197
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,465
Must be why they provided
a broad-spectrum antiviral.

198
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,632
This will inhibit

199
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,801
the development
of each of its mutations.

200
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,769
Our mission is to save
three of the people

201
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,304
who, historically, don't make it.

202
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:09,206
Are there any more?

203
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,108
Jeffrey's already been
through the worst of it.

204
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,177
You need to protect yourself.

205
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,813
Couldn't we have
gotten the pill version?

206
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,514
These are the host candidates?

207
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,183
Jordan Lam, Annie Kapoor,

208
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,952
and Brittney Palmer.

209
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,821
Personal trainer, a flight attendant,

210
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,622
a travel blogger.

211
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,524
Prime hosts that must
have spread the virus.

212
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,993
Well,
let's make sure that doesn't happen.

213
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:03,460
Are you gonna do the whole class?

214
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,632
Just waiting for the right opportunity.

215
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:10,635
Hi, Brittney.

216
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,169
I'll be doing your vaccinations today.

217
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,673
Okay.
You can take a seat.

218
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:13,296
That's it.

219
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,632
Have fun in Europe.

220
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,300
Thanks.

221
00:12:23,009 --> 00:12:25,109
Mein Asthma.

222
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,636
Oh!

223
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,205
God. I was stung by a freakin' bee.

224
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,907
Me too. I think.

225
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,309
Are you allergic?

226
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,944
No. I'm not.

227
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,746
Good.

228
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,789
<i>...As reports are increasing</i>

238
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,584
We need to talk.

239
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,885
Hello, Miss Day.

240
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,887
When's the last time
you heard from the Director?

241
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,422
The school board director?

242
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,456
What are you talking about?

243
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,791
Hey, you're worried about them?

244
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,626
Please!
There's literally nothing going on

245
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:50,961
inside their tiny brains.

246
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,496
The girls are thinking about
their insipid friendships

247
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,533
and the boys are imagining them naked.

248
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,334
What do you want?

249
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,435
Have you heard

250
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,970
from the Director?

251
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,006
We've had missions.

252
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,309
Well, why haven't I heard anything?

253
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,543
I don't know. Maybe because

254
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:08,079
you jumped here without permission?

255
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,046
Or maybe because you don't have a team?

256
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:11,314
Maybe I can join your team.

257
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,983
I could be your computer expert.

258
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,251
Nah, we already have a computer expert.

259
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,886
I could be your vastly-more-capable

260
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:16,921
computer expert.

261
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:17,955
Doesn't work like that.

262
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,890
Well, it should! I'm getting bored!

263
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:23,260
You gonna finish that?

264
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,900
Mm! Fake chicken.

265
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,407
Mm!

266
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,277
Hey have you seen my,
uh, my work jacket?

267
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,679
You were supposed to take Jeffrey today.

268
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,849
I know that, but I just got called in.

269
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,882
There's this big bug going around.

270
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,651
So?

271
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,187
So I'm going to work.

272
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,491
What'd I say?

273
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,961
It's what you didn't say.

274
00:14:58,497 --> 00:14:59,929
"Hey, Carly.

275
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,032
"I know I was supposed
to take Jeffrey today,

276
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,167
but something came up. Can you help?"

277
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,303
Well, why do I have to say all of that?

278
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,671
You're his mother.

279
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,473
And you're his father.

280
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:11,808
We said we were
going to do this together.

281
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:13,344
Equal partners, remember?

282
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,316
Carly Shannon,

283
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,619
would you please help me out

284
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,221
by taking our gorgeous son
to the babysitter's house

285
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,422
so that I can go to work

286
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:28,325
as an underpaid,
underappreciated, beat cop

287
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,960
one more day?

288
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,465
Fine,

289
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,401
but you're doing pick-ups
for the rest of the week.

290
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,236
Absolutely.

291
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,472
And your jacket's
on the hook by the door.

292
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:43,841
Thank you.

293
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,510
See you, little man.

294
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,079
I'll see you, uh, see you tonight.

295
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,885
Hey. You want your ducky?

296
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,355
Yeah, you do.

297
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,357
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

298
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,893
Oh? Where are you taking him?

299
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,719
Hello?

300
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,454
<i>3185. Has your team taken the antiviral?</i>

301
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,788

Hi, David. Um, it's me, Marcy.

306
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,454
Just wondering

307
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,989
if you wanted to maybe
get together to talk.

308
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,491
<i>Marcy, you there?</i>

309
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:46,362
Uh, so, if you'd like to,
just give me a call back.

310
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,464
Okay. Bye.

311
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,665
<i>Marcy?</i>

312
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,170
Yeah, Philip, go ahead.

<i>We need you at Ops.</i>

314
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,774
<i>Boyd showed up
with one of her teammates.</i>

315
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,409
What's happening?

316
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,510
<i>I don't know.</i>

317
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,711
<i>She said it's some kind
of viral infection.</i>

318
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,279
<i>There's growing concern</i>

319
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,948
<i>for an outbreak of a new flu strain</i>

<i>that has infected a number

<i>While much is still unknown

322
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,688
Hey, Sarge.

323
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,124
I never got my assignment.

324
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,459
Connicker, what are you doing here?

325
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,559
I'm filling in.

326
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,961
Yeah, right.

327
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,530
This flu is kicking us around.
You get your shot yet?

328
00:18:20,565 --> 00:18:21,664
No. Not yet.

329
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,732
Well, you better get on it.

330
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,201
You covering McAllister or Boyd?

331
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:26,336
McAllister.

332
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,672
Hospital.

333
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,148
<i>Top authorities are expressing concern</i>

334
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,583
<i>over the intensity of the symptoms</i>

335
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,319
<i>and the speed in which the virs
seems to be spreading.</i>

336
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,054
So it presents like classic flu...

337
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,888
fever, sore throat, headache.

338
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,057
Yeah, but it's not the flu.

339
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:48,158
He received

340
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:49,926
the same broad-spectrum
antiviral we all did.

341
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,695
Okay, a virus that's not the flu...

342
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,263
Um...

343
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,865
Meningitis? West Nile?

344
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,100
I checked those.

345
00:18:57,135 --> 00:18:58,402
I checked them all, actually.

346
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,236
There's no match.

347
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,738
Well...

348
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:06,509
Okay, well, if it's a virus,
we can identify which one it is.

349
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,011
I've checked every gene sequence

350
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,413
for every virus in the 21st

351
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,281
and every century after that.

352
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:14,050
Are you saying that it's a new pathogen?

353
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,386
Yeah. Unknown in this time or in ours.

354
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:17,453
How is that even possible?

355
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,940
"O, my love, my wife!"

356
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:39,776
"Death...

357
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,711
"Death sucked the honey of thy breath,

358
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,215
have no power yet upon thy beauty."

359
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:47,851
Seriously, you guys?

360
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,620
How old are you?

361
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,788
Go ahead, Trevor.

362
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:55,225
"...Upon thy beauty.

363
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,427
"Thou art not conquered.

364
00:19:57,463 --> 00:19:58,628
"Beauty's ensign yet

365
00:19:58,663 --> 00:20:01,298
"is crimson in thy lips
and in thy cheeks,

366
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,099
and death's pale flag..."

367
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:05,435
<i>Trevor? You there?</i>

368
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,738
Aye.

369
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:09,939
Good. Okay, okay.

370
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:10,974
<i>Take it from, um...</i>

371
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,008
You in class?

372
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,143
Mm-hmm.

373
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,712
"Dear Juliet, Why art thou yet so fair?"

374
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:16,947
<i>Okay, you need to leave.</i>

375
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,748
<i>You might be infected
with a dangerous pathogen.</i>

376
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:19,750
Keep your distance

377
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,251
from other people and get outside.

378
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,753
What's happening?
<i>Just go now.</i>

379
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,788
We're skipping to the last section.

380
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,824
One final embrace,
one last kiss, and then...

381
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:29,459
<i>Go, now. MacLaren's waiting for you.</i>

382
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:31,028
I got to go.

383
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,495
You don't have to kiss, just read.

384
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,498
Don't! Don't touch me!

385
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,534
I'm sorry... I got to go.

386
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,878
Hardly even looks like a virus.

387
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,579
No, you kind of expect something

388
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,248
pleomorphic.

389
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:53,483
Spherical capsid... radial symmetry.

390
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,285
That's what's infected us?

391
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,688
That's what we're trying to determine.

392
00:20:58,723 --> 00:21:01,491
Oh, good! I need blood from both of you.

393
00:21:01,527 --> 00:21:02,625
What do you call it?

394
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,394
Mm. We haven't got that far yet.

395
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,496
Boyd's viral count

396
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,830
is up in the hundreds of thousand,

397
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,865
her teammate's up over a million.

398
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,533
Here. Seems to be tied

399
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,535
to the antiviral mission somehow.

400
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,270
We got it two weeks before you did.

401
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,440
Heath's immune system
was already compromised.

402
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,075
I had to remove one of his lungs

403
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,243
after a mission blew up
near the beginning.

404
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,446
His antibodies
are showing no cross-reactivity,

405
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,814
his body just keeps amplifying it.

406
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:25,582
So how do we get it under control?

407
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:28,318
Heath!

408
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,920
Little help?
Guys!

409
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,055
We need to sedate him!

410
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,823
Keep holding him down!

411
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,365
I can't get a BP.

412
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,832
There's no pulse.

413
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:45,002
One, two... three, four...

414
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,637
five, six, seven,

415
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:48,939
eight, nine, ten.

416
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,274
11, 12, 13, 14,

417
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,509
15, 16, 17, 18, 19...

418
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,078
Stop CPR.

419
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,250
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

420
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,285
eight, nine, ten.

421
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,087
One, two, three, four...
He's gone. Marcy.

422
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,288
Five, six...
Marcy!

423
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,457
He's gone.

424
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:27,077
I'm sorry.

425
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,113
Come on.

426
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,515
Let's get you off your feet.

427
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,250
You need some rest.

428
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:36,286
I think it's a little late for that.

429
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:47,030
So...

430
00:22:47,065 --> 00:22:49,066
how's it looking?

431
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,870
We're all infected, aren't we?

432
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,242
Not all.

433
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,612
You, Philip, and Carly have it.

434
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:05,449
You and I somehow rejected the virus.

435
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,716
What?

436
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,984
Each of your blood samples

437
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,954
has a viral load between 500
and 1,000 copies per milliliter.

438
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,322
Ours is zero.

439
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,757
What about antibodies?

440
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:14,758
Trace amounts.

441
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,792
Somehow, we're immune.

442
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,260
How is that possible?

443
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,362
It's hard to say,
without running more tests.

444
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,932
So, if we're immune,
can't you create a blood serum?

445
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,534
We'll try,
but we might be running out of time.

446
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,701
If this started with the mission,

447
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,770
we can't be the only ones.

448
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,904
Check the deep web

449
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,539
for any other teams
reporting the same symptoms.

450
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,974
If it's transmitted

451
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,076
through air particles and fomites,

452
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,277
that means there's a good chance

453
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,813
you've infected everyone
you've come into contact with.

454
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,481
Are you sure?

455
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:40,483
Outside of an immunity,

456
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:41,617
we're predicting an infection rate

457
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,152
of over 40%.

458
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,321
40?

459
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,089
Call everyone
you've come into contact with.

460
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:47,657
Tell them to stay inside.

461
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:50,326
Boss, you're gonna want to see this.

462
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,794
Traveler teams from around the world

463
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,263
are reporting the same sickness.

464
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,234
They've been
transmitting it this whole time.

465
00:23:58,269 --> 00:23:59,969
If I get you more of the antiviral,

466
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,137
can you analyze it?

467
00:24:01,172 --> 00:24:02,639
See what went wrong?

468
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,141
Possibly,
but I'm running low on ethidium bromide.

469
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:06,475
It's a controlled substance,

470
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,411
it's not something you can get
on short notice.

471
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,478
What about your hospital?

472
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,314
Yeah, the lab should have some.

473
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,515
I'll text you a name.

474
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:16,586
You two, track down the team
that handed off the vials,

475
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,653
I'll go to the hospital.

476
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,523
I've got to get my son
from the babysitter's.

477
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,424
Carly! You're infected.

478
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,327
The best thing that you can do
for Jeffrey right now

479
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,595
is stay away.

480
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,140
<i>Hi, David. Um, it's me, Marcy.</i>

481
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,308
<i>I was just wondering</i>

482
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,243
<i>if you wanted to maybe
get together to talk.</i>

483
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:44,114
<i>Uh, so, if you'd like to,
just give me a call back.</i>

484
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,314
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

485
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,324
David?

486
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,426
<i>Marce! Hey!
Sorry, I just got your message.</i>

487
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:57,727
I was out riding.

488
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,228
Uh, I'd love to meet up.

489
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,797
<i>Um, where are you right now?</i>

490
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,798
I'm at home.

491
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,999
<i>Okay, don't leave.</i>

492
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,167
You coming over?

493
00:25:04,203 --> 00:25:06,135
No, David. Uh...

494
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,106
A dangerous flu is spreading.

495
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,408
Like SARS?

496
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,042
<i>Worse than that.</i>

497
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,910
W...

498
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,079
Wait. What-what? Where are you?

499
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:18,481
I'm-I'm safe. Just...

500
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,416
Why do I get more worried
every time you say that?

501
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,019
David,
you don't need to worry about me, okay?

502
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:25,889
Well, I do, I worry about you.

503
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:28,992
And I worry about my clients,
most of whom...

504
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,760
don't have a home to stay inside of.

505
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:31,895
<i>David...</i>

506
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:32,995
Just stay home.

507
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,564
I've seen how bad this can get.

508
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,598
Marce, I'm sorry.

509
00:25:35,634 --> 00:25:37,400
Thank you for telling me,
but I've got to go.

510
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,035
<i>David!</i>

511
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,680
<i>...And reporting
a wide range of symptoms,</i>

512
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,681
<i>from common flu ailments,</i>

513
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,749
<i>like headache, fatigue, and fever,</i>

514
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,286
<i>to, in rare cases,
more extreme symptoms,</i>

515
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:59,289
<i>including redness
and bleeding around the eyes.</i>

516
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,389
<i>At this point,</i>

517
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,391
<i>health authorities
are advising the public</i>

518
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,460
<i>to stay home if they don't feel...</i>

519
00:26:07,466 --> 00:26:08,598
Where are you headed?

520
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:09,599
Home.

521
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:10,901
When you get there, stay there.

522
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,468
There seems to be
a bad flu going around.

523
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:14,237
And tell everyone you know, all right?

524
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,538
Sure thing.

525
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:25,982
<i>...Officials have been able to determine</i>

526
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,251
<i>that despite being referred to
by most as "the flu,"</i>

527
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,421
<i>this is not actually
a new strain of influenza</i>

528
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:33,890
<i>but rather a new virus completely.</i>

529
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,791
<i>The origins of the virus...</i>

530
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,434
Mac, where are you?

531
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,802
It's all-hands over here.

532
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:46,970
<i>I know, listen.</i>

533
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,438
Did you receive an antiviral
in the last two weeks?

534
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,174
Yeah, I had to save some hosts.

535
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,576
Any of your team sick?

536
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,478
Yeah. Three of us. Why?

537
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:56,980
<i>We've seen Traveler reports</i>

538
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,281
<i>this is happening all over the world,</i>

539
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,316
and I think
we are the primary transmitters.

540
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,317
Shit!

541
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,418
<i>I have my team tracking down</i>

542
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,420
the antiviral, to run some tests.

543
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,255
<i>All right, well,
let me know how it goes.</i>

544
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,224
In the meantime,
the CDC's setting up shelters,

545
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,625
Wakefield wants us

546
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:11,194
<i>to meet up with the National Guard.</i>

547
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,695
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>

548
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,730
Look, I'm on my way to the hospital.

549
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:15,131
I'll have to meet you in 30.

550
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,134
All right.

551
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,859
Graham?

552
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,599
Graham! It's Trevor.

553
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,846
I'll go check the back.

554
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,248
Sure.

555
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,983
Hi. Sorry.
Can you tell me who's in charge here?

556
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,017
What do you need?

557
00:29:14,052 --> 00:29:16,986
He's got a bad fever, a headache.

558
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,521
He needs to see a doctor.

559
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:19,822
Well, he's not gonna get one here.

560
00:29:19,857 --> 00:29:22,424
The E.R.'s been in overflow for an hour,

561
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,294
and people with the flu
are being sent home.

562
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,461
He'll be better off at home.

563
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:28,031
Excuse me. Excuse me.

564
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:31,434
Nurse, he doesn't have a home.

565
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,702
Well, he's better off anywhere but here.

566
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,870
You his family?

567
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,138
Case worker.

568
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,440
How many people
are you caring for right now?

569
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:38,942
Uh...

570
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,710
Officially or unofficially?

571
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,647
Wait here.

572
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,353
Oh. Here. Um...

573
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,487
It's not much,

574
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:52,821
but it's better than nothing.

575
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,823
Thank you.

576
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,224
Yeah. Be sure to keep one for yourself.

577
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:56,459
Thank you, that's very kind.

578
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,328
Take care!

579
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,867
Agent MacLaren!

580
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:05,901
David.

581
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:07,303
Is Marcy here?

582
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,370
No.

583
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,839
Maybe you could pass
along a message for me?

584
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,073
Could you ask her

585
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,642
to come by the shelter a little later?

586
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:13,809
These guys are in rough shape.

587
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,078
I'll pass it along,

588
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,979
but her hands are pretty full right now.

589
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:18,414
Yeah, I bet.

590
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,316
Excuse me! Why are you taking her?

591
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:21,317
We were here first!

592
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:22,752
I'm not taking anyone, sir, relax.

593
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,221
We've got a kid here!

594
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,424
How bad is it?

595
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,862
Okay. I'll let you get to it, then.

596
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,164
Remember to ask Marcy...

597
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,700
I will. Good luck.

598
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,936
Yeah, you too.

599
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:52,682
Pupils are sluggish.

600
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,417
Intracranial pressure?

601
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,684
I mean, that would explain

602
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,586
the headaches and the seizures.

603
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:58,687
We could try mannitol,

604
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,557
or skip straight to a cerebral shunt.

605
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,124
Great.

606
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,760
Isn't that your specialty?

607
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,094
Funny.

608
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:07,463
We got company.

609
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,464
<i>Let me in!</i>

610
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,399
I can't, we're sick.

611
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,268
<i>So am I! Let me in!</i>

612
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,509
One of those teenage
petri dishes got me sick.

613
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,214
What's all this?

614
00:31:25,249 --> 00:31:26,782
We got a mission to save people

615
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,284
who were gonna die from the flu,

616
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,253
but the Director's
antiviral didn't work.

617
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,588
That's impossible.

618
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:37,594
There's also an outbreak
in Shanghai and Berlin.

619
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,965
<i>Hey, Mac, you there?</i>

620
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,366
Go ahead.

621
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,036
We found the delivery team,
but no antiviral.

622
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,338
The supply was cleared out

623
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:50,406
and the team had been assassinated.

624
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,741
What?

625
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:54,577
<i>There was no sign
of struggle or forced entry.</i>

626
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,445
Wh... Are you thinking inside job?

627
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,414
It wouldn't be the first time
a team turned on each other.

628
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:00,216
Right?

629
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,185
None of this makes any sense.

630
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,889
Okay. I'll see you back at Ops.

631
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,865
She doesn't look good.

632
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,702
Not helpful.

633
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,871
Hold this above her head.

634
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,005
None of this matters

635
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,340
in the long run.

636
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,808
The Director will fix it!

637
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,111
Didn't fix him.

638
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,383
Traveler incoming.

639
00:32:38,989 --> 00:32:40,156
Ah! Told ya!

640
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,290
Here comes the cavalry.

641
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,526
It's good to see you. We need help.

642
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:44,661
Everyone does.

643
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,295
All right, let's have the cure.
We can chat later.

644
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,064
There is no cure.
What?

645
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,232
Of course there is.
We're from the future.

646
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,434
Several teams are working on a viricide,

647
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,535
but so far without success.

648
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,904
I'm here to talk to Philip.

649
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,006
I want to go over the antiviral
data one more time.

650
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,341
Maybe we made a mistake.

651
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,144
I don't know what you're talking about.

652
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:03,379
The formula you wrote on the wall.

653
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:04,380
It allowed us

654
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,981
to synthesize the antiviral.

655
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:08,251
It's right here, look.

656
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,189
I remember this...

657
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,158
but I don't remember writing it down.

658
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,827
How do you not remember?
That's impossible.

659
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,662
When did this happen?

660
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,730
About two weeks ago.

661
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,365
You were with 4514.

662
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,466
Jenny.

663
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,500
What?

664
00:33:24,536 --> 00:33:25,968
I had a headache

665
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,037
and she told me it was from the drops.

666
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,039
She must have given you
a memory inhibitor.

667
00:33:31,142 --> 00:33:32,341
Oh, God.

668
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:34,043
Please tell me what is going on.

669
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,178
Just go get her!

670
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,818
Hello?

671
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,086
<i>Hey. It's me.</i>

672
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,720
What's happening? Are you all right?

673
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:46,622
Grant, have you seen the news?

674
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,025
<i>No. I-I haven't.
Are you sure you're okay?</i>

675
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,026
Yeah, just feeling a bit...

676
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,296
shaky, I don't know.

677
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:56,198
Probably just the news making me crazy.

678
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,633
Can you come home?

679
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,769
Not... Not yet.
Look, just lie down, Kat.

680
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:01,804
And stay inside! Okay?

681
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,539
<i>Okay. What about you?</i>

682
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:04,573
<i>Are you gonna be all ri...</i>

683
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,608
Well, look at this.

684
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:06,609
<i>Grant?</i>

685
00:34:06,644 --> 00:34:09,144
I gotta go.
I just... uh, I'll call you soon.

686
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,080
Come to get a look at
some real police work?

687
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:12,481
Carly's worried about your son.

688
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:14,083
You need to pick him up and go home.

689
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,184
You running errands for her now?

690
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,886
I thought that shit
was over between you.

691
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,654
It was never what you thought it was.

692
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,655
And, right now,

693
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,156
this is about something
bigger than that.

694
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:24,594
You need to pick up your son,
Jeff, and go home.

695
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,397
[radio crackling indistinctly

696
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:34,037
<i>Hey, it's Marcy.
We need you back at Ops.</i>

697
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,238
We know the source of the antiviral.

698
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,841
<i>A Traveler named Jenny.
Philip knows her.</i>

699
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,144
I'm on my way.

700
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,491
Mac, it's been over an hour.

701
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:56,759
What are you doing here?

702
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,494
We're late.
We gotta meet with the National Guard.

703
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,362
You'll have to do it without me.

704
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,830
We need you.

705
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,866
My team comes first.

706
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:21,184
Jenny!

707
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:24,187
Chloe!

708
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,355
Jenny!

709
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:27,956
Jenny?

710
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,229
Oh, no... no, no, no, no, no.

711
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,131
No, no. Jenny. Hey, hey.

712
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,967
Hey! Hey.

713
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,604
No. No, no. No. No.

714
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:51,180
Are you sure about this?

715
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:53,516
Do I have any other choice?

716
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:57,619
All right.

717
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,589
Her vitals are good.

718
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,655
She's stable.

719
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,825
Okay.

720
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,445
Carly?

721
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,386
Shit.

722
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,323
Shh. It's okay. I got you.

723
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:10,460
I got you, I got you. It's okay.

724
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,128
It's okay. It's okay.

725
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,201
Shh-shh-shh. It's okay.

726
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,570
It's okay. It's okay.

727
00:37:36,521 --> 00:37:37,953
You know, when I was a kid,

728
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,988
my mom would make me chicken soup

729
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,223
when I was sick.

730
00:37:41,258 --> 00:37:44,894
Not exactly sure
why it was always chicken soup.

731
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,561
Vera!

732
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,364
Hey, I was trying to reach you.

733
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,532
I said no doctors!

734
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,400
Okay. No, no...
Don't touch me.

735
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,035
No. It's David. See?

736
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,636
Hi!

737
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:56,238
You okay?

738
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:57,240
Yeah.

739
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,274
All right. You got something to eat?

740
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,308
Yeah.
Okay.

741
00:37:59,344 --> 00:38:01,344
I'll be around if you need me. Okay?

742
00:38:08,118 --> 00:38:09,651
It's okay, big man.

743
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:11,153
We're gonna get through this.

744
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,690
We're gonna be fine.

745
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:15,691
You're a fighter.

746
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,192
Just like Mama.

747
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,562
Just like Daddy.

748
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,164
It's okay.

749
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,600
It's okay. It's okay.

750
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:36,245
Hey.

751
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,379
I sense that doctor you sent me to

752
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:39,248
likes you a lot.

753
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,249
Where's...

754
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,550
what's-her-name, Jenny?

755
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,918
They should be back any minute.

756
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,086
Philip knows her how?

757
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,123
Ah. Okay. So what's this?

758
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:49,425
I'm trying to determine

759
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,694
the pathogen's reproduction number,

760
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:54,763
based on hospital databases,
social media updates...

761
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,600
Here. Let me show you something.

762
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,606
An "r-nought" indicates

763
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:05,874
how infectious a virus is

764
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,177
by determining the rate
of secondary infection.

765
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,545
If it's less than one,

766
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,214
the virus will quickly die out.

767
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:14,517
If it's greater than one...

768
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,186
We have an epidemic.

769
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,454
So what are we dealing with?

770
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:19,721
Let's put it into perspective...

771
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:22,592
Influenza has an r-nought of one...

772
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,229
With an incubation period of two days.

773
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,598
Chances are you'd infect
one person in a day,

774
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,835
then they'd go on to infect one more,
and so on.

775
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,338
This virus has an r-nought
of at least two,

776
00:39:36,373 --> 00:39:38,741
with an incubation period...

777
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,210
of 10 days.

778
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:42,444
14 days ago,

779
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,947
10 traveler teams across the world

780
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:47,249
transmitted the virus.

781
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,385
So that is...

782
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:55,524
Potentially

783
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,694
150 people on day one...

784
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,796
330...

785
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:02,864
on day two.

786
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,866
I don't like where this is going.

787
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,169
So, based on the data I pulled

788
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,371
from people already reporting symptoms,

789
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,975
and factoring in
the exponential growth rate...

790
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:19,214
Over 4 million people

791
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:21,149
are currently infected.

792
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,984
Tomorrow, it'll be almost 10.

793
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,620
Most of them aren't
showing symptoms yet,

794
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:25,788
but they will soon.

795
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,789
So how long before
the death rate starts to climb?

796
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:28,991
A couple of days.

797
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,327
I need some help out here!

798
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,831
Clear off that table.

799
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:41,170
Marcy, I don't know if she's breathing.

800
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:43,572
She took pills.

801
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,441
Get her up here.

802
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:49,845
I got a weak pulse!

803
00:40:49,881 --> 00:40:51,180
What'd she take?

804
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,215
Oxycodone.

805
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,052
Hey. Hey, hey, Jenny.

806
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,553
I'm here. I'm here.

807
00:40:58,589 --> 00:40:59,654
You're at Ops. You're safe.

808
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:01,390
You're safe.

809
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,958
You overdosed. I found you in your room.

810
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,894
Hey! Listen to me. Listen to me.

811
00:41:05,929 --> 00:41:08,230
The mission is in trouble.

812
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:09,365
No, Philip.

813
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,468
The mission went exactly as planned.

814
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,504
What?

815
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,039
What do you know?

816
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,941
It won't change anything.

817
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,108
What did you make me do?

818
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,614
My team...

819
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:28,717
they tried to record messengers...

820
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,223
but any incoming signal
caused static on our devices.

821
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,559
We needed a historian.

822
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,130
And someone to synthesize the catalyst.

823
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,232
No.

824
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,800
I was directed to create an antiviral.

825
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,869
Actually,

826
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,304
you were directed

827
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,105
to expedite genetic recombination

828
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,307
of the historical pathogen.

829
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:53,976
You created the new virus.

830
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,145
No, no, no. She's delirious.

831
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,479
The Director would never
order that mission.

832
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,616
Who said the mission
came from the Director?

833
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,786
<i>The future I left</i>

834
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:05,887
<i>was divided</i>

835
00:42:05,923 --> 00:42:08,224
<i>between those loyal to the Director</i>

836
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,492
<i>and the Faction.</i>

837
00:42:10,527 --> 00:42:12,228
<i>Both sides fighting for control,</i>

838
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,430
<i>back and forth.</i>

839
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,400
When you reset the Director,

840
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,069
we lost the ability to access the 21st.

841
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:23,538
We lost the past, we lost everything.

842
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,740
We had no choice
but to shut down the reactor.

843
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,543
We've had missions.

844
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:28,811
Received messengers.

845
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,680
And that's all. Only messengers.

846
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,983
Without the Director's processing power,

847
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:37,419
consciousness transfer isn't possible.

848
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,922
So...

849
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:42,090
before power was cut to the Director,

850
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,526
in our last moment of control,

851
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:47,663
we sent everyone we could to the 21st.

852
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:49,665
All at once.

853
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,266
Into the quantum frame?

854
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:52,334
How many?

855
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,435
The frame is capable

856
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,803
of receiving and storing thousands.

857
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:55,804
So Forbes,

858
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,039
all those people with the FBI...

859
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,074
Are all Faction.

860
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,976
Every mission we've done since...

861
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:01,977
Has been for them.

862
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,780
The Faction has our own plan.

863
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:05,948
Overpopulation

864
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,316
is the single greatest threat
to the 21st century.

865
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:13,221
The Director wasn't capable
of seeing the natural solution.

866
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:15,891
How many people are gonna die?

867
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,459
The virus is genetically engineered

868
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,329
to preserve 70% of the population.

869
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:21,563
The future will survive.

870
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,900
And those of us who die, including me,

871
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,236
will have made a great sacrifice.

872
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,370
70%?

873
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:30,739
Jenny,
you're murdering over 2 billion people.

874
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,176
The mission comes first.

875
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:39,315
<i>Take positions
around the device and stand by.</i>

876
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,820
What the hell is that?
