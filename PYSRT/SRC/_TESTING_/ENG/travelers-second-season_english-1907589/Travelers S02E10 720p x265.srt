1
00:00:01,377 --> 00:00:03,011
Previously, on Travelers...

2
00:00:03,013 --> 00:00:05,312
Get off of me! You killed my child!

3
00:00:05,314 --> 00:00:06,813
The Director was the one who sent me!

4
00:00:06,815 --> 00:00:08,782
I was on a mission!

5
00:00:08,784 --> 00:00:10,184
You're alive because of me.

6
00:00:10,186 --> 00:00:11,619
And perfectly healthy.

7
00:00:11,621 --> 00:00:13,000
Am I?

8
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:14,988
When you reset me,

9
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,757
you left out some things.

10
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:18,659
She left out

11
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:20,152
what made me "me".

12
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:22,129
After the plane crash
that should've killed me,

13
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:23,697
my own consciousness

14
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,299
took refuge in the memories
of Grant MacLaren.

15
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:28,168
How do I possibly access that?

16
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,770
You're the doctor.

17
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:25,720
He thinks you don't like him.

18
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,908
You know what, who cares if I don't?

19
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,810
Well, he does.

20
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:31,378
He should get over it.

21
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,848
Anna, I don't think you get it.

22
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,249
Don't think I get what?

23
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:39,280
Bree?

24
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:42,222
Bree?

25
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:45,124
Anna Hamilton?
I'm Agent Hall with the FBI.

26
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,693
For your safety,
I need you to come with me.

27
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:48,294
What happened to my friends?

28
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:50,029
Your friends are gonna be fine,

29
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:51,931
but you won't be,
unless you get in the car right now.

30
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,199
Tell me why.

31
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:57,337
No! No! No!

32
00:03:57,339 --> 00:04:00,907
Ah! No!

33
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:16,722
Anna? Anna!

34
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,859
Anna!

35
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:32,604
What... will.. you... be?

36
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:41,400
What ww-will you b-become?

37
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,330
That's so good!

38
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:45,870
You wanna try the next part?

39
00:04:45,872 --> 00:04:46,885
No.

40
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,974
Come on, girl. You can do it.

41
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,060
Tomorrow.

42
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:52,937
It can't always say "tomorrow".

43
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,034
I'm here now, so let's try it.

44
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:58,195
Marcy! Mercy me. Time to rock and roll.

45
00:04:58,197 --> 00:04:59,798
This is her reading time.

46
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,965
The man wants to see her now,

47
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,966
which makes it

48
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,301
treatment time.

49
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,635
Let's go.

50
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,217
I told her she didn't have to go today.

51
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:08,906
Well, you shouldn't have said that, bud.

52
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:09,907
I don't...

53
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,976
I don't want t-treatment!

54
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,278
No! No!

55
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,505
Hey. She's a person.
Treat her with respect.

56
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:19,249
You do your fricking job,
or you won't have one.

57
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:21,785
I don't want to go...

58
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:22,853
I don't wanna go!

59
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,822
I'll be here for you when it's over.

60
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,389
No!

61
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:29,493
James! James!

62
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,663
I don't want treatment!

63
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,665
I don't want it.

64
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,033
Hey. Hey.

65
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:38,668
Behave,

66
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,570
or there'll be no ice cream after.

67
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:43,840
I don't want it. I don't want it.

68
00:05:43,842 --> 00:05:45,641
I don't want it.

69
00:05:45,643 --> 00:05:47,877
Dear, sweet Marcy.

70
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,513
Don't be afraid, dear.

71
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,415
I have no desire to hurt you,

72
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,718
and I mean that sincerely.

73
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,487
No, quite the opposite.

74
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,691
I only want to make you whole again.

75
00:06:07,398 --> 00:06:09,031
What'd the messenger say?

76
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:11,033
Another Traveler team
needs tactical support

77
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,634
in less than an hour
at these coordinates.

78
00:06:12,636 --> 00:06:14,403
Got it. Where's the boss?

79
00:06:14,865 --> 00:06:16,372
Mac, where are you?

80
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:18,207
Must be off-com.

81
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:19,841
We can stop by
Kathryn's place on the way.

82
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:21,043
Where's Marcy?

83
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:22,144
She just texted me.

84
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:24,640
She's having some kind
of medical procedure.

85
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:27,148
We're just gonna have to do
the mission without her.

86
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,017
Okay, so nobody get shot today.

87
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:30,585
That's a good rule in general.

88
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,824
Hello?

89
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:38,894
Hi. I'm so sorry to bother you at home,
Kathryn.

90
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:40,161
What? How do you know my name?

91
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:41,829
He's one of my C.I.'s,

92
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:43,697
who knows better than to come here.

93
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,400
It's an urgent C.I. thing.

94
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,401
All right.

95
00:06:46,403 --> 00:06:48,503
Are you the one
who stole my husband's car?

96
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:49,904
Well, actually, that's a funny story.

97
00:06:49,906 --> 00:06:51,360
For another time.

98
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,707
Be back soon.

99
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:07,880
Look, um...

100
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,680
I need this job.

101
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:16,520
Just, uh...

102
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,232
Don't let it melt.

103
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:29,600
Marcy?

104
00:07:30,245 --> 00:07:32,344
Did it work this time?

105
00:07:32,346 --> 00:07:33,713
Oh.

106
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:34,781
I told him

107
00:07:34,783 --> 00:07:37,216
information transfer was way,
way too slow.

108
00:07:37,218 --> 00:07:38,718
I tried to fix it.

109
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:42,000
To get you back in...

110
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,591
You're still in there.

111
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:47,926
You don't know because you're not here.

112
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,130
He knows.

113
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,100
I'll keep trying,

114
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,965
but squid transistors
barely even exist here and now.

115
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,320
You gonna eat that?

116
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,720
Can I have it?

117
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,560
Okay.

118
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:10,148
Well, if they're after me, then...

119
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,217
how do you know my parents are safe?

120
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,218
Well, because

121
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,953
they're also under protection.

122
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:16,622
Right? And that's question number six.

123
00:08:19,994 --> 00:08:22,227
Oh, great.

124
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,001
What the hell are you doing here?

125
00:08:25,003 --> 00:08:27,798
I'm not exactly thrilled
about it either.

126
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,799
We got a messenger.

127
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:30,332
Tactical support at these coordinates.

128
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:31,869
Tactical?

129
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,139
I don't know. I, uh, I think we're good.

130
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:36,474
The Director doesn't seem to think so.

131
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,643
Where are all the customers?

132
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:40,310
You ever eat here?

133
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,760
I like it.

134
00:08:44,443 --> 00:08:45,808
Who's she?

135
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,385
That's, uh, 53.

136
00:08:49,883 --> 00:08:51,840
As in "P.O.T.U.S."

137
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:53,484
Centuries before my time,

138
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:54,518
but I'm pretty sure

139
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,320
the 53rd President
was another old white guy.

140
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:59,656
Do you even remember
the other candidate that year?

141
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:01,025
How close that election was,

142
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,593
and how the country
was torn apart after?

143
00:09:05,398 --> 00:09:08,098
Anna,
say hello to Special Agent MacLaren.

144
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,099
It's an honor

145
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:10,299
to meet you, Ms. Hamilton.

146
00:09:14,706 --> 00:09:16,160
Hi.

147
00:09:17,543 --> 00:09:19,910
So, are you assigned to protect me, too?

148
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:21,377
Actually...
Yeah, you know, he is.

149
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:22,378
Until 1600 hours.

150
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,180
Why do I need protection?

151
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:25,181
Hey, we had an agreement, right?

152
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:26,916
Ten questions? You're already at eight.

153
00:09:26,918 --> 00:09:28,284
Ten questions?

154
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:29,609
Yeah, whatever.

155
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,187
What happens at 1600?

156
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:32,655
How the hell should I know?

157
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:34,490
All I got to do is make sure that,
until then, she's...

158
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:35,558
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

159
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,726
Get her to cover now. Now!

160
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:46,068
FBI! Get down and stay down!

161
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:50,880
We just lost a camera.

162
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,909
Tracking four targets.

163
00:09:55,046 --> 00:09:57,613
You call this "tactical"?

164
00:09:57,615 --> 00:09:58,881
Carly! Trevor?

165
00:09:58,883 --> 00:09:59,781
Ready, boss!

166
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:01,249
In position.

167
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:08,557
Ah!

168
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:12,094
Trevor, your 9:00,

169
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:13,728
moving toward the west side
of the restaurant.

170
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:36,650
The Director got the last one.

171
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:37,651
We can't count on

172
00:10:37,653 --> 00:10:39,153
the Director to have eyes everywhere.

173
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:40,121
We should move.

174
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,255
Stand by.

175
00:10:41,257 --> 00:10:42,756
We're moving somewhere safe.

176
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,958
You know,
we were fine until you showed up.

177
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,293
They must've followed you.

178
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:48,028
If we hadn't been ordered here,
you'd be dead,

179
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,162
and so would 53,

180
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:51,164
who I am taking to a
safehouse right now,

181
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,132
with or without you.

182
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,880
MacLaren's right.

183
00:10:54,503 --> 00:10:55,936
We should go.

184
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,808
Yeah, yeah.

185
00:11:07,506 --> 00:11:09,172
Come on, girl. Eat up.

186
00:11:09,174 --> 00:11:10,540
I don't have time for this shit.

187
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:12,742
You know what happens if you don't.

188
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:14,644
I w-want to go home.

189
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:16,679
This is home now.

190
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:19,400
No, I w-work here.

191
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,951
Get that outta your head.

192
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,720
I remember.

193
00:11:23,722 --> 00:11:24,721
All right.

194
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:26,976
Doesn't have to be the hard way.

195
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,394
Don't make me do that.

196
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,388
Hey!

197
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,094
You do it again and I'll report you!

198
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,957
You'll report me?

199
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,827
I'm not the one who looks at her ass

200
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:39,096
every time she walks away.

201
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,897
I don't do that.

202
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,332
Don't get me wrong, it's a...

203
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,934
Treat her with respect,
or I'll talk to Dr. Carroll.

204
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:46,103
Carroll?

205
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,304
Ha! That's perfect.

206
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,305
Boom!

207
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:49,639
Yeah, you go ahead and do that,

208
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:52,675
while I feed your hot little girlfriend.

209
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:00,416
You are done.

210
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,300
Don't even bother signing out.

211
00:12:02,302 --> 00:12:04,280
I don't wanna see your face.

212
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,168
I need to use the bathroom.

213
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,336
It's not far now.

214
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:21,970
You just have to hold it
a little longer...

215
00:12:23,273 --> 00:12:24,673
Madame President.

216
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,039
So in this timeline,
she actually wins the election.

217
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:30,372
Why would the faction not want that?

218
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,007
'Cause they're working off
old information.

219
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,009
Where are we going?

220
00:12:34,011 --> 00:12:35,810
That's an excellent question, Anna.

221
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:36,945
You, uh, you got one left.

222
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:38,947
To an old farmhouse that I know of.

223
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:40,448
We should be safe there.

224
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,716
That's what Special Agent Hall

225
00:12:41,718 --> 00:12:43,785
said about the restaurant.

226
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:44,920
"Agent"?

227
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:46,788
"Special".

228
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,524
Why isn't Marcy with you?

229
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:51,292
Some sort of minor medical procedure

230
00:12:51,294 --> 00:12:52,393
I wish she'd told me about.

231
00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:53,494
Is she all right?

232
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:56,760
I'm sure she's fine.

233
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:19,600
Simon... that's beautiful.

234
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:21,121
Thank you.

235
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:22,455
I like it.

236
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,457
Who is she?

237
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,493
0092.

238
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,328
No, I mean, what's her name?

239
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,996
0092.

240
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,832
She's not born for another two...

241
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,901
no, hundreds of years from now.

242
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:37,304
Oh! That's a very long time.

243
00:13:37,306 --> 00:13:38,805
Yes, it is.

244
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:41,074
Home, sweet home...

245
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:43,510
The ozone layer is gone by then.

246
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:45,511
That's just one problem.

247
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:47,379
In a hundred years,
there are way worse...

248
00:13:47,381 --> 00:13:48,984
we live under the ice.

249
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:50,083
Oh...

250
00:13:50,085 --> 00:13:52,503
The math's not that complicated,

251
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:55,321
You have two people
that want the same thing...

252
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,101
the two people fight over the one,

253
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,294
and then there's none.

254
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,492
Well...

255
00:14:00,494 --> 00:14:01,993
I have

256
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,960
two pills...

257
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,765
For one person.

258
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,434
Okay? There you go.

259
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,538
I'm not supposed to take
anything before treatment.

260
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,440
Marcy, isn't it?

261
00:14:15,876 --> 00:14:16,842
Uh, yeah.

262
00:14:16,844 --> 00:14:18,210
Good, I was hoping to catch you.

263
00:14:18,212 --> 00:14:19,344
Simon is correct

264
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:21,913
that I prefer he not be medicated

265
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,014
during the treatment.

266
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:24,916
Oh, well, there's a daily schedule,
Mr. Ingram.

267
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:26,118
Maintenance of the yeast vats,

268
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,252
first and foremost,

269
00:14:27,254 --> 00:14:29,121
is your responsibility to the community.

270
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:30,922
Please, Simon...

271
00:14:30,924 --> 00:14:33,024
allow me to speak with the orderly.

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
You go on ahead.

273
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,640
An hour is all I ask.

274
00:14:46,105 --> 00:14:48,005
Dr. Carroll approves.
You can check with her.

275
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:49,840
Dr. Carroll's gone home,
and I-I can't...

276
00:14:49,842 --> 00:14:50,975
Perhaps if you understood

277
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,310
more about the therapy I was working on.

278
00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:55,379
You're curious.

279
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:56,380
Of course, you curious...

280
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:57,760
More concerned.

281
00:14:58,217 --> 00:14:59,283
A few of the patients

282
00:14:59,285 --> 00:15:00,785
who've gone through your treatment...

283
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,286
haven't...

284
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:04,454
Returned to the ward?

285
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:08,892
Because they've been transferred

286
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:09,959
to another hospital

287
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:12,562
as promising candidates
for further research.

288
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:14,760
I can show you the paperwork.

289
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,402
The work we're doing here

290
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:21,004
is truly for the greater good, Marcy.

291
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,407
We're making progress, I promise.

292
00:15:28,146 --> 00:15:29,612
In fact...

293
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,982
if you're open to it,
I could use your help.

294
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,627
It's a nice spot.

295
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:46,086
Glad you approve.

296
00:15:46,088 --> 00:15:48,030
A sign on the road says it's for sale.

297
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,164
Might be a good investment.

298
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,033
FBI seized the house from a meth cook

299
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,703
who burned himself to death
in the kitchen, so...

300
00:15:53,705 --> 00:15:55,805
So, big kitchen?

301
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:58,207
I need you to set these claymores up

302
00:15:58,209 --> 00:15:59,541
there and there.

303
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:00,542
We can do that.

304
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,776
Conceal 'em best you can,

305
00:16:01,778 --> 00:16:03,545
then run the wires back to the house.

306
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,981
What,
you take orders from your tactician?

307
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,983
So should you.

308
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,179
Hey, look, I can still tell

309
00:16:11,181 --> 00:16:12,221
you got a problem with me,

310
00:16:12,223 --> 00:16:13,287
but you gotta get over that, all right?

311
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:14,989
The Director keeps putting us together.

312
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:16,458
Must be some good reason.

313
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,959
"Ours is not to reason why."

314
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:19,060
It's like we're two disciples,

315
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,462
but we don't see eye to eye.

316
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:21,563
I'm not in the mood for mythology.

317
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:22,897
But we're both disciples, right,

318
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,532
so what're you gonna do?

319
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:26,568
Hey, look, what I'm trying to say...

320
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,803
Don't you freakin' touch me, Hall!

321
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,604
Take it easy. Relax.

322
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,008
Let's just get to 1600.

323
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:53,427
The technology scans the brain

324
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,497
and records specific patterns,

325
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:59,566
not dissimilar to something like an MRI.

326
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,434
What exactly am I signing?

327
00:17:02,436 --> 00:17:03,937
Legalese.

328
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:09,276
The fee for allowing me
to perform the scans

329
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,960
is on the last page.

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,579
That's a lot of money.

331
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:19,800
Is it?

332
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:24,351
I'm embarrassed to say
that I've lost perspective.

333
00:17:31,381 --> 00:17:33,600
Simon... what are you doing here?

334
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,200
I helped build the first one
in the future, too.

335
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,393
Good for you.

336
00:17:39,922 --> 00:17:41,639
He likes to "assist."

337
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,691
I consider it part of his therapy.

338
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,294
Um, Mr. Ingram...

339
00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:48,630
uh, I've changed my mind.

340
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,632
You've signed the papers, you can't.

341
00:17:50,634 --> 00:17:52,432
I just did.

342
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:54,588
Marcy, it's a harmless scan.

343
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,970
You won't feel it.

344
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:57,238
Sorry, I don't...
I don't feel comfortable.

345
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,405
Please, be reasonable.

346
00:17:58,407 --> 00:17:59,406
I'm sorry.

347
00:17:59,408 --> 00:18:00,407
You can keep your money.

348
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,625
It's not about the money, my dear,

349
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:04,812
but now you've seen the device.

350
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:06,147
This is awkward.

351
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,748
Drake!

352
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:11,652
Move!
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

353
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:12,919
Let go of me!

354
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:23,463
You really should read
everything you sign.

355
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:24,985
No!

356
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,517
I'm always in awe
of the potential of youth.

357
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,953
Of what may come.

358
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,245
Even if we didn't know who she was.

359
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:57,570
If we succeed in our mission,

360
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,519
she'll become

361
00:18:58,544 --> 00:19:00,187
one of the great
leaders of a generation.

362
00:19:00,212 --> 00:19:01,211
Mm-hmm.

363
00:19:02,296 --> 00:19:04,960
So I'd very much like
to make it to 4:00.

364
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,112
I wonder if it's a coincidence

365
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:08,200
that the Director assigned you

366
00:19:08,202 --> 00:19:09,962
a mission to preserve
the life of a child

367
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:11,760
after what happened to you and Kathryn.

368
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,536
I think the Director
isn't a licensed therapist,

369
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:17,136
and neither are you.

370
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:19,205
I do understand
what you're going through.

371
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,473
You couldn't possibly.

372
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:22,175
Yeah, I do.

373
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:24,210
Even you forget.

374
00:19:24,212 --> 00:19:25,211
I've lived long enough

375
00:19:25,213 --> 00:19:27,680
to see two of my own
sons die of old age.

376
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,783
Uh, no. This isn't the same thing.

377
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:32,785
You're right, it isn't.

378
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,840
You're grieving a life lost
that hadn't even begun yet.

379
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,240
A loss of potential.

380
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,026
Anna has that.

381
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:42,773
All I'm saying.

382
00:19:50,884 --> 00:19:52,720
We got vehicles.

383
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:56,408
Yeah. I see 'em. Anna!

384
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,709
Get inside.

385
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,512
The Director will, too,
as soon as they get closer.

386
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:02,547
Smile for the camera, Mr. Faction.

387
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,600
Protocol three is suspended.

388
00:20:08,154 --> 00:20:09,921
Protect Anna Hamilton at all costs

389
00:20:09,923 --> 00:20:11,920
and hold until reinforcements arrive.

390
00:20:14,528 --> 00:20:16,394
What just happened?

391
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:18,362
Nothing happened. Just go inside.

392
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,231
You're fine.

393
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:23,734
Here I thought we were gonna

394
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:26,470
make it to 1600 without any trouble.

395
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,054
She doesn't even recognize me.

396
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:45,522
There was a malfunction.

397
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,858
Some information
was lost during the scan.

398
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,593
Simon is working to restore it soon.

399
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:50,594
Simon?

400
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:51,662
Until then, Marcy is now

401
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:53,363
to be considered
a patient of this facility,

402
00:20:53,365 --> 00:20:54,831
under the care of Dr. Carroll.

403
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,067
Dr. Carroll agreed to that?

404
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,269
And so will you.

405
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,371
I can make you very wealthy,

406
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:03,339
very easily.

407
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,478
We can move patients to different wings,

408
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,147
but there'll still be staff
who know Marcy as an employee.

409
00:21:11,149 --> 00:21:14,584
Bribe those you can
and get rid of the rest.

410
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,819
I leave it to you.

411
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,975
The Director should

412
00:21:39,977 --> 00:21:41,276
turn every one of them into hosts

413
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:42,277
or kill them by messenger

414
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:43,345
as soon as they're on camera.

415
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:44,980
Maybe Anna should hide
upstairs and wait...

416
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:46,514
Don't. If they don't find her,

417
00:21:46,516 --> 00:21:48,149
they'll burn this place to the ground.

418
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,251
It's what I'd do.

419
00:21:50,253 --> 00:21:51,920
Really?

420
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,560
And you...

421
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,992
keep your head down.

422
00:21:56,994 --> 00:21:58,660
Why do they want to hurt me?

423
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,996
Because they're afraid of you.

424
00:22:00,998 --> 00:22:02,363
More than you?

425
00:22:02,365 --> 00:22:04,160
Even more than me, yes.

426
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,280
Why don't we just talk to them?

427
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,970
Wow.

428
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,340
Even now...

429
00:22:13,843 --> 00:22:15,809
Anna, this won't happen,

430
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,346
but if they manage
to get through this door

431
00:22:19,348 --> 00:22:21,015
and they try to take you,

432
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,765
you fight them,

433
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:24,351
and you keep fighting,

434
00:22:24,353 --> 00:22:26,760
because help is on the way. Okay?

435
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,120
Okay.

436
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:51,813
Seriously?

437
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:53,812
That's all we got.

438
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:56,120
No, this'll help.

439
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:02,040
Didn't think the Director
would let them get this close.

440
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,060
We can't wait for the Director.

441
00:23:08,062 --> 00:23:10,720
Aim center mass. Shoot when I shoot.

442
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,566
Oh! Crash!

443
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:24,600
Sorry.

444
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:26,469
I didn't see that... that move comin'.

445
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:27,803
Are you okay?

446
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,006
I... I'm fine.

447
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,175
I'm fine.

448
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,943
Uh... I was...

449
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:36,511
I was watching you there a little bit,

450
00:24:36,513 --> 00:24:39,081
and I was thinking you looked lost.

451
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,250
Maybe I can help.

452
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:42,913
Is there some family that I can...?

453
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,519
Mm. Mm.

454
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,600
Turns out we're going
the same way anyway.

455
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,492
Um, what's your name?

456
00:24:50,494 --> 00:24:53,728
Uh, M... Marcy.

457
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,763
Marcy?

458
00:24:54,765 --> 00:24:55,930
Yeah.
Seriously?

459
00:24:55,932 --> 00:24:56,898
Yeah.

460
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,500
That is easily

461
00:24:58,502 --> 00:25:00,968
in my top ten favorite names
in the whole world.

462
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,537
You're the first one I've met in person.

463
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,309
My name's David.

464
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:26,017
Four of them are coming around
the south side of the house.

465
00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:27,770
Hall, that's you!

466
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:29,560
I know! I know!

467
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:34,543
It's like the freakin' Alamo!
Where's the Director?

468
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:36,520
They've gotta have an S.T.A.!

469
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:38,708
What?

470
00:25:39,117 --> 00:25:41,506
"Space-Time Attenuation" device.

471
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:43,030
It creates a field around 'em

472
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:44,788
in which the Director can't see 'em.

473
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:48,693
I see the S.T.A.!

474
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,761
It's in the green truck under the tarp!

475
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:53,094
Trevor... we need an end-run.

476
00:25:53,096 --> 00:25:54,195
Go.

477
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,765
Son of a bitch!

478
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:02,137
Cover him!

479
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,551
Like I said, it isn't much...

480
00:26:17,544 --> 00:26:20,120
But it's not the street,

481
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:21,956
and it's subsidized.

482
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:24,925
Do... Do you live... here?

483
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,101
No.

484
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:29,120
This is your place now, remember?

485
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:31,598
See, there's a...

486
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,280
there's a bed in here with...

487
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,471
clean sheets, like I promised,

488
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,805
and...

489
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
good, there's a towel, too.

490
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:44,424
And a dresser for all your things.

491
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,400
So first thing tomorrow, we'll...
we'll go...

492
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:51,840
get you some things.

493
00:26:53,188 --> 00:26:55,680
And here, there's a little fridge,

494
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,493
to keep your milk
for your cereal or your tea.

495
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,028
Do you like tea? Oh, looks like...

496
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:04,200
the previous tenant
left a big chunk of chocolate!

497
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:06,000
No, that's hash.

498
00:27:07,481 --> 00:27:08,801
Take that away.

499
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,440
And...

500
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:17,009
Good! That works, too.

501
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,944
You have a light to read your book by.

502
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:23,560
So, I will let you get settled in.

503
00:27:24,545 --> 00:27:27,179
N-No... d-don't go.

504
00:27:28,523 --> 00:27:30,120
Oh, I have to go.

505
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,320
I have other clients.

506
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,609
I-I did look up the hospital
you said you were a patient at.

507
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:38,700
I w-work there.

508
00:27:39,966 --> 00:27:41,333
You work there?

509
00:27:41,335 --> 00:27:42,299
Mm-hmm.

510
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:43,348
Huh.

511
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,137
Well, that's different.

512
00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:47,149
Either way,
they said they have no record of you.

513
00:27:47,151 --> 00:27:48,202
Oh!

514
00:27:48,204 --> 00:27:50,041
Don't go!

515
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,075
Okay.

516
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:55,760
I still have to go.

517
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:57,695
But I will be back tomorrow morning

518
00:27:57,871 --> 00:27:59,271
to take you shopping.

519
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,474
Oh, don't do that.

520
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,541
Oh, uh...

521
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:06,710
Okay?
Okay.

522
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:14,118
Don't forget to lock up.

523
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,640
Okay.

524
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:23,391
Okay.

525
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,120
David?

526
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:49,786
Surprise!

527
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,421
Hey.

528
00:28:51,423 --> 00:28:52,755
I know I said the paperwork

529
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,957
was gonna take seven days, but...

530
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,361
It only took a week.

531
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:03,886
Oh, you put some pictures up.

532
00:29:07,605 --> 00:29:08,920
Nice.

533
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,794
Uh, so this is the paperwork
we need to sign,

534
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,327
in order to get you
something to live on.

535
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:16,651
I've already filled out most of it,

536
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:18,776
we're just missing some things.

537
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:20,349
Um...

538
00:29:20,351 --> 00:29:22,484
Do you happen to remember your birthday?

539
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:27,021
Well, that's not a problem.

540
00:29:27,023 --> 00:29:29,157
We'll... We'll... We'll pick a day.

541
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:30,792
Oh...

542
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:32,227
Oh, wait! It's today.

543
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,880
What are the odds?

544
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,598
Well, one in 365,

545
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,700
but so long as we're saying today...

546
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,739
It's for... for my birth... birthday?

547
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:45,840
Yeah.

548
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:47,680
Everybody deserves a birthday present.

549
00:29:51,996 --> 00:29:53,067
It's not brand-new,

550
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:56,416
but, uh, it'll hold your stuff
when you go outside.

551
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,354
Ohh...

552
00:30:01,924 --> 00:30:04,057
My mom always says that it's bad luck

553
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:06,360
to give a bag as a gift
without putting money in it...

554
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:08,728
which, I guess, is why

555
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,930
I asked for a new bag every Christmas.

556
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:14,100
The only thing we need
to figure out now is your age.

557
00:30:14,102 --> 00:30:18,938
I'm guessing somewhere
between 22 and 26.

558
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,240
You pick.

559
00:30:20,588 --> 00:30:22,587
You pick.

560
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,711
42.

561
00:30:27,382 --> 00:30:29,015
56?

562
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,417
Seven?

563
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:32,968
No!

564
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,054
Well, you told me to pick.

565
00:30:36,357 --> 00:30:37,589
Okay. We'll go...

566
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:39,792
We'll go with 25.

567
00:31:11,825 --> 00:31:13,290
Carly?

568
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,892
I see it.

569
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:20,765
Hit the claymores!

570
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:22,132
Wait for my order.

571
00:31:30,009 --> 00:31:32,276
Philip,
there's two going around the back!

572
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:33,510
Understood.

573
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:08,611
It stopped short of the mines.

574
00:32:13,284 --> 00:32:14,783
Carly!

575
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,684
"'You're...

576
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:25,652
"a...

577
00:33:25,654 --> 00:33:27,253
"big...

578
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,022
"girl now, '

579
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:31,058
"said...

580
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,560
M-Mary's teacher."

581
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,432
I couldn't have read it better myself.

582
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,866
Have you been practicing?

583
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:41,834
Mm-hmm.

584
00:33:43,305 --> 00:33:44,804
Well, that deserves a...

585
00:33:44,806 --> 00:33:47,240
I better check to see what I have on me

586
00:33:47,242 --> 00:33:49,476
before I start making promises.

587
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,013
Oh, no, no, that's for you to buy

588
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:55,720
things you need.

589
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,760
Okay, we'll call it a loan.

590
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:00,920
Come on.

591
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,031
Marcy, what are you doing?

592
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,134
You're m-my... you're my boyfriend.

593
00:34:16,903 --> 00:34:18,803
I-I can't be your boyfriend.

594
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,140
I can be your friend.

595
00:34:22,376 --> 00:34:24,510
It's not because I don't like you,

596
00:34:24,512 --> 00:34:25,744
or that you're not

597
00:34:25,746 --> 00:34:28,614
one of my favorite people
in the whole world.

598
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:30,148
It's because it would...

599
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,320
it would be inappropriate.

600
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:37,288
Yeah, I know that's a...
that's a big word.

601
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,289
Mm-hmm.

602
00:34:38,291 --> 00:34:39,480
Listen.

603
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,793
Boyfriends come and go...

604
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,462
but if you want,

605
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,000
you can be my B.F.F.

606
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:50,334
That means "Best Friend Forever".

607
00:34:51,704 --> 00:34:53,204
And I don't just call anybody that.

608
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,280
4:00.

609
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,248
Where does the time go?

610
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,417
Is it over, Agent Hall?

611
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,587
Yeah, I think so, Anna.

612
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:25,289
You agree, Agent MacLaren?

613
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,758
Sure.

614
00:35:28,261 --> 00:35:30,061
Gotta go! I'm late!

615
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:31,600
For what?

616
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,080
Mom? Dad!

617
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,850
Mom. Dad.
All these people were trying...

618
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:53,832
We know.

619
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,019
I was so scared.

620
00:35:55,021 --> 00:35:56,787
It's all right, Anna.
They told us what happened.

621
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,398
But we're here now,

622
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,520
and we're gonna take you
some place safe, okay?

623
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:18,374
Hey, it's me,
I'm gonna be home around 5:00,

624
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,943
which is when I'm usually home,

625
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:21,377
but you asked when I was gonna be home,

626
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,780
so I am just confirming.

627
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,718
Did any of your people get hurt?

628
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,786
Everybody made it.

629
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,388
Why did you do this for me?

630
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,787
Ooh, no. That's...

631
00:36:33,789 --> 00:36:36,225
That's too bad,
that's question number eleven.

632
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,397
The future's gonna need people like you.

633
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,840
Thank you.

634
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,440
And thank you.

635
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,340
Bye, everyone.

636
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:57,516
I assume

637
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:00,882
her parents historically died
trying to protect her.

638
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:03,050
3:43 this afternoon.

639
00:37:03,052 --> 00:37:04,152
We'll make sure she never knows.

640
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:05,786
Well,
you'd better take good care of her,

641
00:37:05,788 --> 00:37:07,614
or you're gonna be
answering to both of us.

642
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:09,730
We trained for years to do just that.

643
00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:11,160
Good.

644
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:16,231
Agent MacLaren.

645
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,400
Agent Hall.

646
00:37:21,504 --> 00:37:23,440
Bugs the shit out of you, doesn't it?

647
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,243
Yep.

648
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:31,612
I got your favorite.

649
00:37:31,614 --> 00:37:33,580
"Police were forced to use tear gas

650
00:37:33,582 --> 00:37:34,615
"to disperse a crowd

651
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,183
"shortly after a not-guilty verdict

652
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:38,585

653
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,021
What?

654
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,090
I don't want to say anything

655
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:46,040
until we talk to a doctor, but...

656
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,030
I think a miracle just happened.

657
00:37:51,566 --> 00:37:52,732
Marcy?

658
00:37:53,735 --> 00:37:55,234
Marcy?

659
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:56,435
Marcy!

660
00:38:06,114 --> 00:38:08,214
You know, I think,

661
00:38:08,216 --> 00:38:10,749
if I die in my sleep tonight,

662
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:12,751
I'm good to go.

663
00:38:24,631 --> 00:38:26,965
One... two... three... four...

664
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:28,901
One... two... three...

665
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,386
Where's her medical kit?

666
00:38:31,387 --> 00:38:32,486
What happened? What did she do?

667
00:38:32,488 --> 00:38:33,854
I just got here myself!
Just get the bag...

668
00:38:33,856 --> 00:38:34,889
And bring it over here.
Was she shot?

669
00:38:34,891 --> 00:38:36,624
Get the bag!

670
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,706
Can you charge the defibrillator?

671
00:38:41,708 --> 00:38:42,629
What?

672
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:44,123
It's okay. Just take over.

673
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:45,600
Get the bag and take over.

674
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:48,368
Go, go, go, go, go!

675
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:53,173
One, two, three, four, five...

676
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,544
Mm. I can't believe
how much you suck at this.

677
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,546
This is nothing like actual surgery.

678
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:00,880
No, well, "wrenched elbow",
that's the easiest one.

679
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:01,881
That's not even a thing.

680
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:02,931
No, it is.

681
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:04,651
You know, I think I might
be a better doctor than you.

682
00:39:10,926 --> 00:39:12,358
Oh, she's coming back.

683
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,525
Oh, thank God.

684
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:14,526
All right. Help me.

685
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:15,561
Help me get her into the bed.

686
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:16,895
We've gotta get her body temperature up.

687
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,598
I thought something
terrible had happened to you.

688
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,600
You must be David.

689
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,403
I'm told we're close.

690
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:25,840
"Close"?

691
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,342
Marcy, we're very...

692
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,010
close.

693
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:32,840
W...

694
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,115
What's wrong?

695
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,458
No...

696
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,593
I'll yell at you later.

697
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,560
You find the missing pieces
you were looking for?

698
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:39,843
David...

699
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,679
you weren't supposed
to find that unless...

700
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:44,000
Unless you'd died.

701
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,040
Yeah, I figured that one out.

702
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,253
How could you do this?

703
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,490
Knowing that I was probably
gonna be the one to find you?

704
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,280
Right now she needs to rest.

705
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,267
Yeah.

706
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:06,308
Whatever.

707
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,647
Hey.

708
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,284
Sorry I was gone so long.

709
00:41:22,286 --> 00:41:25,080
It's okay. I was just dozing.

710
00:41:27,837 --> 00:41:29,236
Everything okay?

711
00:41:30,227 --> 00:41:32,920
Yeah. Everything's fine.

712
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,535
I saved a kid today.

713
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,727
David?

714
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:24,577
Oh. Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later.

715
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,912
Hey.

716
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:27,247
Hi.

717
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,117
I wanted to talk to you
before you left for work.

718
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,440
Yeah, no, I, uh...

719
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,588
thought maybe you'd want
to thaw some more.

720
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,000
Can we talk?

721
00:42:39,594 --> 00:42:41,080
Sure.

722
00:42:44,633 --> 00:42:45,598
If you wouldn't have found the note,

723
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,099
you would have never known.

724
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,268
Doesn't make it better.

725
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,771
It was the only way, David.

726
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:53,405
To do what?

727
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,408
To find the missing pieces of myself.

728
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,609
To find you.

729
00:42:57,611 --> 00:42:58,778
Okay, so?

730
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,146
Was it worth almost killing yourself?

731
00:43:00,148 --> 00:43:01,413
Because honestly, this is...

732
00:43:16,664 --> 00:43:18,763
Well, that was different.

733
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,666
I'm sorry that I scared you.

734
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,804
You have no idea.

735
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,006
If I hadn't...

736
00:43:31,783 --> 00:43:33,311
What?

737
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,600
What is it?

738
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,418
Do you know who did this?

739
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,323
Uh, yeah...

740
00:43:43,325 --> 00:43:45,367
some homeless guy, lives around here.

741
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:46,424
Why?

742
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,992
I need you to take me to him.
