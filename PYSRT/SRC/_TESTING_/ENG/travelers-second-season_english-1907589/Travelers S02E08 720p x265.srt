1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,344
Previously, on Travelers...

2
00:00:01,346 --> 00:00:02,567
Where's the quantum frame?

3
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,246
When you reset the Director,
we lost the ability

4
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:06,708
to access the 21st.

5
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,006
We should be working together!

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,039
I don't think so.

7
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:10,040
The Director had its chance!

8
00:00:11,243 --> 00:00:12,875
The Director's back up and running.

9
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:13,876
How many Faction are still here?

10
00:00:13,878 --> 00:00:15,611
It's impossible to know
how many were sent

11
00:00:15,613 --> 00:00:16,512
into the quantum frame.

12
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:18,080
Historically, Grace Day died today.

13
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:19,715
You jumped into the 21st illegally.

14
00:00:19,717 --> 00:00:21,083
You took a host
that wasn't meant for you.

15
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:23,519
I had evidence that an attack
on the Director was imminent!

16
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:24,987
I had no choice but to act!

17
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:26,188
When you reset me,

18
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,157
you left out some things.

19
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,859
What'd you leave out, Grace?

20
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:40,702
Targeting far left.

21
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,611
T.E.L.L. established.
Stand by. Target two.

22
00:00:53,116 --> 00:00:54,883
T.E.L.L. established.

23
00:00:59,857 --> 00:01:01,222
Traveler incoming on target one.

24
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:04,225
Take him out.

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,037
3468.

26
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,071
5401.

27
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:18,473
Yeah, he's dead.

28
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:20,211
We needed three to make it even.

29
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:22,109
He was gonna kill both of you.
Stay calm.

30
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:24,144
Stick to the plan.
I'll be right behind you.

31
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:39,326
What are you doing?

32
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,693
What do you mean? It's lunchtime.

33
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:41,928
You're supposed to be on sentry duty.

34
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,031
Oh, Jasper's still out there. It's fine.

35
00:01:44,033 --> 00:01:45,165
No, it's not fine.

36
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:47,401
There could be Travelers out there.

37
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:49,169
They're in here now.

38
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,737
Don't.
Hands in the air.

39
00:01:53,534 --> 00:01:55,241
Your protocols won't
let you take a life.

40
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:56,475
Protocol three's

41
00:01:56,477 --> 00:01:57,977
been suspended
for members of the Faction.

42
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:58,978
I wouldn't risk it.

43
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,446
Weapons down, hands up.

44
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:02,314
Where's the quantum frame?

45
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:04,817
Not here.

46
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:06,853
Secure them.

47
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,524
What're you going to do with us?

48
00:02:11,526 --> 00:02:13,192
That'll be up to the Director.

49
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:14,860
So death by overwrite.

50
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:16,795
You mean like you did to your hosts?

51
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:19,231
Our plan might have saved the future.

52
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:20,966
You people are pathetic.

53
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:24,070
Meaning we're capable of pity, sympathy,

54
00:02:24,072 --> 00:02:25,504
or compassion for others?

55
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:28,173
I've really been enjoying
English class this year.

56
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:29,474
Yeah. I can see that.

57
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:30,709
Let's get moving.

58
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,711
Move.

59
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:38,483
Stay still.

60
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:48,593
Okay,
let's see what we can pull from this.

61
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:49,561
You won't find anything.

62
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:50,395
I don't know.

63
00:02:50,397 --> 00:02:51,762
My people are pretty good at this.

64
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:52,797
Thanks, boss.

65
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,165
Be good at this.
Mm-hmm.

66
00:02:56,169 --> 00:02:57,569
We can always try torture.

67
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:58,903
No, we couldn't.

68
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:00,901
They've been in hiding so long,

69
00:03:00,903 --> 00:03:02,740
I doubt they know
where the frame is anyway.

70
00:03:02,742 --> 00:03:05,275
Even if we knew, we wouldn't tell you.

71
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:06,983
So someone point a camera this way

72
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,039
and end this.

73
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm good with that.

74
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:10,748
The Director has plans for them.

75
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,485
This is the first I'm hearing about it.

76
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:16,720
Because you are a part of those plans.

77
00:03:16,722 --> 00:03:18,322
A hearing has been ordered.

78
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:19,256
Your presence,

79
00:03:19,258 --> 00:03:20,390
along with 3569

80
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:22,192
and 0115, is required.

81
00:03:22,894 --> 00:03:24,083
Where?

82
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:26,163
You'll receive the coordinates tomorrow.

83
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:01,964
To selling our house.

84
00:04:01,966 --> 00:04:03,932
To selling our house over asking.

85
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:05,401
Yay!

86
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:06,517
We're officially homeless.

87
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,137
Well, I am.

88
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:09,643
Not till you finish packing.

89
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:15,343
I don't know
how you can drink that stuff.

90
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:17,146
Because I'm not allowed
to drink that stuff

91
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:19,414
and the calcium is good
for the development of bones.

92
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,916
You haven't touched
the almond milk I bought.

93
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,117
Grant, if there was ever

94
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:24,219
a time you were gonna lose
this vegan battle with me,

95
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,487
it's when I am pregnant.

96
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:26,541
Fair.

97
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:29,023
You know, I was thinking,

98
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,592
we should put some of the house money

99
00:04:30,594 --> 00:04:31,759
into a trust fund,

100
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,094
for college tuition.

101
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:34,262
College?

102
00:04:34,264 --> 00:04:35,963
That's years from now.

103
00:04:36,593 --> 00:04:38,766
You need to learn to
think of the future.

104
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,536
Oh, I've...
uh, I have given that some thought.

105
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:44,371
And I think...

106
00:04:44,373 --> 00:04:46,607
I'm gonna buy a boat with my half.

107
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,911
Given your history with the water,

108
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:51,946
I'd better take a life-insurance policy

109
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:53,047
out on you instead.

110
00:04:53,049 --> 00:04:55,949
Ow. Break one arm one time...

111
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:11,064
Were you planning on going
back to the house tonight?

112
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,599
It's early.

113
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:13,566
Are you kicking me out already?

114
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,298
No.

115
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:18,371
I'm asking you to stay.

116
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,725
You haven't changed position
since I left last night.

117
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,751
Oh. No, I guess I haven't.

118
00:05:38,727 --> 00:05:41,127
Find anything on their coms?

119
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,729
They've been all over the place.

120
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:46,165
This data is pretty much useless.

121
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:48,934
What about these points?

122
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:51,971
Looks like they frequented
these locations multiple times.

123
00:05:51,973 --> 00:05:53,605
Maybe the frame's there.

124
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:54,706
Where the frame might have been,

125
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,208
not where it is now.

126
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,177
Well, there's gotta be CCTV

127
00:05:58,179 --> 00:05:59,178
or traffic cams

128
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,512
in those areas.

129
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:01,546
Maybe you can pull the footage,

130
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:03,548
see if any of them picked anything up.

131
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,651
If the Faction left
anything on those cameras...

132
00:06:05,653 --> 00:06:07,085
and hey, I wouldn't...

133
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:10,228
then the Director would've
already found it by now.

134
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,870
Mmph.

135
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,361
Something's bothering you.

136
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:18,429
Timeline has changed a lot.

137
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:20,799
My knowledge of the future

138
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:21,900
is becoming obsolete.

139
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:24,202
It's going to be hard to stay relevant.

140
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:27,287
You're more than just
the team's encyclopedia, Philip.

141
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:29,707
Who else am I gonna call

142
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:30,975
when I can't get Jeffrey's cartoons

143
00:06:30,977 --> 00:06:32,243
to play on my phone?

144
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:33,377
So flattering.

145
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:35,913
Or make me music playlists.

146
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:38,783
Teach me about turtles.

147
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:41,686
The self-worth is just
coursing through my veins.

148
00:06:41,688 --> 00:06:43,678
You're like the rest of us now.

149
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:45,923
Just a human being.

150
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:47,057
And that's okay.

151
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:54,031
I gotta go to work, but I'll com in.

152
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:57,693
Have a nice day.

153
00:06:57,695 --> 00:06:59,402
Go for a walk!

154
00:07:20,425 --> 00:07:22,525
Oh! My... God.

155
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,661
I guess we were making up for lost time.

156
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:26,829
Lost time?

157
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,364
I don't even know what day it is.

158
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:29,631
I know.

159
00:07:34,138 --> 00:07:36,305
I'm gonna be in court all day, so...

160
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:37,673
I'll be hard to reach.

161
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:40,442
But I'll see you tonight?

162
00:07:51,955 --> 00:07:54,890
How's that for an answer?

163
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,497
Grant?

164
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,134
I love you.

165
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,403
I love you, too.

166
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,078
3468.

167
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,480
Coordinates are as follows...

168
00:08:19,482 --> 00:08:21,949
47.6050 degrees North,

169
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:25,052
by 122.3344 degrees West.

170
00:08:26,523 --> 00:08:28,656
Why am I in the hallway?

171
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:30,357
Is it time for school?

172
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,226
Not yet.

173
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:34,328
Are you our new neighbor?

174
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,865
I guess I am.

175
00:08:39,461 --> 00:08:41,235
Have a nice day, neighbor.

176
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,023
What are you doing here?

177
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,362
He asked first.

178
00:09:09,364 --> 00:09:10,430
A messenger gave me

179
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:11,730
the coordinates for a hearing.

180
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:12,966
Scared me half to death.

181
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,106
Maybe it's their trial.

182
00:09:21,108 --> 00:09:23,075
Shouldn't take long then.

183
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:32,918
All rise for the arrival
of the Tribunal Committee.

184
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,920
I'm Traveler 009.

185
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:11,655
You may refer to me as the Speaker.

186
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:15,726
I'm joined by Travelers 0017 and 0029.

187
00:10:15,728 --> 00:10:16,957
They're programmers.

188
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,829
What the hell are all of you doing here?

189
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,264
Who's maintaining the Director?

190
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:21,999
0027.

191
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:25,802
We came to the 21st
as instructed by the Director.

192
00:10:26,276 --> 00:10:28,153
Unlike yourself.

193
00:10:29,675 --> 00:10:31,307
So that's what this is about?

194
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,176
0027...

195
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:35,946
you are charged with conspiracy
against the Director

196
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:39,282
and the high crime
of interrupting the Grand Plan.

197
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:04,339
I liked that one.

198
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:06,208
Can you add it to my playlist?

199
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,279
And just like that,
I am reduced to being Carly's DJ.

200
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:13,649
Something upbeat, please.

201
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,218
Any luck with the footage?

202
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,387
They wiped everything,
just like we thought.

203
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:19,921
I'm running serial numbers

204
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:21,890
of the weapons they were carrying.

205
00:11:21,892 --> 00:11:23,492
Grasping at straws here.

206
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:24,826
They're bound to slip up,

207
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:27,362
and when they do,
we'll be ready for 'em.

208
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:28,763
Dropping by Ops after work?

209
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:31,800
No,
I gotta pick up Jeffrey from the sitter,

210
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:34,202
get some groceries...

211
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:36,437
bring my van to the mechanic.

212
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:38,873
I've been having trouble
starting it in the mornings.

213
00:11:39,977 --> 00:11:41,542
Maybe I could be a mechanic.

214
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:43,277
I do live in a garage.

215
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,545
Stop it.

216
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:46,748
You are a valuable member of the team...

217
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,816
and a great DJ.

218
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:51,385
Next song, please.

219
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,261
3468, please take the stand.

220
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,606
Recount to us

221
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:15,343
how you first made contact with 0027.

222
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:17,978
I met Grace several months ago,

223
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,455
when my team was given a mission

224
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:21,148
to greet Traveler 0014,

225
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,249
Ellis.

226
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:23,383
Grace arrived

227
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:24,551
at the same time

228
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:26,620
and said her mission was to help Marcy.

229
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,356
But that was a lie, wasn't it?

230
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,157
No, it wasn't. I saved her life.

231
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,559
The defendant will
refrain from interjection.

232
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,594
If you refrain from leading questions!

233
00:12:34,596 --> 00:12:36,696
Go ahead. He interrupted you.

234
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:39,766
Later, we learned she was actually here

235
00:12:39,768 --> 00:12:40,833
to reset the Director

236
00:12:40,835 --> 00:12:43,636
by taking advantage
of Marcy's new T.E.L.L.

237
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,238
And you were unaware
of this secondary objective?

238
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,007
She eventually told us. Prior to that,

239
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,909
we believed that
she was only here to save Marcy.

240
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:50,910
Which I did.

241
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:52,779
And for which I am deeply grateful.

242
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:53,980
You're welcome.

243
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,147
At any point,

244
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,149
did you suspect that she was
a member of the Faction?

245
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,450
In the future we left,

246
00:12:58,452 --> 00:12:59,827
there was no Faction.

247
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:02,087
Protocol two has kept us in the dark.

248
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:03,222
We had no idea.

249
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:04,790
And who wrote protocol two?

250
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:06,792
Oh, come on! You know I did.

251
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:07,826
0027, please.

252
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,795
Teams in the 21st shouldn't be

253
00:13:09,797 --> 00:13:11,663
made aware of every change in the future

254
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,677
because completion rates of our missions

255
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,023
would drop exponentially.

256
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:17,729
You have been asked by
the tribunal not to interject.

257
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,604
Operatives would
be paralyzed with the fear

258
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:21,239
of how their actions
could negatively affect

259
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:22,207
the people they left behind.

260
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:24,442
Enough!
I agree!

261
00:13:24,444 --> 00:13:26,144
If I hadn't reset the Director,

262
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:27,839
the Faction would have corrupted it,

263
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,515
which means the Faction would
have control of the past.

264
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:31,629
What I did

265
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:34,985
was the only way
to save Marcy and the Director.

266
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:37,655
It was the Director
who ordered this hearing,

267
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,824
not any one of us.

268
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:41,426
Why?

269
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:43,528
It knows what really happened.

270
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,329
It knows what I sacrificed.

271
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:47,898
This... This makes no sense.

272
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,101
And yet here we are.

273
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:52,502
We will take a brief recess

274
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,839
to allow that fact to sink in.

275
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:08,599
Blair, hi, it's David. I...

276
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,367
Hi! You're still at home.

277
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:13,831
Yeah, I was just calling

278
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,367
to leave a message
to wish you a happy birthday,

279
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:19,337
so, uh, happy birthday.

280
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:21,305
Yeah.

281
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,974
Anyhoo, that's the one
and only reason I was calling,

282
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,807
so have a great...

283
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:28,612
A rave?

284
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:30,180
Oh.

285
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,949
No.

286
00:14:31,951 --> 00:14:34,818
No, no, I don't, um...

287
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,654
I don't do raves.

288
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:39,156
It's just not my...

289
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:42,792
Tell you what, I'll say maybe.

290
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,159
And, uh...

291
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,031
Yeah. I'll try.

292
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:52,835
Yeah,
I'll-I'll try to maybe see you later.

293
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,473
Okay. Yeah, bye.

294
00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:03,179
0115...

295
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:04,914
were you responsible

296
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,584
for interrupting Grace Day's
original T.E.L.L.?

297
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:08,651
I was.

298
00:15:08,653 --> 00:15:09,852
Whose orders were you acting on?

299
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:11,087
No one's.

300
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,855
Then why'd you do it?

301
00:15:12,857 --> 00:15:14,323
I didn't want her to die.

302
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:15,523
That simple.

303
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,293
As a Traveler,

304
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:19,061
you don't just inherit the host body,

305
00:15:19,063 --> 00:15:20,396
you inherit the lives they've touched...

306
00:15:20,398 --> 00:15:22,030
family, friends...

307
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:26,034
Grace Day was merely
a guidance counselor

308
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:27,603
at your host's high school.

309
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:29,805
That doesn't do her justice.

310
00:15:29,807 --> 00:15:31,507
See, my host was a bully.

311
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:33,174
Cruel.

312
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:35,677
She tried to help him anyway.
She was there for him.

313
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,079
For me.

314
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,581
And historically,
she was supposed to die.

315
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,283
I rationalized
that one person wouldn't matter

316
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:43,752
to the Grand Plan,

317
00:15:43,754 --> 00:15:45,286
but I was lying to myself.

318
00:15:45,928 --> 00:15:49,224
I broke protocol
because she did matter to me...

319
00:15:49,807 --> 00:15:52,059
and I'm willing
to accept the consequences.

320
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,129
Because of your actions,

321
00:15:54,131 --> 00:15:55,896
0027

322
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:58,359
locked out all transfers to the 21st

323
00:15:58,361 --> 00:16:01,068
until she could send herself
into the host Grace Day,

324
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,371
halting the Traveler program
for four hours.

325
00:16:03,373 --> 00:16:05,239
I couldn't just go into anyone.

326
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,108
Dozens of missions were canceled.

327
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,943
A Traveler was supposed
to arrive in Germany

328
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:11,411
and prevent
an impending train derailment.

329
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:13,114
All the passengers died.

330
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,460
A team meant to arrive in England

331
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:17,051
and stop a terrorist attack

332
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:18,085
was unable to transit.

333
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:20,154
I assumed the Director would choose

334
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:21,955
a new host
for the next scheduled Traveler.

335
00:16:21,957 --> 00:16:23,653
The Grand Plan is fluid.
It's constantly shifting.

336
00:16:23,655 --> 00:16:25,317
The Director is constantly analyzing

337
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,731
a myriad of outcomes

338
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:29,095
and course-correcting
to the fraction of a second.

339
00:16:29,097 --> 00:16:31,165
Are you trying to school me
in the matrix of algorithms

340
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,833
the Director uses
to oversee the Traveler program?

341
00:16:33,835 --> 00:16:35,802
For the last time, 0027.

342
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:38,304
If the crime is
disruption of the Grand Plan,

343
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:41,074
then I'm the one
who allowed that to happen.

344
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,143
I'm the one that should be punished.

345
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:47,089
The Director will
no doubt take it into account.

346
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,415
You may step down.

347
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:00,326
2103,

348
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:01,927
will you please take the stand?

349
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:03,696
Oh, seriously? That guy hates me.

350
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,376
Philip, I have a situation.

351
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:21,379
Hey, what's the good news?

352
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:23,615
Definitely not my paycheck.

353
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:26,218
How the hell do they expect
people to live on this?

354
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,688
And the capitalist-socialist
debate strikes again.

355
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,889
Well, this isn't enough for me
to cover my expenses this week.

356
00:17:31,891 --> 00:17:33,225
Can you top me up?

357
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:36,461
Sure, let me see
what I can move around for you.

358
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:53,010
This can't be right.

359
00:17:54,147 --> 00:17:55,646
What? What is it?

360
00:17:55,648 --> 00:17:58,149
Something happened
to the market this morning

361
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,516
when I was out for a walk.

362
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:02,386
Our investments are down.

363
00:18:04,246 --> 00:18:05,689
I'm scared to tell you how much.

364
00:18:05,691 --> 00:18:07,378
How did that happen?

365
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,852
Most of our higher-risk investments

366
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,561
just crashed and burned.

367
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,701
We're in serious financial trouble.

368
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:17,500
This was a meeting Ken had
been preparing for a month.

369
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:20,737
I mean, he had...
he had note cards and everything.

370
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:23,206
And, uh...

371
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:27,441
Even had his hair slicked back,

372
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:30,680
which is a clear sign that,
you know, it's important.

373
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,783
You gonna get that?

374
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,932
Uh, no. No, I'm not.

375
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:38,588
Anyway, ahem.

376
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,922
So we're all sitting there,

377
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:42,425
and he stands up to do his presentation,

378
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:45,027
and his fly, it's wide open.

379
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,028
Oh, no.

380
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,930
Was his penis exposed?

381
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:50,866
Uh, no...

382
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:53,602
no, I mean, that would...
that would be...

383
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:55,271
But, anyway.

384
00:18:55,273 --> 00:18:57,940
There's a window in his office,

385
00:18:57,942 --> 00:18:59,408
and I think, midway through,

386
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,976
he must have caught his reflection...

387
00:19:00,978 --> 00:19:02,477
Because he just...

388
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:04,646
he just knew,

389
00:19:04,648 --> 00:19:06,048
and there was nothing
he could do about it,

390
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,717
but you could see him
debate it in his head, like...

391
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,886
"Do I do up my fly
while I'm still talking?"

392
00:19:11,888 --> 00:19:13,988
Have I met Ken?

393
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,057
That's the funny thing...
you actually have.

394
00:19:16,972 --> 00:19:18,660
You've actually
asked that question before.

395
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:20,629
Oh.

396
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,133
This looks good.

397
00:19:47,623 --> 00:19:50,791
Blair! You're not allowed
to do this on your birthday.

398
00:19:50,793 --> 00:19:53,961
He's so not worth it.

399
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:56,429
Hold onto me!

400
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,517
What's happening?

401
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:02,620
But, then, why did, um...

402
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:04,145
why did Ken change his mind?

403
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:05,779
I don't know.

404
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,716
I just, I came in
ready to pack up all my things,

405
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:11,652
and he told me I still had a job.

406
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,242
It's a mystery.

407
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:17,639
Do you want some more wine?

408
00:21:17,641 --> 00:21:19,125
Um, maybe in a minute.

409
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:20,461
I'm just gonna use the bathroom.

410
00:21:20,463 --> 00:21:22,463
Excuse me.

411
00:21:33,475 --> 00:21:34,741
David, please!

412
00:21:34,743 --> 00:21:37,177
Help me! Please, I need your help!

413
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:38,544
I'm locked in a stall!

414
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:39,479
They're trying to come in.

415
00:21:39,481 --> 00:21:40,981
Please! Please, help me!

416
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,046
Uh... um.

417
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:53,659
Where are you going?

418
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:54,660
Uh...

419
00:21:54,662 --> 00:21:57,162
Here, listen to this...

420
00:21:57,164 --> 00:21:59,331
David, please! Help me!
Please, I need your help!

421
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,267
Wait! I'm coming with you.

422
00:22:02,336 --> 00:22:04,437
Here.

423
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,139
And by a nose,

424
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:09,562
"Saladin's Vigil"
crosses the finish line.

425
00:22:10,177 --> 00:22:12,177
And by a nose,

426
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:15,180
"Nemesis Star" crosses the finish line!

427
00:22:15,182 --> 00:22:17,516
That was down to the wire.

428
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:20,052
"Outbreak Prime"
is well ahead in the lead

429
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:21,620
to win first place.

430
00:22:21,622 --> 00:22:24,022
"Outbreak Prime" is well ahead...

431
00:22:24,024 --> 00:22:26,458
but, now,
pulling up from the middle of the pack

432
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,927
is "Gjallahorn"!

433
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:39,503
Shit.

434
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,173
So what is a rave?

435
00:22:42,175 --> 00:22:46,577
An illegal dance party with loud music,
drugs, alcohol.

436
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:48,011
Not that I've ever been to one.

437
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:51,148
I don't dance
so much as I rhythmically stand.

438
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,716
Wait...

439
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:53,984
if there's supposed to be loud music,

440
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:55,753
shouldn't we be hearing it by now?

441
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:59,889
Uh... yeah.

442
00:23:04,196 --> 00:23:06,729
What, you just carry that around?

443
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:07,911
Yep.

444
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,039
Blair?

445
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,583
Hey.

446
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:30,587
What happened? Hey?

447
00:23:33,124 --> 00:23:34,357
She's overdosing.

448
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,293
We need to get her
to a hospital and administer...

449
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:39,528
You just carry that around?

450
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,098
A lot of my clients
have addiction problems.

451
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:45,567
Hey...

452
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:47,036
David?

453
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:48,570
What happened?

454
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:51,239
We were in the bathroom...

455
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:54,833
People started screaming.

456
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:56,678
When I came out,

457
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,947
they all turned on me.

458
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:00,949
Give me your phone.

459
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:05,786
Okay, we're gonna get you to a hospital,

460
00:24:05,788 --> 00:24:08,156
and you're gonna be okay, all right?

461
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:18,900
Hey...

462
00:24:18,902 --> 00:24:21,236
I'm at a building at the corner
of 50th and Baker.

463
00:24:21,238 --> 00:24:23,070
I don't know how they moved it so fast,

464
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:24,839
but the frame was here
less than an hour ago.

465
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:25,940
Who're you talking to?

466
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:27,408
Pull up the camera feeds.
I'll be right over.

467
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,843
Camera feeds?

468
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:31,012
You need to get her to a hospital.

469
00:24:31,014 --> 00:24:32,279
I need to go.

470
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:34,314
Okay. Marcy!

471
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,517
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

472
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:38,652
They wiped all the footage
before they left again,

473
00:24:38,654 --> 00:24:40,187
but we know for certain
that the frame was there.

474
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,856
Well,
thank God for the selfie generation.

475
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,391
Can you zoom in there?

476
00:24:44,393 --> 00:24:46,160
Faction took everyone at the rave

477
00:24:46,162 --> 00:24:49,163
except three women who were
apparently in the bathroom.

478
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:50,330
We found them overdosed,

479
00:24:50,332 --> 00:24:52,266
probably a way of
eliminating them as witnesses.

480
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:53,633
And they survived?

481
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:55,501
David and I managed to save one of them,

482
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,537
but she didn't see anything.

483
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,105
But it's a safe bet
everyone else in the photo's

484
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:00,640
a Faction.

485
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:02,776
It makes sense,
but I don't know how you prove it.

486
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,679
Locate them, if you can.

487
00:25:05,681 --> 00:25:08,615
We have to get back
to the hearing marathon.

488
00:25:08,617 --> 00:25:09,950
How's that going? Can you say?

489
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:11,984
Not looking good for Grace.

490
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:14,653
Marcy...

491
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:15,988
how and why

492
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,358
did 0027 "repackage" your consciousness?

493
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:24,564
Well, obviously,
I don't actually remember,

494
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,532
but from what I was briefed on,

495
00:25:26,534 --> 00:25:28,734
she showed me a code.

496
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,636
Something that Ellis created...

497
00:25:30,638 --> 00:25:32,104
a backdoor hack,

498
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:35,227
which, during the repackaging process,

499
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:37,643
somehow managed to reset the Director.

500
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:40,278
Admittedly, a brilliant piece of work.

501
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,614
Thank you.

502
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:43,381
And how has that worked out for you,
Marcy,

503
00:25:43,383 --> 00:25:44,816
this "reset" of your consciousness?

504
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:46,585
Uh, how is this relevant?

505
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,852
I restored her.

506
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:49,554
Do you feel restored, Marcy?

507
00:25:50,624 --> 00:25:52,308
I no longer have seizures.

508
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,661
But do you feel as you did before?

509
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,372
No.

510
00:25:57,664 --> 00:25:59,731
But that's partly
because I have no memory

511
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,470
of my time spent in the 21st prior.

512
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:04,669
There are... missing pieces, then?

513
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,171
Yes.

514
00:26:07,758 --> 00:26:09,273
Marcy...

515
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:10,574
I've studied your M.R.I.s.

516
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:11,776
She had to have taken out

517
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,577
more than just a few months of memories.

518
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,618
What else did you take out?

519
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,718
I told you.

520
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,120
Redundancies, useless things.

521
00:26:23,122 --> 00:26:24,201
Such as what?

522
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:26,123
Empathy? Emotions you lack?

523
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,124
Oh, shut up, 29.

524
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:29,092
You're practically a sociopath yourself.

525
00:26:29,094 --> 00:26:30,628
How could you do that to me?

526
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,795
You would have died!

527
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:34,097
Yeah, but that would've been
my choice to make.

528
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,465
You used me.

529
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:36,499
Yes, I did!

530
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:38,234
I prevented your suicide.

531
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:40,037
Life is precious,

532
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,471
and so are skilled
operatives in the field.

533
00:26:41,473 --> 00:26:42,773
I was just a means to an end.

534
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:43,940
Marcy, you're still you.

535
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:45,275
I swear to you.

536
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:47,443
I didn't take your soul.

537
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:49,646
How would you even know?

538
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,522
Carly, I think I found one
of the people in the picture.

539
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,429
Forget the first three.

540
00:27:07,431 --> 00:27:09,231
What do you think of four and five?

541
00:27:09,233 --> 00:27:11,934
Not a big fan of "Mason."

542
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:13,468
But it's so masculine.
Like a "stone mason."

543
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,671
It's also a jar

544
00:27:15,673 --> 00:27:16,672
you keep pickles in.

545
00:27:16,674 --> 00:27:18,674
What about your father's name?

546
00:27:18,676 --> 00:27:20,275
Oh, Wilbur's the pig in Charlotte's Web.

547
00:27:20,277 --> 00:27:22,111
And a Wright brother.

548
00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:26,481
Watch out. I might be contagious.

549
00:27:26,483 --> 00:27:28,584
I've built up an immunity.

550
00:27:28,586 --> 00:27:30,185
How're you feeling?

551
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:31,869
Didn't you hear? I don't have feelings.

552
00:27:31,871 --> 00:27:33,488
Yeah, you do.

553
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,923
I got you these.

554
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:36,458
What are they?

555
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,660
Try one. They're French.

556
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,497
At least if they throw the book at me,

557
00:27:43,499 --> 00:27:46,034
I can say I've had
21st-century French cuisine.

558
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:49,804
Why are you being nice to me?

559
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:51,005
Do you know something?

560
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,041
No. No,
it's because we wouldn't even be here

561
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:54,809
if you hadn't reset the Director.

562
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:55,810
You gotta understand

563
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:57,278
that they'll come to
the same conclusion.

564
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,095
Trust the judgment
of those mouth-breathers?

565
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:00,514
Please.

566
00:28:00,516 --> 00:28:01,716
Oh.

567
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,185
You need to take that?

568
00:28:05,187 --> 00:28:07,020
Ah, it can wait.

569
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:09,690
Besides, I gotta do this.

570
00:28:09,692 --> 00:28:10,958
Do what?

571
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,326
Bring it in, Grace! You need this.

572
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:13,326
I don't! Can we not...

573
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:14,361
Oh, it's happening.

574
00:28:14,363 --> 00:28:15,829
Come on, there you go.

575
00:28:15,831 --> 00:28:16,830
Okay. Thanks.

576
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:18,305
You can let go now.

577
00:28:19,168 --> 00:28:20,734
Wasn't so bad, was it?

578
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,237
I do feel a slight
release of endorphins.

579
00:28:23,239 --> 00:28:24,938
You see?

580
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,076
Do you have a regular sex partner?

581
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:38,251
You can't hate every one I come up with.

582
00:28:38,253 --> 00:28:39,386
Well, we don't even know

583
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:40,827
if we're going to have a boy or girl!

584
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:42,489
You think I'm getting too excited.

585
00:28:42,491 --> 00:28:43,757
You know what? You're right.

586
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,191
N-No.

587
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,928
No, I love to hear
the excitement in your voice...

588
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:51,563
when you're talking about new life.

589
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:54,633
Kat, I gotta get back into court.

590
00:28:54,635 --> 00:28:57,736
Just... Just narrow it down
to the top 100 or so,

591
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,205
and we'll go through it tonight, okay?

592
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:00,722
Okay.

593
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:04,410
0027,
you have heard the charges against you.

594
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,812
What do you have to say in your defense?

595
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:10,215
I've given it a great deal of thought,

596
00:29:10,941 --> 00:29:14,787
run the events over and over
in my mind a thousand times,

597
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:17,572
and to be honest...

598
00:29:20,694 --> 00:29:22,427
You should all be thanking me.

599
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:28,466
Like my very dear friend
just pointed out...

600
00:29:28,468 --> 00:29:30,268
Uh-oh.

601
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,937
If I hadn't have reset the Director,

602
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,639
none of you would be here right now.

603
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:37,542
The Director would be gone,
the Faction would have won,

604
00:29:37,544 --> 00:29:40,596
and billions of people would
be dead from a horrible plague,

605
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:41,972
so...

606
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:44,315
You're welcome!

607
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,185
0027...

608
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:50,488
the members of the Tribunal
will now deliberate.

609
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:53,257
We will announce
your final verdict tomorrow.

610
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,326
We are adjourned.

611
00:30:13,736 --> 00:30:14,703
May I help you?

612
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:17,206
Stacey Collins, we have a few questions.

613
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:19,874
How do you know my name?

614
00:30:20,302 --> 00:30:21,543
You were at a rave last night.

615
00:30:21,545 --> 00:30:22,611
Do you recognize this?

616
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:24,213
Where's the quantum frame?

617
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:27,281
You're standing right
beside it in the picture.

618
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,783
We know you're Faction.

619
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,452
What are you talking about?

620
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,553
We know you just arrived.

621
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:33,688
Maybe if you cooperate...

622
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,623
Who are you people?

623
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,093
Get away from me.
I'm calling the police.

624
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:42,030
Whoa! Carly.

625
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:42,963
She's Faction.

626
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:44,699
How do we prove it?

627
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:45,966
Who do we prove it to?

628
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,736
This is what happens when you improvise.

629
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:49,970
We can't just walk away.

630
00:30:49,972 --> 00:30:51,439
That's exactly what we have to do.

631
00:30:52,209 --> 00:30:54,408
But maybe we can follow
her or something.

632
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,947
Jesus! She actually called the cops!

633
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:09,229
Take care of yourself, okay?
I'll check in with you tomorrow.

634
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:13,146
Okay? Bye.

635
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:15,828
Yes, bye.

636
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:18,164
B... Bye-b...

637
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:19,499
Bye-bye.

638
00:31:22,804 --> 00:31:23,803
You do know

639
00:31:23,805 --> 00:31:25,826
Chinese food is my kryptonite.

640
00:31:26,675 --> 00:31:27,674
Oh, I just...

641
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:29,108
I know you've been going back and forth

642
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,277
to the hospital all day,

643
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,511
so I wanted to bring you some dinner.

644
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:33,345
Yeah! Thank you.

645
00:31:33,347 --> 00:31:34,446
I am starving.

646
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:36,482
How's Blair doing?

647
00:31:36,484 --> 00:31:37,616
Right.

648
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:39,381
Well, we got there just in time.

649
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:42,421
It was a lethal dose of fentanyl.

650
00:31:43,624 --> 00:31:45,758
On her birthday.

651
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,765
So they're gonna keep her
for the next couple days.

652
00:31:49,497 --> 00:31:50,976
Mm.

653
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,104
You're looking at me funny. What?

654
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:03,343
I'm just trying to figure something out.

655
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:14,186
I'm sorry.

656
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:15,687
I wasn't 100% finished chewing.

657
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:17,335
Marcy, stop.

658
00:32:17,724 --> 00:32:19,457
Why? What is it?

659
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:22,293
Let's, um...

660
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,128
let's not, okay?

661
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,942
You don't want to.

662
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,143
Oh, no, I do. I mean...

663
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:30,557
I really... but...

664
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,866
Not like this.

665
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,145
Not...

666
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,273
Not like an experiment

667
00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:41,151
to see how it makes you feel.

668
00:32:43,894 --> 00:32:45,822
Because I-I know...

669
00:32:46,663 --> 00:32:49,898
I know how it made me feel
when we made love.

670
00:32:51,912 --> 00:32:55,167
And it's as close as you can get
to another person

671
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:56,499
for 10 minutes.

672
00:32:56,973 --> 00:32:58,273
I mean, an hour.

673
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,675
I want to feel that.

674
00:33:00,677 --> 00:33:01,943
But you can't make yourself

675
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:02,978
feel something.

676
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,647
I mean, you either do or you...
you don't,

677
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:07,749
and I want you

678
00:33:08,498 --> 00:33:10,485
to want to.

679
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:14,388
I know that sounds like a bad song title

680
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,528
from the '80s, but...

681
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,575
Should I just go?

682
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,559
No! No, stay.

683
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,361
Share this with me,

684
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:23,364
and we'll make some tea

685
00:33:23,366 --> 00:33:27,768
and-and we'll talk,
like we do on Tuesdays.

686
00:33:32,274 --> 00:33:33,774
What should we talk about?

687
00:33:36,012 --> 00:33:39,793
With you, Marcy,
I could talk about anything.

688
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:49,156
0027, you've been charged

689
00:33:49,158 --> 00:33:50,520
with conspiracy against the Director

690
00:33:50,522 --> 00:33:52,626
and interruption of the Grand Plan.

691
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:54,594
You took a host
that wasn't intended for you,

692
00:33:54,596 --> 00:33:56,874
and you halted
the Traveler program for...

693
00:33:56,876 --> 00:33:58,898
You've already said all that!
Cut to the chase.

694
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,367
You've repeatedly stated

695
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:02,001
that your actions reset the Director

696
00:34:02,003 --> 00:34:03,402
and freed it from corruption.

697
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:04,508
Because they did.

698
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,507
Then who corrupted
the Director in the first place?

699
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:08,107
The most powerful A.I. in history,

700
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:09,842
orders of magnitude more powerful

701
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:11,243
than the human brain?

702
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:12,578
Who would have that capability?

703
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,739
Obviously, a quantum programmer
of the highest caliber.

704
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,972
So only the best among us.

705
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:17,973
Yes.

706
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,074
And who might that be?

707
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:20,409
Don't say it.
Obviously me!

708
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:22,611
But I didn't corrupt the Director!

709
00:34:22,613 --> 00:34:24,980
I was the one waving a red flag

710
00:34:24,982 --> 00:34:27,283
while you three were
lining up at the yeast vats,

711
00:34:27,285 --> 00:34:29,118
filling your bellies!

712
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,920
Traveler 0027,

713
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,555
your peers have reached
a unanimous verdict.

714
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:36,991
We find you guilty.

715
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:39,986
What?

716
00:34:39,988 --> 00:34:41,262
Escort her to the sentencing room.

717
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:44,499
Wait! W-W-W-Wait. Wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no!

718
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,801
No, no, no, no! MacLaren, do something!

719
00:34:45,803 --> 00:34:46,802
I'm sorry, Grace.

720
00:34:46,804 --> 00:34:47,803
Trevor, don't let them do this!

721
00:34:47,805 --> 00:34:49,504
You can't help her, Trev!

722
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:50,805
But she's innocent!
Trevor! Help me!

723
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:52,440
She doesn't deserve this!

724
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:53,507
She didn't do much to help her case.

725
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,644
It's in the hands of the Director now.

726
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,122
Be seated.

727
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,042
Your sentencing will begin shortly.

728
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,307
What do you think will happen to her?

729
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,844
If the Director agrees
with the Tribunal,

730
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,913
she'll probably be overwritten.

731
00:35:52,149 --> 00:35:54,082
Can I give you a ride home?

732
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:55,883
Oh, it's not that far.

733
00:35:55,885 --> 00:35:57,152
I think I'll walk.

734
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,640
I need to clear my head.

735
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,256
You okay?

736
00:36:01,643 --> 00:36:03,024
I'm fine.

737
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,955
Marcy?

738
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:23,698
May I speak with you?

739
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,712
Yes, of course, Programmer.

740
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:35,688
You may never get an apology from 0027,

741
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,989
but as a programmer,

742
00:36:36,991 --> 00:36:38,324
I want you to know how sorry I am

743
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:39,392
for what happened to you.

744
00:36:39,394 --> 00:36:41,427
Thank you, but that's not necessary.

745
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:42,529
Well, I think it is.

746
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:45,031
What 0027 did to you was criminal.

747
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:46,999
That sense of emptiness
that you must feel,

748
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:48,067
of not being whole...

749
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:50,670
It's offensive to me

750
00:36:50,672 --> 00:36:51,904
that someone would do that to you

751
00:36:51,906 --> 00:36:53,438
for their own agenda.

752
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,675
Well,
I guess she'll face the consequences.

753
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:57,866
But you shouldn't have to.

754
00:37:00,114 --> 00:37:01,947
I think I can offer you

755
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:04,583
the missing pieces
that you've been looking for.

756
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:07,417
This is my field of expertise.

757
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:09,921
I don't understand.

758
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,490
My new team has been doing research

759
00:37:11,492 --> 00:37:13,625
on preserving host memory.

760
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:17,296
In your case,
that would be your first iteration.

761
00:37:17,298 --> 00:37:19,931
I thought those memories
were lost forever.

762
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:22,300
Perhaps not all.

763
00:37:22,682 --> 00:37:24,936
Perhaps even the most powerful memories,

764
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,705
the most defining...

765
00:37:26,707 --> 00:37:28,271
are still there,

766
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,975
and I can get them back for you.

767
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:33,078
When?

768
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,813
Well, as soon as you like.

769
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,647
Of course,
if you need time to think about it.

770
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:38,740
No, there's nothing to think about.

771
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,720
Uh...

772
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:02,840
Unfortunate, what must happen to Grace.

773
00:38:02,842 --> 00:38:04,541
Is it?

774
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:07,577
In that it's a waste of intellect.

775
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,982
Returning to OPS now.

776
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:14,584
Bringing Marcy with me.

777
00:38:14,586 --> 00:38:16,527
Half-hour out.

778
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,822
I'll be ready.

779
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,879
Are you here?

780
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:54,189
I am here, 0027.

781
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:57,859
Call me Grace.

782
00:39:02,365 --> 00:39:04,701
I didn't betray you.

783
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,169
I would never betray you.

784
00:39:07,171 --> 00:39:09,304
You, of anyone, should know that.

785
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:10,806
You are one

786
00:39:11,624 --> 00:39:14,075
of four candidates,

787
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:17,912
although the probability of guilt

788
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:19,280
is

789
00:39:19,282 --> 00:39:22,249
negligible.

790
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:27,588
Then why are you going to overwrite me?

791
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,309
Be patient.

792
00:39:30,184 --> 00:39:31,892
I have not yet determined

793
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:34,829
who amongst you is the traitor.

794
00:39:44,273 --> 00:39:46,006
No...

795
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,008
No!

796
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,877
Who did this?

797
00:39:50,879 --> 00:39:52,412
I don't know.

798
00:39:52,414 --> 00:39:54,214
Was this your team?

799
00:39:58,253 --> 00:39:59,886
Well, the frame is powered,
it can still function.

800
00:39:59,888 --> 00:40:01,455
I can still help you, Marcy.

801
00:40:01,457 --> 00:40:04,057
We both know you're not
trying to help me.

802
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,967
You won't shoot.

803
00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:15,068
You want Ellis's

804
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,936
backdoor code to take over the Director,

805
00:40:16,938 --> 00:40:18,537
and you think it's still inside my head.

806
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:19,873
Listen to me, Marcy.

807
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,440
The future is at stake.

808
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:22,475
Drop your weapon!

809
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,184
What the hell happened?

810
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:33,886
Honestly?

811
00:40:33,888 --> 00:40:35,988
I don't even think that he knows.

812
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:42,427
The situation

813
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:44,217
is now resolved.

814
00:40:44,965 --> 00:40:48,333
0029 will be charged

815
00:40:48,335 --> 00:40:50,335
with the crime of Treason

816
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:53,372
and sentenced immediately.

817
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,010
You used my trial

818
00:40:59,012 --> 00:41:00,978
as an excuse to get
everyone here in the 21st,

819
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,313
to flush the traitor out?

820
00:41:02,315 --> 00:41:03,347
The frame...

821
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:06,317
has also been neutralized.

822
00:41:10,256 --> 00:41:12,578
You humiliated me.

823
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:16,493
I sacrificed everything for you,

824
00:41:16,495 --> 00:41:17,995
I-I left everything I knew behind,

825
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:19,630
just to save you.

826
00:41:19,632 --> 00:41:21,598
I'm sorry.

827
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,869
I hoped you would understand
it was necessary.

828
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,580
You're still gonna punish me,
aren't you?

829
00:41:42,321 --> 00:41:45,388
I know I took the life
of this host after the fact,

830
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,559
I know I interrupted the Grand Plan.

831
00:41:49,561 --> 00:41:51,861
Ellis is dead because of me.

832
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:55,788
But I can never go back.

833
00:41:57,874 --> 00:41:59,902
Isn't that punishment enough?

834
00:42:02,378 --> 00:42:04,088
More than enough...

835
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:07,049
I owe you my life.

836
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:10,580
Thank you for saving me, Grace.

837
00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:14,383
I shall miss you.

838
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:31,900
Traveler 0029, you have been

839
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:33,402
charged with the crime of treason.

840
00:42:33,404 --> 00:42:35,069
You're on the wrong side of history,
MacLaren.

841
00:42:35,071 --> 00:42:37,772
And you have been found guilty.

842
00:42:37,774 --> 00:42:40,274
And the Director will sentence you now.

843
00:42:51,454 --> 00:42:52,553
Ahh!

844
00:43:08,103 --> 00:43:09,803
Welcome to the 21st.

845
00:43:13,976 --> 00:43:15,475
Boss?

846
00:43:16,979 --> 00:43:20,648
Make every fragment
of it unrecognizable.

847
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,620
It's over then?

848
00:43:27,622 --> 00:43:29,456
I'm not so sure.

849
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:31,425
Who killed all of them?
