1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Previously on Travelers...

2
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,000
I know.
What?

3
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,068
That you're pregnant.

4
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:06,436
<i>Your son was involved in a shooting.</i>
<i>He may not regain the use of his legs.</i>

5
00:00:06,472 --> 00:00:07,437
Ow!

6
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:08,439
Eye drops.

7
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:09,439
Synthetic compound

8
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:10,841
to help with the heroin addition.

9
00:00:10,876 --> 00:00:12,143
Jenny, by the way.

10
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,579
Jeffrey Jr. is in the hands
of Washington Family Services.

11
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,180
No! He needs to be with his mother!

12
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:18,249
Destroy the device, Walt.

13
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,017
I'm Traveler 4112.

14
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:21,385
Artificial Intelligence
isn't supposed to be capable

15
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,254
of taking a life
that isn't about to end.

16
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,322
The Director shouldn't have risked it!

17
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,656
Don't you understand?

18
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:26,657
<i>Why do you think
that they're still after you?</i>

19
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:28,392
Because they've already found me twice.

20
00:00:28,427 --> 00:00:29,760
And they'll be coming for me.

21
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:46,577
Hey. Hey.

22
00:00:46,612 --> 00:00:48,579
Thanks for picking me up.
I know you're working.

23
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:50,347
No problem.

24
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,283
Have you told Walt?

25
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,553
I haven't told anybody.

26
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:07,398
[Traveler 2150]: No.

27
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,433
Don't. I can't. I can't.

28
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:12,303
I can't. No. I can't.

29
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,740
Don't.

30
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,779
Please!

31
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:24,181
You.

32
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:26,617
You bastard, we're after you.

33
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:27,718
No.

34
00:01:27,753 --> 00:01:28,753
Please.

35
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,429
What?

36
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,598
Hit a snag in the basement.

37
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,767
Pipe leaking water.

38
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,369
Show me.

39
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,352
Get a sledge.

40
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,203
Agent MacLaren.

41
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,570
Alive and well.

42
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,205
Officer Boyd.

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,206
I'm very glad to see

44
00:02:56,241 --> 00:02:57,608
your vest worked as advertised.

45
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:59,442
Yeah, you didn't have to shoot twice.

46
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:02,479
Sorry. Professional instinct.

47
00:03:02,514 --> 00:03:04,882
He's with us now.

48
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,583
4112.

49
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,684
What the hell happened in there?

50
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,220
Exactly what happened to my team.

51
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,021
Except these four weren't rescued.

52
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:14,091
I can't imagine
who'd do something like this.

53
00:03:14,126 --> 00:03:15,225
When I last saw you,

54
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,060
you said something about
some faction in the future

55
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,362
that exists now.

56
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:19,630
The faction's been around for years.

57
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:21,431
It started as a movement in...

58
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,267
Shelter 41, I know.

59
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:24,268
Shelter 41 collapsed.

60
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:25,870
Not in the future he came from.

61
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,705
Least it was there when I left.

62
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,408
Guys, I think we need to keep
Protocol 2 in mind here.

63
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,310
Right. Well, this couldn't be
the work of the faction anyway.

64
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:34,311
Why not?

65
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:35,546
You told me, when my team went missing,

66
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:36,980
that you'd seen this kind of thing

67
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,717
happening long before
I arrived in the 21st.

68
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,485
The faction didn't exist when I left.

69
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,587
I always assumed it was the Director.

70
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,621
There's no way the Director's

71
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,423
capable of what we just saw in there.

72
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,826
Isn't letting it happen just as bad?

73
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,428
When can my team have the scene?

74
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:54,031
Forensics will be
another few hours at least.

75
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,167
But, after that, it's all yours.

76
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,209
Trev?

77
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,912
I don't want you to feel down

78
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,114
on account of this thing taking months.

79
00:04:12,351 --> 00:04:14,351
You shouldn't feel down either, Gary.

80
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:17,254
I know, I know, but I can't help it.

81
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,588
I mean...

82
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:21,058
kid, you used to fly!

83
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:23,027
If you had pressure in the pocket,

84
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,262
you would just put on those afterburners

85
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:27,999
and blow right through the defense.

86
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,802
That was a thing to watch.

87
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:36,106
Must be hard for you.

88
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,975
It is.

89
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,011
It's really hard.

90
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:45,115
You'll get through it.

91
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,850
I know you will.

92
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,353
Thanks, son.

93
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,655
Hey...

94
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,224
You too.

95
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,693
Know what?

96
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,728
This... this is good right here.

97
00:04:57,763 --> 00:04:58,863
I can walk from here.

98
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,007
Thank you.

99
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,346
You okay?

100
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:18,182
Yeah, I got it.

101
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:20,384
Thanks for the lift, Dad.

102
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,726
<i>Dr. Thomson,</i>

103
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:03,927
<i>you're needed ...in Radiology 2.</i>

104
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:06,030
<i>Dr. Thomson in Radiology 2.</i>

105
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,635
You're up next.

106
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,170
Excellent photography.

107
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,140
Dr. Barker. How are you doing today?

108
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,708
Great. You?

109
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:19,109
Oh, fine, thanks.

110
00:06:19,144 --> 00:06:22,412
Great. That's really, uh...

111
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,615
I should probably...

112
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,982
Oh. Yeah, uh...

113
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:28,352
Don't... Don't let me get in your way.

114
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,254
I was just gonna ask, uh...

115
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,258
You're busy,

116
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,392
Uh, I'll come by later.

117
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,094
Okay. Are you sure?

118
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,696
Yeah. Yeah. I've... I've got a...

119
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,497
But I will definitely...

120
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,532
Okay.

121
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,532
You too.

122
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,534
I mean, uh...

123
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,071
Right this way.

124
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,496
You don't think I would've
told you if we had a mission?

125
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,632
Well, maybe another team got one.

126
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:16,299
It's been a long time.

127
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,936
2,163 hours.

128
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,538
Not that I'm counting.

129
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:24,308
You really are an optimist.

130
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,244
Yeah. Yeah, I really am.

131
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,887
You can quit if you want.

132
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,065
Five.

133
00:07:52,037 --> 00:07:54,404
Time.

134
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,106
All right!

135
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,676
We did it!

136
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:03,780
I just thought you might want
a little bit of human contact.

137
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,482
Oh...

138
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,885
Two minutes recovery
and then we go again.

139
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
No problem.

140
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:13,990
<i>A construction site</i>

141
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:16,660
<i>in the area of Edmondville.</i>

142

<i>Four missing persons reports</i>

<i>Adena Moore is at the site now.</i>

150
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,645
<i>Adena, are you able to give us</i>

151
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,382
<i>any details on what happened there?</i>

152

<i>Well, what we're looking at now...</i>

153
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:21,925
That's the smell of death.

154
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,127
Police forensics came up with nothing.

155
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,829
Your turn.

156
00:09:40,445 --> 00:09:42,746
Trevor and I kind of
just threw this together...

157
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,483
But it should work.

158
00:09:49,454 --> 00:09:51,154
Sorry! Set too high.

159
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:53,023
We're good.

160
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,724
Hey! I got a com over here.

161
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,540
Get out of the building now!

162
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,874
Go.

163
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,210
Go!

164
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,278
Go. Go, go! Go!

165
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,209
Morning.

166
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,344
Mm.

167
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,380
Smells delicious.

168
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,620
You never cooked this much

169
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,388
when we were together before.

170
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,357
You just never liked my cooking.

171
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,527
Oh, you're definitely a better cook,
but...

172
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,798
It's like you're a different person now.

173
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,034
Nope. Same guy.

174
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,702
On the outside, maybe.

175
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,103
Yeah, and on the inside,

176
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,738
nougat and caramel.

177
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:23,874
Otherwise,

178
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,810
I am the same guy you broke up with.

179
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,247
I didn't know what I had, David.

180
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:32,483
Same guy.

181
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,951
Hey! I'm trying to give you
a compliment here, okay?

182
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:38,221
You're... you're more confident.

183
00:12:38,256 --> 00:12:39,957
I used to be able to read you,

184
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:40,990
but it feels like

185
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,126
there's so much more going on
in there now.

186
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,627
It's mysterious.

187
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,832
You don't know mysterious.

188
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:53,170
You know,
there's an ingredient in these eggs

189
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,637
that's gonna blow your mind.

190
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:58,575
You okay?

191
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,577
Yeah, I'll be fine. It'll... It'll pass.

192
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:02,078
Blair, this keeps happening.

193
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,647
Let's get you in to see a doctor.

194
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:05,248
I'm fine. Really.

195
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:06,349
Ah!

196
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,751
Okay, that's enough.

197
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,686
Let's go.

198
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,031
Hey, Carly?

199
00:13:22,066 --> 00:13:23,333
It's hard for me to focus

200
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:25,369
with you pacing around
with a gun in your hand.

201
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:27,503
Sorry.

202
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,506
It's okay.

203
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:32,008
So judging by the T.E.L.L.

204
00:13:32,043 --> 00:13:33,410
of these four host candidates,

205
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,511
I think I've figured out
who our group was.

206
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,114
A team of five just like us.

207
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,182
Which leaves one member unaccounted for.

208
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:42,218
Traveler 2192.

209
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,419
Let's find them.

210
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,555
If they're still alive.

211
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:46,757
I think I can narrow it down

212
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,191
by checking which candidates didn't die

213
00:13:48,226 --> 00:13:49,660
the day 2192 arrived.

214
00:13:50,962 --> 00:13:53,429
This com isn't telling me much,

215
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,164
other than it's been all over the place.

216
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,234
Get that com working.

217
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:00,704
Look, I'm sorry,

218
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,572
but we've already contacted
all of the victims' families.

219
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:03,573
But Jacob went missing

220
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,375
at the same time as those other people.

221
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,644
I mean, isn't it possible
that there were more victims?

222
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,713
No, there were only
four found at that location,

223
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,781
and none of them were named Jacob,
ma'am.

224
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,415
I am sorry.
Beth, Beth.

225
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,384
Let me. Let me to talk to her.

226
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,752
If you say so.

227
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:17,120
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

228
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,622
Come on in here.

229
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,090
We'll talk privately.

230
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,191
Thank you.

231
00:14:22,227 --> 00:14:25,128
Have a seat, Mrs...?

232
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,596
Ward. Sylvie.

233
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:27,630
You say

234
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,933
your husband's been
missing for some time?

235
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,468
Three and a half months.

236
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,137
That... That is a long time.

237
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:37,006
The police haven't been
able to find anything.

238
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,975
I don't even think
they're looking anymore.

239
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,477
What can you tell me about him?

240
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,646
Jacob's wonderful.

241
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,782
I mean,
we had our troubles through the years,

242
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,685
but lately,
the last year and a half or so,

243
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,053
our marriage has never been better.

244
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,121
What changed?

245
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,122
Before,

246
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,824
he was loud, he smoked like a fiend.

247
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:58,294
He wasn't health-conscious at all.

248
00:14:58,329 --> 00:15:01,164
But I always knew
that he would come around,

249
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,165
and he did.

250
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,767
Almost overnight,

251
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,169
his priorities completely realigned.

252
00:15:06,204 --> 00:15:09,172
He became more attentive,
compassionate...

253
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,173
Did you ever see him

254
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:12,709
in the company of
any of the other victims?

255
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,146
He didn't run away with another woman,

256
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,281
if that's what you're thinking.

257
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,983
That's not what I'm thinking.

258
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:23,220
I'm just wondering
if there's a connection.

259
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,821
Say, in the workplace?

260
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,523
Jacob didn't believe in bringing
his work home with him.

261
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,359
He said that was our time.

262
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:32,829
And you've had no communication
with your husband's cell phone?

263
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,797
Any activity in his bank accounts?

264
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,966
No. Nothing.

265
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:39,202
But I believe that he is still alive,
Agent MacLaren.

266
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,737
I have to.

267
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,185
Didn't you just take some of that?

268
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,387
She said to take it as needed,

269
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,456
and I<i> need to focus.</i>

270
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:03,559
Does Marcy know what's in this?

271
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:05,228
It's Marcy-approved.

272
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:06,430
Let's get back to work.

273
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:12,435
You guys there?

274
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,503
<i>Yeah, boss, what's up?</i>

275
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,572
I got a name on our fifth traveler.

276
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:16,573
Jacob Ward.

277
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:17,907
We're on it.

278
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,243
<i>Philip, I want you to put
a tap on his wife's cell phone.</i>

279
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,478
<i>Sylvie Ward.</i>

280
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,280
She just paid me a visit.
I'll text you the address.

281
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,582
Will do, boss.

282
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,052
Shit!

283
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,688
I gotta go.

284
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,297
I'm sure Carly
will be here any minute now.

285
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,699
Her new job's...

286
00:16:42,734 --> 00:16:44,134
been a little crazy.

287
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,770
In the meantime, how are you doing?

288
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,472
Fine.

289
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,074
Lot of change in your life.

290
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,142
How's that going?

291
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:54,544
Ah, that's all good.

292
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,246
Just living through the changes.

293
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,047
When Carly's here,

294
00:16:58,082 --> 00:16:59,249
I sometimes get the impression

295
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,618
that you're going out
of your way to agree with her.

296
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,487
Might be useful to use this time,

297
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,389
while we have it, to talk about you.

298
00:17:06,424 --> 00:17:08,358
Ahem.

299
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,827
Yeah, I can do that.

300
00:17:10,862 --> 00:17:13,396
Okay.

301
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,265
Do that.

302
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,302
How much do you know about guilt?

303
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,904
I am so sorry I'm late.

304
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,105
Hey... there she is!

305
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,107
Traffic was just...

306
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:25,675
Ahh!

307
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,410
Well, you're here now.

308
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:28,912
Ahem. So...

309
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:30,546
big week for you two.

310
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:33,482
Your final custody assessment from CPS.

311
00:17:33,518 --> 00:17:35,118
How are the two of you feeling?

312
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:37,554
Good.

313
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:38,621
Yeah, it's really good.

314
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,822
Really good.

315
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,324
That's good.

316
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,133
Marce!

317
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,435
Hi!

318
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,170
I've been looking everywhere for you.

319
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:56,606
Uh, is everything all right?

320
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:58,541
Yeah.

321
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:00,043
Everything's fine.

322
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,912
No. Um...

323
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:05,548
I got back together with... with Blair.

324
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,549
And, um...

325
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,017
Good for you.

326
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,021
I wasn't looking for you
to tell you that,

327
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,522
but I think there might be
something wrong with her.

328
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:15,825
Uh, well, did you take her to admitting?

329
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,093
Yeah, see, that was the original plan,

330
00:18:17,128 --> 00:18:19,362
but then I learned
she doesn't have insurance.

331
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:22,198
Um... But she's been having
these harsh stomach pains

332
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,499
for over a week now,

333
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,035
and I'm worried that if
she doesn't get it looked at...

334
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,371
David, I...
I'm just an x-ray technician.

335
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:31,908
I think we both know
that that's not true.

336
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:35,112
Besides, I think an x-ray's
exactly what she does need.

337
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:38,014
Right. Uh...

338
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,283
Bring her to imaging in block "C".

339
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:43,353
Thank you.

340
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,459
You two are really gonna hit it off.

341
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,369
Hey, Boss.

342
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,203
Hey. What have you got?

343
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,738
You were right. Our man, Jacob,

344
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,040
is definitely our missing traveler.

345
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,576
He went off the grid sometime mid-May.

346
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:08,244
If he's still out there,
he's good at hiding.

347
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,080
Any action on the wife's cell?

348
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,415
There's already a tap on her line.

349
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,484
Someone else is watching her besides us.

350
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,655
Trevor, you got that com working yet?

351
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:21,358
Ready when you are.

352
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,561
Hello?

353
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,163
This is Traveler 3468.

354
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,465
2192, are you there?

355
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,834
<i>How did you get on this channel?</i>

356
00:19:33,304 --> 00:19:34,904
I'm sure you've heard by now...

357
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,539
the rest of your team is dead.

358
00:19:36,574 --> 00:19:38,708
We found this com at the crime scene.

359
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,042
We want to help.

360
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,378
<i>Is your mission
from the Director to assist me?</i>

361
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:44,114
No. But my team was captured,

362
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,115
the same as yours.

363
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,650
I think it's important that...

364
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,385
<i>Then stand down!</i>

365
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,686
Do you have a tap
on your wife's cell phone?

366
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:52,522
<i>What?</i>

367
00:19:52,557 --> 00:19:54,290
Someone besides us
is tracking your wife.

368
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,458
Is it you?

369
00:19:57,662 --> 00:19:59,362
Jacob?

370
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:00,363
He's still there.

371
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,931
The signal's still strong.

372
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,666
He's cutting out his com.

373
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:07,337
Do not remove your com! Jacob!

374
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,604
Your wife is in trouble!

375
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,773
Jacob!

376
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,843
We lost him.

377
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,977
Okay.

378
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,080
Keep monitoring her phone.

379
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:19,416
I think I know where he's going.

380
00:20:27,258 --> 00:20:29,058
Hi.

381
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,561
You found something, didn't you?

382
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:34,096
Uh...

383
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,899
The scans did show
a foreign mass in her stomach.

384
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,301
Oh, God, here we go.

385
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:39,903
I'm afraid to even guess at what...

386
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,771
You don't have to.

387
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,207
It's cotton balls.

388
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,243
Cotton balls?

389
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,646
How could she possibly have ingested...

390
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,247
It's a weight-loss thing...

391
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:53,282
It's supposed to make you feel fuller.

392
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,283
I don't know.

393
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:55,985
David,
I don't think that you realize how...

394
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,986
I know.

395
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:57,987
And not to mention

396
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,322
unbelievably dangerous.

397
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:00,457
I mean,
she's lucky she didn't eat enough

398
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,457
to cause an obstruction.

399
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:04,494
Yeah, that's what happened last time.

400
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,497
All right. Uh...

401
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,500
We'll get her stomach pumped
and she'll be on her way,

402
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,103
but you cannot let her...

403
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,470
I know, I know.

404
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:15,739
I know.

405
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,173
I'll talk to her.

406
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,510
Um...

407
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:26,749
Thank you.

408
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,885
You're welcome.

409
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,320
Agent MacLaren. Is there news?

410
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:07,356
Actually,
I was hoping Jacob had contacted you.

411
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,525
Contacted? I haven't heard a thing.

412
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,193
Mind if I come in?
Is everything all right?

413
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,195
I hope so.

414
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,196
I just have a few more questions.

415
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,697
I just... I'm late for an appointment.

416
00:22:14,732 --> 00:22:17,567
Maybe I could drop by your office later?

417
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,003
How did you break this?

418
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,171
I told you to leave me alone!

419
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:23,172
Jacob!

420
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:24,707
I'm here to help you!
Jacob!

421
00:22:24,742 --> 00:22:26,743
He's running! Back stairs!

422
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,120
Jacob!

423
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,024
Jacob!

424
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:47,597
You all right?

425
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:55,004
Stop it! I'm Traveler 3465.

426
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,605
We're here to help you.

427
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:59,108
And you're making that
awfully goddamn difficult.

428
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,044
You people have no idea what
you're getting yourselves into!

429
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,546
Traveler teams from all over the world

430
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,881
are being abducted and tortured.

431
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:06,416
We know.

432
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:07,583
The Director assigned us

433
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:09,051
to investigate their disappearances,

434
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:11,187
but they found us before we could...

435
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,060
It's bad.

436
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:20,263
Marcy, drop what you're doing.
Get back to Ops.

437
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,998
You got a patient.

438
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,439
Keep your eyes open.
We're getting you to our medic.

439
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:31,107
Call Sylvie.

440
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:32,442
You need to tell us what you know.

441
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,643
What did your team find out?
Who's behind this?

442
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,446
Whoever it is...

443
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:38,047
they cover their tracks.

444
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,983
We do know that the buildings...

445
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:43,652
every one Travelers were taken to,

446
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,288
all... all a-around the world...

447
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:49,825
What about the buildings?

448
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,694
They're owned by numbered companies.

449
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:53,396
Sh-Sh... Shells...

450
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,165
but under one conglomerate.

451
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,333
Give us a name, Jacob!

452
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:01,805
Jacob! Jacob!

453
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,503
His lung's collapsed.
We need to re-inflate it.

454
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:34,971
Carly?

455
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:55,325
He needs shock.

456
00:24:59,097 --> 00:25:00,062
Charge?

457
00:25:00,097 --> 00:25:01,865
Mm-hmm.

458
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,000
Clear.

459
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,170
Charge again.

460
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,538
Clear.

461
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:18,281
He's gone.

462
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,161
Hello?

463
00:25:32,196 --> 00:25:33,296
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

464
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,264
What a total surprise.

465
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:36,499
Funny.

466
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:37,734
Hey, before I drop by tonight,

467
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:38,901
you want me to stop at the grocery store

468
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,403
and pick up anything special,
craving-wise?

469
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:42,405
<i>Oh...</i>

470
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,174
Um... Yes!

471
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,376
Some kind of smoked meat.

472
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,878
Meat.

473
00:25:48,913 --> 00:25:49,979
<i>I need the iron!</i>

474
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:51,581
What's the smoke for?

475
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,816
Nobody craves broccoli, Grant.

476
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:55,150
You're the one who offered.

477
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:56,585
Kat, someone's on the other line.

478
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:57,586
I'll call you back.

479
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,755
Mm-hmm. Okay.

480
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,756
MacLaren.

481
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:02,091
<i>Okay, so, the sole owner</i>

482
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:03,459
of the company that owns that building

483
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:04,760
is Vincent Ingram.

484
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:07,062
He's got an estate
about an hour from downtown.

485
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,632
I let one of his people know
that you were on your way.

486
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:12,968
Okay, great. Thanks, Beth.
Text me the address.

487
00:26:13,003 --> 00:26:14,436
Just did.

488
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,474
Hi.

489
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:21,010
Have you seen my eye drops?

490
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:22,745
Nope.

491
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,146
I just got here.

492
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:25,214
You were the last person

493
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:27,383
who had them yesterday,
when we were working.

494
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:30,152
I didn't take your drops, Philip. Relax.

495
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:31,687
What's that supposed to mean?

496
00:26:31,722 --> 00:26:32,989
Uh...

497
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:35,058
look around.

498
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,927
Just give them back.

499
00:26:37,962 --> 00:26:39,862
What's going on, man?

500
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,497
I know you're trying to monitor me.

501
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,299
I can take care of myself,

502
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,967
so just back off

503
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,970
and give me back my drops.

504
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,411
Here.

505
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:57,780
Ahem.

506
00:26:57,815 --> 00:26:58,781
Jeez.

507
00:26:58,816 --> 00:27:00,650
Ahem.

508
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,218
It's a good thing

509
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,487
these are helping with your addiction,
huh?

510
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:12,328
Jeez.

511
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,564
<i>Hey. This is Marcy. Leave a message.</i>

512
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,767
Hey, Marce...y.

513
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,668
Uh, I just wanted to say thanks again

514
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:21,170
for your help with Blair.

515
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:24,540
Uh, I really appreciate it,
and she's doing better, so...

516
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:25,574
Um...

517
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:28,544
Anyway, uh,
I was hoping that you could, uh,

518
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,380
you could join me...

519
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,047
me and Blair, for dinner tonight,

520
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,716
as a way to say thank you.

521
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:36,051
<i>Uh, so if you're free,
that would be great,</i>

522
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,686
<i>to see you.</i>

523
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:38,854
<i>I know I just saw you,</i>

524
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,522
<i>but it would be...</i>

525
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,959
<i>it'd great to see you again.</i>

526
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:46,696
<i>I do, like, a fish dish now.</i>

527
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:48,731
<i>Uh, "Branzini."</i>

528
00:27:48,766 --> 00:27:52,435
<i>I know you like white fish
and all those Omega-3s.</i>

529
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,070
No cotton balls, I promise.

530
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,340
Anyway, uh...

531
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,877
All this to say I hope you can join me.

532
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,444
Us...

533
00:28:02,479 --> 00:28:05,081
I mean,
because Blair will be there, too.

534
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,782
And you...

535
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:08,350
I hope.

536
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,121
Oh, for God's sakes.

537
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,460
But we've grown up a lot.

538
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:20,263
And Carly's an amazing woman,

539
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:23,332
and I'm thankful every day
that she's a part of my life.

540
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:27,269
How's your landscaping job going?

541
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,605
Still great.

542
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,873
I see that neither of you

543
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:32,608
have missed a session
with your counselor.

544
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:33,609
How have they been going?

545
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:35,377
Very helpful.
Good, yeah. Very.

546
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,413
Tell me how.

547
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,887
Well, I was...

548
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:47,790
angry.

549
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,491
And hurt.

550
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:52,561
But, by talking things through,

551
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,498
we found out that we were both angry.

552
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,133
We just didn't have
as much to be mad about

553
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,469
as we thought we did.

554
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,272
The counseling has
helped me forgive Jeff.

555
00:29:03,307 --> 00:29:06,208
And to not let the past stop me

556
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,845
from seeing who he is now.

557
00:29:15,052 --> 00:29:16,251
I have to admit,

558
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,721
you're doing very well
at keeping up the act.

559
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,292
Oh, please.
I've been doing this a long time.

560
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:24,493
You can't fool me.

561
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,661
Jacqueline...

562
00:29:25,696 --> 00:29:27,796
But it's not necessarily a bad thing.

563
00:29:27,831 --> 00:29:29,298
It means you want to try.

564
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,866
Most marriages include

565
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:33,603
at least a little bit of faking it,
trust me.

566
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,871
I can see how much this means
to the both of you,

567
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,706
and how committed you are.

568
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:41,110
You may not ever be great spouses,

569
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:42,778
but...

570
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:45,848
I think you could be good parents.

571
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:56,192
This way.

572
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:03,633
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

573
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,668
My office called.

574
00:30:54,952 --> 00:30:58,554
I apologize for the conditions
of entry into my house.

575
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,422
Please, don't take it personally.

576
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:02,091
That's all right, Mr. Ingram.

577
00:31:02,126 --> 00:31:04,560
Special Agent MacLaren.

578
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,029
Have we ever met, Agent MacLaren?

579
00:31:07,064 --> 00:31:08,431
Well, I usually remember

580
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,933
the people who decline to shake my hand.

581
00:31:10,968 --> 00:31:12,801
How do you close your business deals?

582
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,703
Through a legal representative.

583
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,739
And a large transfer of money.

584
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,107
I'm investigating the four bodies

585
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:20,276
that were found in the basement

586
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:22,244
of the building at 46 Henderson Avenue.

587
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,713
Why are you speaking to me?

588
00:31:23,748 --> 00:31:26,048
One of your companies owns the property.

589
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,851
I suppose, on paper,
that's technically true,

590
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,820
though I think the company
that leased it from me

591
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:32,420
would be better able to provide you

592
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:34,590
with the day-to-day operations.

593
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:35,991
Have you spoken to them?

594
00:31:36,026 --> 00:31:37,293
Not yet.

595
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,395
If an employee of a Microsoft store

596
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,264
was involved in a criminal act,
even a serious one,

597
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:45,234
would most FBI agents think
to question Bill Gates?

598
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,401
The four victims

599
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,203
were tortured extensively

600
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,338
and over an extended period of time,

601
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:52,174
so I hope you won't take it personally

602
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,410
if I'm being thorough.

603
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:57,012
Well,
I don't know how much use I can be.

604
00:31:57,047 --> 00:31:59,281
I've never seen the building
or stepped foot inside,

605
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,950
and I operate
all of my business remotely.

606
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:03,819
I never leave this house.

607
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:05,353
Never?

608
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:08,190
My therapist encourages me to be blunt.

609
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:10,726
I'm agoraphobic, germophobic,

610
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:13,128
and I don't like personal contact.

611
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:14,963
Well,
I'm very sorry that I have to be here.

612
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,531
You don't.

613
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,301
You're naturally curious
about the wealthy recluse,

614
00:32:19,336 --> 00:32:21,570
and your badge gets you in my door.

615
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,338
That is blunt.

616
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:26,175
Please, ask your question
and get this over with.

617
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,444
You founded

618
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:31,913
one of the leading
digital security firms.

619
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,616
I am curious,

620
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,083
why are you so strict

621
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,886
about outside electronics in your home?

622
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:39,321
Well, despite the best precautions,

623
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:40,322
Agent MacLaren,

624
00:32:40,357 --> 00:32:42,458
privacy is an illusion.

625
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,660
With cameras and microphones

626
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,496
built into every personal device...

627
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:50,465
My therapist says I'm paranoid,

628
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,034
but I think it's human nature

629
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:53,302
for us to do anything

630
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:56,071
to protect ourselves and our families.

631
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:57,406
Dad?

632
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,074
I'm just finishing up a meeting.

633
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:00,076
Go...

634
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,076
put your coat on.

635
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:04,080
I'll be out there shortly.

636
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,685
I try to reserve

637
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,921
a couple of hours every day
to play with my son.

638
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:13,588
Do you have children?

639
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:15,123
No.

640
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,225
Well, I'm sure

641
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,294
there's still time
for you and your wife.

642
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,733
I remember now!

643
00:33:24,768 --> 00:33:28,838
We met five years ago
at a charity event.

644
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,940
It was before my condition
became so debilitating.

645
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:33,943
You were there with your wife...

646
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:35,344
Kathryn.

647
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:38,380
Sorry... didn't recognize you.

648
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,050
A stunning woman, if I remember it.

649
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,285
With dark hair,
and a wonderful dance partner.

650
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,887
In your shoes,

651
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,288
I would never have let a single soul

652
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:49,258
steal a dance from her.

653
00:33:49,293 --> 00:33:51,627
Please send her my regards.

654
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,797
That is, if our business is concluded.

655
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,599
It is.

656
00:33:57,635 --> 00:34:00,102
For now. Thanks for your time.

657
00:34:01,905 --> 00:34:03,239
Happy hunting.

658
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,610
The event would've been five years ago.

659
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,213
Liberty Banquet Hall.

660
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:12,648
Looks fancy.

661
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,082
I have no idea,

662
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:15,650
but I'd be on the guest list.

663
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:18,153
"MacLaren plus guest."

664
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:21,123
That's you.

665
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,525
Yeah.

666
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,794
Okay. Look for Vincent Ingram.

667
00:34:32,302 --> 00:34:33,635
There's no sign he was there.

668
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,070
Doesn't mean he wasn't.

669
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,038
Can you hack into his private server?

670
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,674
You know it.

671
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,043
How you doing? What's that? What's that?

672
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,646
Jeff!

673
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:45,847
We did it.

674
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:47,949
We deserve to celebrate. You...

675
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,018
deserve...

676
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,520
to celebrate.

677
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:52,955
You made a promise.

678
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,823
A couple hours ago, we didn't know

679
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,159
if we ever were going
to see our son again.

680
00:34:58,195 --> 00:35:00,329
Come on,
I'm just trying to say thank you.

681
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,208
Hey, big boy!

682
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:14,776
Hey!

683
00:35:14,811 --> 00:35:16,879
Come here. Come here.

684
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:21,683
I miss you.

685
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:28,624
Redundancy number six?

686
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:31,560
That's just excessive.

687
00:35:31,595 --> 00:35:32,728
Just try again.

688
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,896
The Director didn't order us
to investigate this guy.

689
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,732
We're breaking Protocol 5 by doing this.

690
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,034
As far as I'm concerned,
this falls under Protocol 1...

691
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:40,402
The mission comes first.

692
00:35:40,437 --> 00:35:42,470
The whole grand plan's in jeopardy

693
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:44,006
if we can't stop teams from being taken!

694
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,407
Now,
maybe this guy didn't pull the trigger,

695
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,876
but if he's involved in any way...

696
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,044
He froze me out.

697
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,713
That's redundancy number 7.

698
00:35:51,748 --> 00:35:53,415
I thought you said you could do this!

699
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,283
There's a reason why
he's the best in the 21st.

700
00:35:55,318 --> 00:35:56,484
Shouldn't you be the best,

701
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,954
considering the century you come from?

702
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:00,689
Hey, look.

703
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,625
Yelling at it worked.

704
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:22,211
Oh, my God.

705
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:27,550
Wow.

706
00:36:30,287 --> 00:36:32,420
You look...

707
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,690
I can't even finish my sentence.

708
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,926
That seems to be going around.

709
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:41,730
Hi.

710
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:43,832
Uh, Blair just texted

711
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,967
that she's running a little late,

712
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,269
but the fish is ready,
so if you want to eat,

713
00:36:47,304 --> 00:36:48,604
we could eat.

714
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,105
Uh, let's wait.

715
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,174
Yeah, you know, we probably should.

716
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,177
I wasn't, uh...

717
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,580
I wasn't sure if you were
actually gonna come.

718
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,583
Well, you invited me.

719
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:04,252
How's your therapy been going?

720
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,054
No more panic attacks.

721
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:08,724
I still find it hard to fall asleep

722
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:10,892
when I'm in bed with Blair, but...

723
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:13,062
You know, I didn't mean it like that.

724
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:15,397
Not like we don't, we do,

725
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,531
but just, you know...

726
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,401
you know, not excessively,
just a normal frequency.

727
00:37:19,436 --> 00:37:21,737
Not like...

728
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:23,271
What was I talking about?

729
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:24,639
How you can't sleep.

730
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:25,641
Right!

731
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:28,143
Uh, she snores.

732
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,350
Ahem.

733
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,851
Hey...

734
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,753
would you do something for me?

735
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:40,456
Anything.

736
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:43,459
Tell me about me.

737
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,861
Like, things you don't remember, or...?

738
00:37:47,631 --> 00:37:50,332
Okay, um...

739
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,002
I used to call you "Batgirl,"

740
00:37:54,037 --> 00:37:56,338
from you running off at all hours,

741
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,772
fighting crime.

742
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,475
Uh...

743
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,476
you liked listening to country music.

744
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:03,011
Which country?

745
00:38:03,046 --> 00:38:06,648
No, it's a... it's a genre.

746
00:38:06,683 --> 00:38:09,084
Um, you like honey in your tea,
but not...

747
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,853
No, I mean, uh, what I was like.

748
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:13,455
Oh. Okay.

749
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,189
Um...

750
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:16,625
stubborn.

751
00:38:17,995 --> 00:38:19,261
You drove me crazy sometimes.

752
00:38:19,296 --> 00:38:21,396
I'm not gonna lie to you.

753
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:23,365
Uh... fierce.

754
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,002
Little yell-y, now and then.

755
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:30,439
Generally... amazing.

756
00:38:31,841 --> 00:38:35,110
I'm not really sure
that's what I'm asking.

757
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:36,844
Um...

758
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,114
I'm just trying to find
the missing pieces.

759
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:42,318
All I tell you is what you did to me.

760
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:46,020
How I felt

761
00:38:46,056 --> 00:38:48,590
whenever you would walk
through the door...

762
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:52,328
every time.

763
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:56,331
Like butterflies...

764
00:38:56,366 --> 00:38:58,200
that feeling in your stomach.

765
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,237
Even more so when you'd go out again.

766
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,044
Someone like you

767
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,747
does not happen to someone like me.

768
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:16,385
And I know that doesn't
answer your question

769
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,719
and I know that you're just
trying to remember

770
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,421
the missing pieces, but...

771
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:23,391
Maybe someone is best defined

772
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:25,594
by how they affect
the people around them.

773
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:30,933
I think I just made that up,
but I think it may be true.

774
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,573
Hey, guys.

775
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,776
Um, I'm so sorry I'm late.

776
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:42,944
That's okay. We were just, uh...

777
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:44,045
<i>Marcy, Carly...</i>

778
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,482
<i>I need you back at Ops, right now.</i>

779
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:50,786
Um, I actually need to go,
something just came up.

780
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:52,620
Oh. No, really?

781
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,755
You don't need to...

782
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:54,756
I do.

783
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:57,092
Um, thank you for the wine.

784
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,229
Bye.

785
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:10,138
There's a file for each of us.

786
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:12,307
I can't believe we found him.

787
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:15,811
Open mine.

788
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,934
We take him tonight.

789
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,570
Before another Traveler dies.

790
00:40:42,605 --> 00:40:44,540
You're fucking right we do.

791
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:46,908
Let's gear up.

792
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:52,680
Okay, we go in quiet and fast.

793
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:53,982
Kill him and get out.

794
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:55,250
Boss, I don't agree with this.

795
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:57,151
Yeah? Well, we're going to need you.

796
00:40:57,187 --> 00:40:58,687
How about you, Philip?

797
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,056
Oh, I'm in.

798
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,692
All right,
there are four armed guards outside.

799
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,194
Here, here, here, and here.

800
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,761
I don't know how many staff inside.

801
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:07,795
All right.

802
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:09,531
Let's park behind this tree-line

803
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:10,666
and proceed on foot.

804
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:12,100
And, after lunch,

805
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:14,102
Miss Henry let me read
from<i> The Chrysalids</i>.

806
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,704
She said I had
a very impressive vocabulary.

807
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,973
Go get it!

808
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,474
Good for you.

809
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:22,578
Come on. Come on, boy.

810
00:41:48,872 --> 00:41:50,672
Taylor?

811
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:52,173
Good boy. Good boy. Come on.

812
00:41:52,208 --> 00:41:54,076
Taylor!

813
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:56,211
Not so far. Not so far!

814
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:58,146
Come on.

815
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,249
Traveler 001...

816
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:05,387
Traveler 3468, you are off-mission.

817
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,389
Stop your pursuit of Traveler 3468

818
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:08,923
and his team immediately.

819
00:42:08,959 --> 00:42:11,960
Stand down immediately
or face repercussions.

820
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,697
Where's my mom?

821
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,502
Dad? What's wrong?

822
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:21,770
Come back inside.

823
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,337
Quickly. Quickly!

824
00:42:23,373 --> 00:42:25,006
It's all right, sweetheart.

825
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,841
I'm a policeman.

826
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,876
Boss?

827
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,077
What do we do?

828
00:42:34,717 --> 00:42:37,085
Taylor and I are leaving tonight.

829
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,254
We won't be returning.

830
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:42,190
Stand down.

831
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:43,391
What?

832
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:45,160
The Director must have a reason.

833
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,761
The Director is the one
who wanted him found!

834
00:42:46,796 --> 00:42:48,630
We found him! Let's finish it!

835
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:50,799
It's not our mission.

836
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,634
Not tonight.

837
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,105
Come on, sweetheart. Let's get you home.

838
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:03,778
Come on.

839
00:43:03,813 --> 00:43:05,847
Do you know your address?
