1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,497
Previously on Travelers.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:02,850
Can you feel that?

3
00:00:02,852 --> 00:00:05,486
The latest ultrasound looks good.

4
00:00:05,488 --> 00:00:07,120
You and the baby are fine.

5
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:08,656
You got three races out of five

6
00:00:08,658 --> 00:00:09,692
with those stupid odds.

7
00:00:09,892 --> 00:00:10,927
How did that happen?

8
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,596
The timeline has changed a lot.

9
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:14,397
We are in serious financial trouble.

10
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:16,132
What happened
to we're all on the same side?

11
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:17,634
I don't want to be in the same room.

12
00:00:17,636 --> 00:00:19,069
I should be leading this team.

13
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:19,903
Do we have a problem?

14
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:20,904
No.

15
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:22,405
FBI! Show me your hands!

16
00:00:22,407 --> 00:00:24,540
Son of a bitch.

17
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:25,441
Sergeant Richard Hall,

18
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:26,309
you have the right to remain silent.

19
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,310
Anything you say

20
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:29,445
can and will be used against you...

21
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,980
First time?

22
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:58,235
Yeah. You?

23
00:00:58,237 --> 00:00:59,500
Second.

24
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:02,271
Third for him.

25
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,687
Good evening, Historians.

26
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,523
Welcome to Regional Update 4.

27
00:01:14,525 --> 00:01:17,125
I'm Traveler A-26
of the archivist program.

28
00:01:17,127 --> 00:01:18,564
If this is your first time,

29
00:01:18,566 --> 00:01:19,738
please take a moment

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,520
to look inside the bag
you were provided on the way in.

31
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:27,357
The two green pills

32
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:29,859
are to be taken immediately
following the update.

33
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:30,993
It's important

34
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:33,863
that we restore any chemical
imbalances in the brain.

35
00:01:33,865 --> 00:01:37,380
The yellow pills
you will need going forward.

36
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:39,468
From time to time,

37
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,770
you may perceive
what we call "projections..."

38
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:43,206
visual manifestations

39
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:46,580
of one or more alternate timelines...

40
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:48,010
an unavoidable side-effect

41
00:01:48,012 --> 00:01:50,313
of memory not acquired
by conventional means.

42
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,114
The yellow pills

43
00:01:53,116 --> 00:01:55,217
will help to focus
your sensory perception

44
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:57,386
on one timeline at a time.

45
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:58,659
When you run out,

46
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,223
call this number to arrange for more.

47
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,660
Get that?

48
00:02:03,227 --> 00:02:04,195
Yeah.

49
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,294
Next, Protocol 2H...

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,632
the update is not to be
discussed with anyone.

51
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:12,968
Ever.

52
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,102
Do not break this protocol.

53
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:16,637
This update will include
historical information

54
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,341
relevant to your team's role
in the Grand Plan,

55
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:22,244
including potential candidates,
investments, etc.

56
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,346
But by its very nature,

57
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:27,682
your update may also include
historical information

58
00:02:27,684 --> 00:02:30,885
about your team members, loved ones.

59
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:32,086
About you.

60
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:34,689
This is a burden
you will have to carry with you

61
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:36,524
until the day you die...

62
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:38,493
a date which, for obvious reasons,

63
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:40,428
will be omitted from your update.

64
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:43,663
Any questions?

65
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:47,660
Let's begin.

66
00:02:51,073 --> 00:02:52,706
Historians.

67
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,775
Open memory chain 1A.

68
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,303
Hey. I made breakfast.

69
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:12,980
I don't wanna be late.

70
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,460
Hey, come on, Carly.

71
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,580
Take five minutes.

72
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,927
Grant! They chose me!

73
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,529
Who?

74
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,131
The Pattersons.

75
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:28,487
Uh...

76
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:30,501
You know, the restaurant owners.

77
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,502
Jill...

78
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,304
Jill. Right.

79
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,672
This means what exactly?

80
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,475
That I will be designing
their new restaurant

81
00:04:38,477 --> 00:04:39,610
with a brand-new baby.

82
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,478
Well, you'll have my help with the baby.

83
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,981
I can't take a job
that I don't have time to do...

84
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:45,616
Kat... We'll figure it out.

85
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,193
So I should say yes?
Do you want to say yes?

86
00:04:48,195 --> 00:04:49,452
Yes. Then yes.

87
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:52,220
Okay.

88
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,657
I'll let them know.

89
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,962
Nice work.

90
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:10,540
Hey, guys.

91
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:11,541
Hey.

92
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,209
What's the mission?

93
00:05:15,246 --> 00:05:16,178
I got a messenger

94
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,680
with lotto numbers yesterday.

95
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:18,748
Director must've seen

96
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,382
we're in a bit of a financial hole

97
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:21,517
and decided to step up.

98
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,585
Good.

99
00:05:22,587 --> 00:05:24,246
I obviously can't win any more lotteries

100
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:25,521
without attracting undo attention,

101
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:27,189
so...

102
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,990
you won 86k

103
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:30,692
on the super draw last night...

104
00:05:30,694 --> 00:05:31,693
And these numbers

105
00:05:31,695 --> 00:05:33,028
on the mega ball for tonight

106
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,063
will get you 62.

107
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:37,500
$62 doesn't sound like very much.

108
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,702
$62,000.

109
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:42,171
Oh, good.

110
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:44,539
You both get 6 numbers out of 7.

111
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,274
Why don't we just win
7 out of 7 and we're covered?

112
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:47,761
Because historically,

113
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:49,077
someone else is supposed
to win the big one

114
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,078
and completely ruin their lives.

115
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,507
What about me?

116
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:53,214
You are too young to gamble.

117
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:55,383
An excellent example of irony.

118
00:05:57,454 --> 00:05:59,187
So will that get us out of the hole?

119
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:00,521
Not even close.

120
00:06:00,523 --> 00:06:01,789
This is seed money.

121
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,924
But I can quadruple it with horse races

122
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:04,925
and use those earnings

123
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:06,527
to create something
far more substantial.

124
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:08,196
How does that even work

125
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:10,264
if the historical record has changed?

126
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,701
The messenger gave me
very detailed instructions.

127
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,570
We're good.

128
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:16,982
Congratulations, you guys!

129
00:06:16,984 --> 00:06:18,739
Sweet.
Thanks.

130
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:57,343
So?

131
00:06:57,345 --> 00:06:58,344
What did you think?

132
00:06:58,346 --> 00:07:00,013
I liked it. It's like therapy.

133
00:07:00,015 --> 00:07:02,081
Yeah. That's the idea.

134
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,650
We should do it more often.

135
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:05,451
I'm in.

136
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:06,452
Hey, do you know

137
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:07,453
if there's a store around here anywhere?

138
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:10,623
So do I go for the $3.00 water,

139
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:13,925
the luxurious $5.00 bottle of water,

140
00:07:13,927 --> 00:07:17,060
or the suspiciously-underpriced
99-cent water?

141
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:22,168
You're buying a lottery ticket?

142
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,334
Mm-hmm.

143
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:24,770
Thanks.

144
00:07:24,772 --> 00:07:26,471
I buy one once in a while

145
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:29,474
when the jackpot gets
insanely big like this one.

146
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:30,809
I don't know why.

147
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:33,945
I mean,
any size jackpot would change my life.

148
00:07:34,948 --> 00:07:36,782
I always play my same lucky numbers.

149
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,616
Yeah. Do you ever win?

150
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,785
Nope.

151
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:48,341
Thank you.

152
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,335
Thanks.

153
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,980
What's up?

154
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:11,900
Why'd you stop playing?

155
00:08:13,252 --> 00:08:15,085
Same reason you did.

156
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:16,286
You got a concussion, too?

157
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:17,921
Whatever, Trevor.

158
00:08:17,923 --> 00:08:20,324
Whoa, Kyle!

159
00:08:20,326 --> 00:08:21,325
Don't try to tell me

160
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:22,726
that you don't remember
what he did to us

161
00:08:22,728 --> 00:08:24,325
because of your concussions.

162
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:27,197
Nobody forgets shit like that.

163
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,467
Maybe I just don't like
to think about it...

164
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:42,300
Hey. Can I help you?

165
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:45,414
No, I don't need any help.

166
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,082
Do you need any help?

167
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:48,117
I'm good.

168
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,619
Yeah, no, we're good.

169
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:51,554
Who's your friend?

170
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:52,455
Kyle.

171
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:54,123
Well, hello, Kyle. Nice to meet you.

172
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,960
You know, Trevor and us, we...
we go way, way back.

173
00:08:57,962 --> 00:09:01,264
I'm Hall. This is my associate, Luca.

174
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:03,531
Hey.

175
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:05,234
Hey, Trevor, I'm gonna go.

176
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:06,735
I'll catch up with you later.

177
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,075
Boss, it's me.

178
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,243
What's up?

179
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:16,011
Hall and Luca got out of prison early.

180
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:18,546
How do you know?

181
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:20,114
Because I'm standing
right in front of 'em.

182
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:21,616
They're parked outside the school.

183
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:24,152
I guess they don't know
I don't like being watched.

184
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:25,587
Tough guy. I love it!

185
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,589
Do me a favor...

186
00:09:27,591 --> 00:09:29,540
Give my regards to the boy scout.

187
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:41,903
They just drove off.

188
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:43,771
What was that about? What'd he say?

189
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:44,806
Nothing.

190
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:46,607
Just thought you should know.

191
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:49,343
Thanks for the heads up.

192
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:12,832
Hey, Philip.

193
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:15,468
Got your winnings.

194
00:10:16,938 --> 00:10:19,220
Hopefully,
we get more messengers like that.

195
00:10:23,777 --> 00:10:24,776
Where's the rest of it?

196
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:26,140
I took some.

197
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:29,441
I need to invest that.

198
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:30,839
Well, turns out

199
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:31,817
"baby needs a new pair of shoes"

200
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:33,586
isn't just a saying.

201
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:35,687
And my van need a new transmission.

202
00:10:36,976 --> 00:10:38,442
Okay.

203
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:40,358
I can make it work.

204
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,300
How is all that going, by the way?

205
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:45,995
You and Jeff and the baby?

206
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:48,968
Is it workin' out?

207
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,891
It's fine. Why?

208
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:52,463
I don't know, just asking.

209
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:53,845
Asking what exactly?

210
00:10:53,847 --> 00:10:57,260
Uh... if things were okay at home?

211
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,082
Are you developing a thing for me?

212
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,540
No!

213
00:11:03,086 --> 00:11:04,519
I just haven't...

214
00:11:04,521 --> 00:11:06,054
heard you talk about that in a while,
and...

215
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:07,055
It's all good.

216
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:08,489
Great.

217
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:14,382
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I think you're very attractive.

218
00:11:20,636 --> 00:11:21,635
This is weird.

219
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:22,603
I agree.

220
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:23,571
I'm going to go.

221
00:11:23,573 --> 00:11:24,572
Okay.

222
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:25,873
Thanks for the cash.

223
00:11:39,856 --> 00:11:41,488
Atta boy.

224
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,789
Come on, Kyle.

225
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:54,020
Come on, Kyle! One, two.

226
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:55,914
Atta boy.

227
00:11:57,206 --> 00:11:58,204
Atta boy!

228
00:11:58,206 --> 00:12:00,306
Way to work out some of that aggression.

229
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:01,541
Come on, let's get some water.

230
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:03,608
Come on, let's keep going.

231
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,566
Have a drink. Come on.

232
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:10,740
Let's talk a bit.

233
00:12:10,953 --> 00:12:12,018
Leave it alone.

234
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,940
The old man can't touch us anymore.

235
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,388
Come on.

236
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,889
One, two, one, two.

237
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,893
One, two.

238
00:12:22,863 --> 00:12:25,160
One, two. One, two.

239
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:27,866
Why haven't you told anybody?

240
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:29,535
Why haven't you?

241
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:31,420
We're not talkin' about me.

242
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:36,708
He said if I let him...
One, two.

243
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,709
Come on, come on. One, two.

244
00:12:37,711 --> 00:12:39,260
He'd take care of me!

245
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:41,553
Set me up.

246
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,114
With scholarships and shit...

247
00:12:43,116 --> 00:12:44,115
One, two.

248
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:50,220
What did he promise you, hmm?

249
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,591
The same.

250
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:57,128
Eight straight. Come on.

251
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:08,606
What if it's still going on
with other players?

252
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:11,528
Man, you know it is.

253
00:13:14,146 --> 00:13:16,020
Then we gotta do something.

254
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:18,916
Like what?

255
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:20,317
You want to go to the police?

256
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:21,860
Go to the school?

257
00:13:22,588 --> 00:13:24,321
Be his victims the rest of our lives?

258
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:25,322
If that ends it.

259
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:28,625
He can't stand against both of us.

260
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:33,564
We did nothing wrong, Kyle.

261
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,005
Would you... would you go in with me?

262
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:44,026
Absolutely.

263
00:13:47,345 --> 00:13:48,878
Come on. Let's see a two.

264
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,346
Atta boy. One, two.

265
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,682
Grant?

266
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,171
Grant!

267
00:13:57,655 --> 00:13:59,122
Grant!

268
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:12,509
Stay calm for us, Kathryn.

269
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:14,202
Everything's going to be fine,
sweetheart.

270
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:16,304
This is exactly where you need to be.

271
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:17,873
Grant, please don't leave.

272
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:19,675
I'll stay right here. I promise.

273
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:22,711
We're going to get her an ultrasound

274
00:14:22,713 --> 00:14:23,946
and assess her from there.

275
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,313
She'll be out shortly.

276
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,637
Good morning, Trevor!

277
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,139
How are your grades?

278
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,407
Have you narrowed down
a list of colleges yet?

279
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:57,210
What can I do to better
help you succeed?

280
00:14:58,246 --> 00:14:59,745
I read my employee manual

281
00:14:59,747 --> 00:15:01,548
and I am ready to guide the shit

282
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,015
outta these pubescent brats.

283
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,485
I need your help with something.

284
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:10,420
Marcy!

285
00:15:13,293 --> 00:15:14,292
Hey!

286
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:17,660
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

287
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:19,699
It's me. Luca.

288
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:23,220
2587.

289
00:15:23,537 --> 00:15:25,871
I was just warned about you
watching members of my team.

290
00:15:27,236 --> 00:15:28,373
I only want to talk.

291
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:30,509
Do you?

292
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:37,718
Hi, Kathryn.

293
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:42,721
I have the results from the ultrasound

294
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:43,755
and the baby is fine.

295
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:45,457
Oh, thank God.

296
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,059
You have formed

297
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,532
a small placental abruption,

298
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:50,729
so we want you to stay in for a bit,

299
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:53,064
just so we can monitor you and the baby,

300
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:54,465
make sure it doesn't get any worse.

301
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:55,657
But what if it does?

302
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,799
It won't.

303
00:15:56,801 --> 00:15:57,902
If the baby forces our hand,

304
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:59,370
we can talk about our options,

305
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:00,438
but for now,

306
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,306
we just need to assess where we're at,
okay?

307
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,376
Buzz the nurses if you need anything.

308
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:06,677
Thanks.

309
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:22,126
You don't remember
anything from that time?

310
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:23,455
Nothing.

311
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:25,162
I was briefed by members of my team

312
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:26,997
about the time I lost, but...

313
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,665
it's not the same as actually living it.

314
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:32,780
Well, at least now I know

315
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,940
why you never came to
visit me in prison.

316
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:36,900
Sorry.

317
00:16:39,344 --> 00:16:41,010
You said you would have died...

318
00:16:41,987 --> 00:16:43,813
Losing my sister before I ever
really got to know her

319
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:44,814
would be worse than...

320
00:16:44,816 --> 00:16:46,140
Luca, Luca...

321
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,020
we were separated so young.

322
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,380
We can't know for sure
that we're really family.

323
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:54,658
Guys, it's Mac.

324
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,692
I'm going to be unavailable for a while.

325
00:16:56,694 --> 00:16:57,559
There's a problem...

326
00:16:58,014 --> 00:16:59,281
What's wrong?

327
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:01,931
Kathryn's in the hospital.

328
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,332
She's had some medical...

329
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,268
complications

330
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,270
and I need to be here with her.

331
00:17:13,311 --> 00:17:14,310
Marcy?

332
00:17:14,312 --> 00:17:15,944
Yeah. I'm on my way.

333
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:18,020
Is everything all right?
Sorry, I have to go.

334
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,580
Holy...

335
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,606
Uh...

336
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:01,978
Hey, this is Marcy.

337
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,879
Leave a message.

338
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,740
Marcy, I won the lottery!

339
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:06,983
6 numbers out of 7!

340
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:10,119
That's 31... $31,000!

341
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:12,388
Isn't that freaking amazing?

342
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,158
It would have been $62,000,

343
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,793
but someone else won the lottery.

344
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,828
Oh, my God.

345
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:22,398
Oh, my God, that's you!

346
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,499
Because I took your numbers!

347
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,780
You won the lottery, too!
Congratulations!

348
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:28,420
Wait...

349
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:32,041
I mean,
that means I took half your money.

350
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:33,342
I mean, that's like...

351
00:18:33,344 --> 00:18:34,877
That's like cheating.

352
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,220
Um...

353
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,981
Yeah, you know what,
I should just give it to you.

354
00:18:38,983 --> 00:18:40,649
So...

355
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,351
That's what I'm gonna do.

356
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:45,253
But, I mean,

357
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:46,288
what are the chances

358
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,222
that your numbers would be picked

359
00:18:47,224 --> 00:18:48,940
any more than my mine, right?

360
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,526
Oh, my God,
did you hear the greed in my voice?

361
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:53,140
Because I sure did.

362
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:55,163
I mean, I may as well

363
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:57,980
have just come out and said
"That money's mine!"

364
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:02,670
This is how money ruins people.

365
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:06,040
I think I'm going to be sick.

366
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,550
Still no answer.

367
00:19:18,554 --> 00:19:20,788
We said we'd meet after second period.

368
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,557
You know, for my first actual case

369
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,859
as a guidance counselor,

370
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:26,560
you could have eased me into it.

371
00:19:26,562 --> 00:19:28,129
Holden!

372
00:19:28,131 --> 00:19:29,931
I have been looking all over for you.

373
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:31,432
Connor needs a QB
that can hit him in the hands

374
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,060
if we want to win state.

375
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:41,442
So...

376
00:19:41,444 --> 00:19:42,980
we'd love to have you out.

377
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:53,220
And Connor, how are things?

378
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:55,660
Could use my old quarterback
back on the team.

379
00:19:56,925 --> 00:19:58,591
Talk some sense into him.

380
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:00,927
Oh, I don't understand sportsball, so...

381
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,780
Can't keep a spot open for you forever,
Trev.

382
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:12,438
Why didn't you just deal with him

383
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,439
right then and there?

384
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:14,940
Not in front of the kid.

385
00:20:14,942 --> 00:20:17,143
It's gonna be hard
enough on him as it is.

386
00:20:41,168 --> 00:20:43,001
78...

387
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:45,770
79...

388
00:20:45,772 --> 00:20:47,506
1,000.

389
00:20:51,878 --> 00:20:53,345
I'm really diggin'
us workin' out together.

390
00:20:53,347 --> 00:20:55,200
Yeah? That's good.

391
00:20:55,648 --> 00:20:56,948
And this playlist...

392
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,380
Damn.

393
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:00,484
You like it?

394
00:21:00,486 --> 00:21:02,220
Oh, yeah.

395
00:21:02,222 --> 00:21:03,321
You gotta...

396
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:05,632
You gotta get that...
that core engaged, right?

397
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:06,664
You know what I mean?

398
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:07,688
Get that heart rate up.

399
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:13,030
You know what I mean?

400
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:15,533
Come on, Carly.

401
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:17,134
You know that body likes to dance.

402
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:20,871
I don't even know what you're doing.

403
00:21:20,873 --> 00:21:22,906
Come on, Carly, it'll come to you.

404
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:24,300
Let it go.

405
00:21:31,316 --> 00:21:33,420
That's right.
Okay.

406
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:37,755
There she is.

407
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:00,310
Hey.

408
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:01,677
What did you find?

409
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,678
I took a look at her file.

410
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,013
There's nothing out of the ordinary.

411
00:22:04,015 --> 00:22:05,281
She's stable.

412
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:06,415
I mean,
her blood pressure's a little high...

413
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,616
Those drugs you gave me...

414
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,786
shouldn't they have
protected her from this?

415
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:12,500
They were designed to help,
not to make her invulnerable.

416
00:22:13,357 --> 00:22:14,723
How do we get you in there?

417
00:22:14,725 --> 00:22:16,358
I don't think you understand...

418
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,427
there's nothing even I could do.

419
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:20,128
She's right where she needs to be,

420
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,729
and if they need
to take the baby out early,

421
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:22,797
a Caesarean section

422
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,065
is a standard procedure
for these doctors.

423
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,540
Medicine isn't magic... in any time.

424
00:22:33,109 --> 00:22:35,700
Would you like me to inform
the team of what's going on?

425
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:38,180
No.

426
00:22:38,781 --> 00:22:40,881
No, I'll do it when the time is right.

427
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:47,487
And, uh, yeah,

428
00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:48,622
it just feels good to know

429
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:51,258
I'm not doing that to my family anymore.

430
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,980
Thank you, Mike.

431
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,443
Philip...

432
00:22:57,265 --> 00:22:58,632
did you want to share?

433
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:02,420
Uh, yeah, I do.

434
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,005
Hi. My name's Philip and I'm an addict.

435
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:07,708
Hi, Philip.

436
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,020
I have a secret.

437
00:23:14,682 --> 00:23:16,540
I know the future.

438
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:20,586
I know what's going to happen.

439
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,323
Global events.

440
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:25,158
Deaths.

441
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,140
Winners of horse races.

442
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:31,764
It was all recently
delivered to me like a movie.

443
00:23:34,802 --> 00:23:38,471
And mostly,
it's the same future that I remember,

444
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:39,972
but there are differences.

445
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,780
You all think I'm crazy right now...

446
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:49,481
but it's true.

447
00:23:53,387 --> 00:23:57,189
For example,
I know that somebody in this room

448
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:59,491
has very recently
been diagnosed with cancer

449
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:01,380
and has decided to ignore it.

450
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,231
As if ignoring the problem
is going to make it go away.

451
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:11,780
Because there is only a 50/50 chance

452
00:24:12,138 --> 00:24:13,371
that the treatment will work.

453
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,209
And they're afraid

454
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:21,020
of going through the pain
of chemotherapy for nothing.

455
00:24:22,515 --> 00:24:23,547
And the truth is,

456
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,620
I don't know...

457
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:27,751
whether this person
is going to live or die

458
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:29,353
if they decide to get treatment.

459
00:24:31,391 --> 00:24:34,825
I only know for certain
that without it...

460
00:24:34,827 --> 00:24:36,527
Philip?

461
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:39,696
Philip?

462
00:24:42,367 --> 00:24:44,401
I'm sorry, what... what was I saying?

463
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,369
Not much.

464
00:24:48,741 --> 00:24:49,872
You stopped talking

465
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:51,874
after you said "I have a secret."

466
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:55,340
Oh.

467
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,780
I'm sorry. Um...

468
00:24:57,782 --> 00:25:00,583
maybe someone else should go.

469
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:03,140
It's all right.

470
00:25:04,222 --> 00:25:05,555
We've all been there.

471
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:01,937
Where have you been?

472
00:26:01,939 --> 00:26:03,371
I'm on my way now.

473
00:26:03,373 --> 00:26:04,339
Don't worry about it, bro.

474
00:26:04,341 --> 00:26:05,340
We're gonna do this.

475
00:26:05,342 --> 00:26:06,775
Have you been drinking?

476
00:26:06,777 --> 00:26:07,776
Pull over.

477
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:09,945
Trevor, I'm fine. Chill.

478
00:26:09,947 --> 00:26:10,946
Where are you?

479
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:12,414
Where are you? Where are you?

480
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:51,697
Oh, hey, nurse. How's she doing?

481
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,595
Excuse me. I asked you a question.

482
00:27:02,564 --> 00:27:03,530
No.

483
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:04,898
It was for your own good.

484
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:06,940
What did you do?

485
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:09,268
Code blue. Code blue.

486
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,838
Go be with her.

487
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:19,445
Dr. Higgins, what's happening?

488
00:27:19,447 --> 00:27:20,913
I can't talk right now, Mr. MacLaren.

489
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:22,348
Please stay out of the way.

490
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:31,824
Philip, I need eyes on Hall right now.

491
00:27:31,826 --> 00:27:33,326
He's leaving the hospital.

492
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:34,420
I'm on it.

493
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,334
Don't lose him.

494
00:28:18,748 --> 00:28:21,014
Kyle! Kyle!

495
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:27,120
Back up!

496
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,589
Kyle, get outta the car.

497
00:28:36,532 --> 00:28:38,131
There's something wrong with this host.

498
00:28:40,102 --> 00:28:41,300
You're just drunk.

499
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:46,339
Traveler 5532,

500
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,700
welcome to the 21st.

501
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,587
This is too much.

502
00:29:01,589 --> 00:29:03,555
Andrew, I have watched you

503
00:29:03,557 --> 00:29:05,691
do everything in your power
to change your circumstances.

504
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,359
I mean, you got clean,

505
00:29:07,361 --> 00:29:09,861
you got that part-time job
at the grocery store.

506
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:11,896
This is just a little financial help

507
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:13,164
to put a roof over your head.

508
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:14,966
But I'll never be able to repay you.
This...

509
00:29:14,968 --> 00:29:16,446
No, I don't want you to.

510
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:17,353
Just, just...

511
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,170
Just keep doing what you're doing

512
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:22,040
and I'll count myself lucky to know you.

513
00:29:22,715 --> 00:29:23,975
I don't know what to say.

514
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:25,443
You don't have to say anything.

515
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,213
Thank you, David.

516
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,416
Okay.

517
00:29:34,026 --> 00:29:34,991
Okay.

518
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,763
Wendy?

519
00:29:55,241 --> 00:29:56,940
I'd like to make your day.

520
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,014
Come on.

521
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,838
You must know something by now.

522
00:30:07,018 --> 00:30:08,184
My latest information

523
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:11,721
is that your wife is still in surgery.

524
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,356
Mr. MacLaren.

525
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,740
Would you come with me, please?

526
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:25,935
Philip!

527
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,770
I need your help.

528
00:30:29,874 --> 00:30:31,941
Look, I know

529
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:34,710
that the historical record
has changed since we got here,

530
00:30:34,712 --> 00:30:35,744
but not everything, right?

531
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:36,745
A lot stays the same.

532
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:37,980
Yeah, why?

533
00:30:37,982 --> 00:30:39,581
Carson Perry.

534
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,082
He's a football coach at my high school.

535
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:42,620
Ring any bells?

536
00:30:45,923 --> 00:30:47,389
Come on, dig deep.

537
00:30:49,427 --> 00:30:50,926
Carson Perry...

538
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,629
gets arrested on 16 counts
of sexual-assault charges

539
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:54,963
as well as possession and distribution

540
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:56,131
of under-age pornography.

541
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:56,998
When?

542
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,399
Not soon.

543
00:30:58,401 --> 00:30:59,864
We can't wait.

544
00:30:59,866 --> 00:31:01,569
Trev, I've been through this,
you assign yourself vigilante...

545
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:03,805
What if it's my protocol 5?

546
00:31:05,075 --> 00:31:06,174
I recently learned

547
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:08,780
that my host was abused
before I got here by him.

548
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:11,779
I had no idea.

549
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:12,980
Neither did I.

550
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:17,518
I promised my friend, Kyle,
that I would help take him down,

551
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,519
and just now...

552
00:31:18,521 --> 00:31:19,854
Kyle was a host candidate.

553
00:31:19,856 --> 00:31:22,056
You knew?
3:09 this afternoon.

554
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:23,090
Driving drunk.

555
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,726
I'm sorry.

556
00:31:24,728 --> 00:31:26,527
I understand why you couldn't tell me,

557
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:29,140
but as far as I'm concerned,
that coach killed him.

558
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,131
I need to fix this...

559
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:37,872
Mr. MacLaren,

560
00:31:37,874 --> 00:31:39,039
in this case,

561
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:43,477
it was Antiphospholipid
Antibody Syndrome, or APS.

562
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:45,278
She developed an arterial thrombus,

563
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,714
which then caused a coronary embolism,

564
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:50,717
which is a clot in the heart.

565
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:52,900
Kathryn went into cardiac arrest.

566
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:58,324
Mr. MacLaren,
in our efforts to save Kathryn's life...

567
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,059
We lost the baby.

568
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:01,220
Yes.

569
00:32:01,475 --> 00:32:03,062
And all I can say is

570
00:32:03,064 --> 00:32:04,364
that it's extremely fortunate

571
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:05,965
that that clot passed on its own,

572
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:06,900
or this would be

573
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:08,034
an even more difficult conversation

574
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:09,380
for both of us to have.

575
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,500
When can I see her?

576
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,910
She's in recovery,

577
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:17,976
she's sedated,

578
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,912
but you can see her in a few hours.

579
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:23,382
Mr. MacLaren,

580
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,484
we have counselors
available if you need them.

581
00:32:25,486 --> 00:32:27,152
Philip, tell me where Hall is.

582
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,421
Boss, he's here.

583
00:32:28,423 --> 00:32:29,688
What?

584
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:34,559
Hey, Boss. Easy.

585
00:32:35,862 --> 00:32:38,330
Get off of me!
We can't do that.

586
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:39,831
You're a dead man!
I know, I know, I know...

587
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,865
You killed my child!

588
00:32:40,867 --> 00:32:42,200
That's not what happened.

589
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:43,601
You'd better hope the Director
overwrites you before I get...

590
00:32:43,603 --> 00:32:45,370
The Director was the one who sent me!

591
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,673
I was on a mission.

592
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:50,860
Let him go.

593
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:52,982
Let him go.

594
00:32:54,448 --> 00:32:55,447
There you go.

595
00:32:57,784 --> 00:32:59,300
What're you talking about?

596
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,286
The child was never going to survive.

597
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:03,455
It was never supposed to.

598
00:33:03,457 --> 00:33:04,388
You don't know that.

599
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,300
My mission was to save your wife.

600
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:09,893
There had to be a way to save them both.

601
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:11,620
I don't think there was.

602
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,465
Listen to your medic, MacLaren.

603
00:33:16,535 --> 00:33:17,734
What did you do?

604
00:33:17,736 --> 00:33:18,970
Kathryn MacLaren

605
00:33:18,972 --> 00:33:19,967
was going to die

606
00:33:19,969 --> 00:33:21,405
of an undiagnosed coronary embolism

607
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:22,539
that stopped her heart

608
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,741
during the delivery
of her stillborn child.

609
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:26,242
The Director ordered me

610
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,945
to give her a traveler-synthesized drug

611
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:28,979
to eliminate the clot

612
00:33:28,981 --> 00:33:30,747
so that she would survive,

613
00:33:30,749 --> 00:33:32,780
because she wasn't supposed to die.

614
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:36,820
Because you broke Protocol 4.

615
00:33:41,093 --> 00:33:43,326
She wanted a child more than anything...

616
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:47,563
You're gonna stand there
and blame her for this?

617
00:33:47,565 --> 00:33:48,860
Is that what you're doing?

618
00:33:52,904 --> 00:33:53,903
No.

619
00:33:56,308 --> 00:33:57,773
Look, I get it.

620
00:33:57,775 --> 00:33:59,008
I get it.

621
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,342
It's tough to stay focused in the 21st.

622
00:34:00,344 --> 00:34:01,577
I mean, that's what I've been
trying to tell you guys

623
00:34:01,579 --> 00:34:02,705
ever since I met you.

624
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:04,346
Trying to teach you guys

625
00:34:04,348 --> 00:34:06,780
to not get caught up
in all the bullshit.

626
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:10,620
But you had to stab me in the back, huh?

627
00:34:13,624 --> 00:34:15,324
The Director obviously agreed with me

628
00:34:15,326 --> 00:34:17,060
or you wouldn't have gone to prison.

629
00:34:21,598 --> 00:34:22,797
Yeah...

630
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,300
I can't argue with that.

631
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,268
I guess we all need a lesson

632
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,820
now and then of what our mission is.

633
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:30,438
And this was yours.

634
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,737
But, hey.

635
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,220
MacLaren, your wife is still alive.

636
00:34:36,585 --> 00:34:38,118
Go be with her.

637
00:35:03,304 --> 00:35:04,870
Welcome home.

638
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,705
Hey. Yeah. Sorry.

639
00:35:06,707 --> 00:35:07,940
Hi.
Hi.

640
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:09,575
I know it's later than I said.

641
00:35:11,879 --> 00:35:13,246
Can I hold him?

642
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:14,980
I was trying to get him to go to sleep.

643
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:16,353
I know. I don't care.

644
00:35:16,355 --> 00:35:17,783
Hey.

645
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:20,060
You wanna cuddle with your mama,
big man?

646
00:35:22,757 --> 00:35:24,140
So...

647
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,291
How was today for Carly Shannon?

648
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:29,828
It's over now, let's leave it at that.

649
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,896
You?

650
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:32,064
I had a pay duty.

651
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,166
I basically just chaperoned
some drunk college kids

652
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:35,780
for time and a half.

653
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:37,769
Sounds awful.

654
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:38,770
Wasn't so bad.

655
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,420
You okay?

656
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:43,460
Tell me about the day he was born.

657
00:35:45,778 --> 00:35:46,977
Ah...

658
00:35:46,979 --> 00:35:48,679
Are you sure you wanna
go there right now?

659
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,500
'Cause that's not your favorite story.

660
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,952
I want to hear it from your perspective.

661
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,008
Grant?

662
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,580
I'm here.

663
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,383
They told me she was a girl.

664
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,218
Holden.

665
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:05,354
Change your mind?

666
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,687
You're going to come clean.

667
00:37:07,182 --> 00:37:08,199
Sorry?

668
00:37:08,201 --> 00:37:10,358
You're going to come forward
to the police

669
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,860
and you're going to detail
all that you've done.

670
00:37:13,496 --> 00:37:15,696
Trevor, what are you talking about?

671
00:37:15,698 --> 00:37:19,033
Do it on your on volition
and face the consequences,

672
00:37:19,035 --> 00:37:20,700
or it'll be done for you.

673
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:23,738
Yeah?

674
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,072
Mm-hmm.

675
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:26,860
I'm not gonna do that.

676
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:29,209
Those are your only two options.

677
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,913
I don't think you realize
what you're doing here.

678
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:35,716
You're really willing
to throw everything away

679
00:37:35,718 --> 00:37:37,451
to destroy both of our lives?

680
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:38,852
There are other lives to consider.

681
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:39,953
Oh, come on.

682
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:41,755
Maybe you don't want
to play football anymore,

683
00:37:41,757 --> 00:37:43,090
but you do not want

684
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:44,291
the shit storm that'll come from this.

685
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:47,020
You prey on young boys
who look up to you.

686
00:37:49,464 --> 00:37:50,397
You make promises

687
00:37:50,399 --> 00:37:52,432
in exchange for access to their bodies.

688
00:37:54,236 --> 00:37:55,802
Come on, Trev.

689
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,771
I will come forward.

690
00:38:01,075 --> 00:38:04,644
I'll talk about
the hotel rooms on the road.

691
00:38:04,646 --> 00:38:06,313
The showers.

692
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:07,314
All of it.

693
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,149
Who's gonna believe you?

694
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:12,118
You're a bad kid and everybody knows it.

695
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,585
People change.

696
00:38:13,587 --> 00:38:15,754
Not the Trevor Holden I know...

697
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:18,457
I don't know where this act came from,

698
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:20,592
but I don't buy it for a second.

699
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:22,761
I know you.

700
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:24,780
Intimately.

701
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,766
You're going to keep your mouth shut.

702
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,668
I'm not threatened by you.

703
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,303
You should be.

704
00:38:34,308 --> 00:38:35,774
Don't push me, kid.

705
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,755
Release the materials.

706
00:38:50,757 --> 00:38:51,622
On it.

707
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:52,623
"Release the materials?"

708
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,260
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

709
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:01,333
Thank you, Philip.

710
00:39:01,335 --> 00:39:04,134
That's what Trevor and Kyle
would've wanted.

711
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:07,204
All we did was accelerate
what was going to happen anyway.

712
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,260
Freak had whole hard drives
of incriminating shit.

713
00:39:11,978 --> 00:39:13,620
He made his choice.

714
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:22,700
No...

715
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:25,356
What?

716
00:39:27,393 --> 00:39:28,859
Oh, no.

717
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:34,831
Oh, no.

718
00:39:34,833 --> 00:39:36,065
Oh, my God.

719
00:39:45,544 --> 00:39:47,143
Oh...

720
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,740
There she is!

721
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:02,725
Did you get your winnings?

722
00:40:02,727 --> 00:40:03,726
I did.

723
00:40:03,728 --> 00:40:04,928
Amazing luck.

724
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,229
Isn't it!

725
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:08,163
You're not upset that I cheated?

726
00:40:08,165 --> 00:40:10,866
No, of course not. I'm happy for you.

727
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:12,211
You must be thrilled.

728
00:40:12,236 --> 00:40:13,857
Yeah! Yeah.

729
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:15,316
It's all gone.

730
00:40:16,574 --> 00:40:17,673
What?

731
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:19,642
Did you ever hear
of the story of St. Francis?

732
00:40:19,644 --> 00:40:20,709
No.

733
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:21,744
Yeah. No, me neither.

734
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:23,278
Somebody called me that today.

735
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:26,348
I don't understand.

736
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,549
I didn't feel right

737
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:28,716
taking what would have been yours

738
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:29,952
if I hadn't peeked at your numbers,

739
00:40:29,954 --> 00:40:31,286
and I know

740
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:32,787
that you wouldn't let me give it back,

741
00:40:32,789 --> 00:40:33,989
so I gave it all away.

742
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:36,624
I helped out a lot of good people.

743
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,360
Honestly, Marcy, it was...

744
00:40:38,362 --> 00:40:39,962
it was the best day of my life.

745
00:40:41,364 --> 00:40:42,497
Remember my...

746
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:43,765
my client, Jason,

747
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,744
with the bad teeth and the hair?

748
00:40:46,746 --> 00:40:47,902
Yeah. I do.

749
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,103
Yeah. Great teeth now.

750
00:40:49,105 --> 00:40:51,205
I mean, they will be.

751
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:53,860
Even getting them cleaned
has made a huge difference.

752
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:55,185
And on Wednesday,

753
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:57,244
he's got some much needed dental work.

754
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,779
Good for Jason.

755
00:40:58,781 --> 00:41:01,140
Yeah! No, he hates dentists.

756
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,451
Who else?

757
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:05,719
I'm not sure if you remember Marjorie.

758
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:07,121
I bought her a new walker.

759
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:08,780
They're pricey for what they are.

760
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:12,426
Steve got one of those scooters
to get to his new job.

761
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,180
He can't walk very far
without breaking into a sweat.

762
00:41:15,464 --> 00:41:18,100
Jordan got my bike
for his pizza delivery job.

763
00:41:18,102 --> 00:41:19,132
Your bike?

764
00:41:19,134 --> 00:41:20,333
Yeah.

765
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:22,540
Yeah,
I thought I'd buy myself a new one.

766
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,484
I should have saved some.

767
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,274
All of it?

768
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,542
I know it sounded like a lot of money,

769
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:32,011
but, I mean,
everything is just so expensive,

770
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:34,947
and I had a whole list of people.

771
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:38,884
David...
It doesn't matter.

772
00:41:38,886 --> 00:41:40,320
I'll get my steps in.

773
00:41:41,196 --> 00:41:42,340
So...

774
00:41:43,425 --> 00:41:44,424
what're you gonna do with yours?

775
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,226
Um...

776
00:41:47,228 --> 00:41:48,828
I have some debts to pay off.

777
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,202
Debts!

778
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:51,684
Wow, that is responsible.

779
00:41:53,307 --> 00:41:54,907
I should have some left over.

780
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,836
Even more responsible!

781
00:41:58,605 --> 00:41:59,638
So what're you gonna do with it?

782
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,641
Well, first...

783
00:42:02,643 --> 00:42:04,275
I'm going to buy you a new bike.

784
00:42:05,646 --> 00:42:07,380
I'm so happy you said that.

785
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:20,914
What's happening right now?

786
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:22,038
Where the hell is this kid?

787
00:42:24,931 --> 00:42:25,930
Give him a minute.

788
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:26,998
He's probably hungover.

789
00:42:28,514 --> 00:42:29,613
I'm sorry, he's what?

790
00:42:34,074 --> 00:42:35,340
Sorry, I'm late.

791
00:42:35,342 --> 00:42:36,373
I was having a hard time

792
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,938
deciding what clothing to bring with me.

793
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,610
Yeah, not a problem, kid.

794
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:40,878
Just don't make it a habit.

795
00:42:42,782 --> 00:42:44,482
So, what's the mission?

796
00:42:46,018 --> 00:42:48,352
The Prime Minister
has called highly threatening.

797
00:42:48,354 --> 00:42:50,888
This will severely impact
foreign relations

798
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,956
if the troops continue
to invade the region

799
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,191
against U.N. sanctions.

800
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:55,959
In local news,

801
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:57,327
a fire ravaged

802
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:59,462
a downtown apartment complex last night,

803
00:42:59,464 --> 00:43:00,697
and authorities are saying

804
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:03,500
that the cause is more than likely...

805
00:43:30,061 --> 00:43:31,493
The yellow pills

806
00:43:31,495 --> 00:43:33,329
will help to focus
your sensory perception

807
00:43:33,331 --> 00:43:35,998
on one timeline at a time.

808
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,533
An unavoidable side-effect

809
00:43:37,535 --> 00:43:40,502
of memory not acquired
by conventional means...
