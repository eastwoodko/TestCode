1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,218
Previously, on Travelers...

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,654
It could correct your condition.

3
00:00:02,656 --> 00:00:04,833
What about all my memories of the 21st?

4
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:06,044
Obviously, none of that.

5
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:07,659
I loved you so much.

6
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:10,029
They're his memories, not yours.

7
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:12,054
If something doesn't work out
the way you want it to,

8
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:13,955
why don't you just go
back and try again?

9
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:15,323
We can only go as far back

10
00:00:15,325 --> 00:00:17,792
as the arrival point
of the most recent Traveler.

11
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:18,793
There's no do-overs.

12
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:19,826
Messengers count.

13
00:00:19,828 --> 00:00:20,733
Messengers cause

14
00:00:20,735 --> 00:00:22,630
the same ripples in space-time
as Travelers.

15
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:24,399
She won't be me.

16
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:26,535
She won't remember...

17
00:00:26,537 --> 00:00:29,403
the most important part of who I am now.

18
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:58,167
I'll meet you outside Ops.

19
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,211
Copy that.

20
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:17,550
Oh! That's the boss!

21
00:01:17,552 --> 00:01:18,918
Road trip.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,420
You're such a kid.

23
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:21,754
Yeah, on the outside.

24
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:23,289
What's that? Boop!

25
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,924
What a freak, man.

26
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,802
What?

27
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:47,613
Oh...

28
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:49,782
Wow. They're beautiful.

29
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:51,783
Thank you.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,295
Mom.

31
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:06,565
Mom remembered.

32
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,940
"Happy...

33
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,441
"anniversary...

34
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:19,410
Grant."

35
00:02:23,984 --> 00:02:25,449
No service?

36
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:27,117
Not one bar.

37
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:29,220
Should've called when
we stopped at that gas station.

38
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:30,588
Told you.

39
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,989
Yeah, then we got lost.

40
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:34,525
How long till impact?

41
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:36,827
23 minutes, 6 seconds.

42
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,196
Ish?

43
00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:40,164
No, pretty much exactly.

44
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,166
I'll have to call her after the mission.

45
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:45,368
I don't understand the big deal
about anniversaries anyway.

46
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,670
My father missed their 25th

47
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:47,671
a few months back.

48
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:48,672
And?

49
00:02:48,674 --> 00:02:51,208
Gary paid a heavy price, boss.

50
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:54,544
Fortunately, Kat's a reasonable person.

51
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:56,180
Ah, reason's got nothin' to do with it.

52
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:57,880
You're already in the doghouse.

53
00:02:57,882 --> 00:02:58,815
Oh, come on.

54
00:02:58,817 --> 00:02:59,816
No, she's right.

55
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:00,950
Your window was early this morning.

56
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:01,884
It's already closed.

57
00:03:01,886 --> 00:03:03,428
How do you know this information?

58
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,821
Covered it in training.

59
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:06,456
"21st-Century Female Behavior."

60
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:09,192
Ah. Well, I'll buy her flowers, then.

61
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:10,227
What anniversary is it?

62
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:11,894
10 years.
Yikes.

63
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:13,062
Whoa.

64
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:15,698
Ah, you're screwing with me now.

65
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,201
No, 10's a big one. Even I know that.

66
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:19,401
Okay, well, help me out.

67
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:21,170
What's an appropriate gift for 10 years?

68
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:22,171
Tin.

69
00:03:22,173 --> 00:03:23,906
Yeah, 10.
No, "tin."

70
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,574
As in the metal.
Tin?

71
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:26,709
That's the traditional gift.

72
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,745
I'm supposed to give her
something made from tin?

73
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:30,746
If you're a traditionalist, yes.

74
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:33,482
There's a more modern
anniversary theme for 10 years,

75
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:34,483
but you're not gonna like it.

76
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,852
Diamonds.

77
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:38,887
Now I know you're making this up.

78
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:40,222
Technically, diamond jewelry.

79
00:03:40,224 --> 00:03:41,189
Yes.

80
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:42,991
Seriously?
You might've gotten away...

81
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:44,260
With flowers, if you'd called.

82
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,895
"Get away with flowers if you called."

83
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:53,300
Where does it come down?

84
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:55,837
600 meters to our south-southwest,

85
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,304
in seven minutes, eight seconds.

86
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,040
There-ish.

87
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:00,608
It's amazing

88
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,878
this becomes a dry lakebed in 50 years.

89
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,445
Do we need to worry about a wave?

90
00:04:04,447 --> 00:04:05,446
Nah.

91
00:04:05,448 --> 00:04:07,348
Probably a splash, but it's not too big.

92
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:09,784
Just extremely rare and important

93
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:10,918
to the future.

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,754
More rare than that other mineral...
what was it?

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,622
Diamond?

96
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:15,923
That's the one.

97
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,057
All right, all right.

98
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,125
Let's get the recovery gear ready

99
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:20,294
and make sure everything's working.

100
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:21,728
The Director gave us
an important mission.

101
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,897
Let's get it right.

102
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:53,885
No!

103
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,522
No!

104
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:03,694
Ah!

105
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,684
You've reached
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

106
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,219
Please leave a message.

107
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,404
Wakefield.

108
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,338
This is an emergency communication,

109
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,606
Protocol Alpha.

110
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:52,007
Protocol Alpha? Who is this?

111
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:54,043
This is Traveler 5001.

112
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,779
We have less than 60 seconds
before signal loss.

113
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:57,914
I'm listening.

114
00:06:57,916 --> 00:06:59,114
I need armed air assets

115
00:06:59,116 --> 00:07:01,884
to the following coordinates A.S.A.P...

116
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:04,454
49.3506 degrees north,

117
00:07:04,456 --> 00:07:07,122
122.8599 degrees west.

118
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:08,828
Can you do this?

119
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,460
Possibly. I have a helicopter

120
00:07:11,462 --> 00:07:13,062
already in the air with agents aboard,

121
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:14,396
but they're not Travelers.

122
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:16,298
I said Protocol Alpha!

123
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,466
Can you get them to these coordinates

124
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:18,567
in 17 minutes?

125
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,471
Negative. Best case is... is 25 to 30.

126
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:23,972
What about assets on the ground?

127
00:07:23,974 --> 00:07:26,608
25 minutes is our closest anything.

128
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,742
You're talking the middle of nowhere.

129
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:30,244
I do have agents on the ground
within roughly...

130
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:33,047
Hello?

131
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:50,631
Give me your keys!

132
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:51,765
Heh. Right.

133
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:52,766
How 'bout we just wait

134
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:54,102
till your little brother touches down?

135
00:07:54,104 --> 00:07:55,936
It's an emergency! Give me the keys.

136
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:58,405
They're in the ignition.

137
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:00,808
Wait. What emergency?

138
00:08:01,944 --> 00:08:03,243
Carrie, what's wrong?

139
00:08:03,245 --> 00:08:04,912
Just tell me what's going on!

140
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:06,346
I'll drive you myself!

141
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:08,115
Carrie!

142
00:08:09,418 --> 00:08:11,284
Carrie!

143
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:17,924
Wayne! Your sister just took my car!

144
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,596
You've reached Special Agent
Grant MacLaren.

145
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:24,597
Please leave a...

146
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:52,358
No service?

147
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,825
Not one bar.

148
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:54,860
Should've called

149
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:56,628
when we stopped at that gas station.

150
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,829
I told you.

151
00:08:57,831 --> 00:08:58,830
Yeah, then we got lost.

152
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:01,066
How long till meteor impact?

153
00:09:01,068 --> 00:09:03,602
22 minutes, 51 seconds.

154
00:09:03,604 --> 00:09:04,736
Ish?

155
00:09:04,738 --> 00:09:06,337
No, pretty much exactly.

156
00:09:06,863 --> 00:09:09,307
I'll call her after the mission.

157
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:10,609
I don't understand the big deal about

158
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:11,977
anniversaries anyway.

159
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:13,779
My father forgot their 25th

160
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:14,780
a few months back.

161
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:15,847
And?

162
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,682
Gary paid a heavy price, boss.

163
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:22,087
Luckily, Kat's a reasonable person.

164
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:23,921
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

165
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:26,524
You're already doomed.

166
00:09:51,683 --> 00:09:54,251
Oh, my gosh. That's a big gun.

167
00:09:54,253 --> 00:09:56,786
Um...
am I on private property right now?

168
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:58,088
I'm so lost.

169
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:02,426
You... You want me to go back?

170
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:04,128
Okay, I can... I can do that.

171
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,463
Um, can you just tell me
where Alouette Lake is?

172
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,733
Are you telling me
the lake's back that way,

173
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:13,903
or are you still telling me
to turn around?

174
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,940
Okay.

175
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,595
Jesus.

176
00:10:41,632 --> 00:10:42,665
Callahan!

177
00:10:47,738 --> 00:10:48,837
What is it?

178
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,572
Where did the Fraser meteor come down?

179
00:10:50,574 --> 00:10:52,440
A dry lakebed just north-east of here.
Why?

180
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,242
It wasn't dry this early in the 21st.

181
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:55,610
What's going on?

182
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:56,911
I just got off the phone with a Traveler

183
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,414
who requested armed assets
to the exact same coordinates

184
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,482
the meteor was historically found

185
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:01,583
50 years from now.

186
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:02,584
We got cut off,

187
00:11:02,586 --> 00:11:04,319
but she said it was Protocol Alpha.

188
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:05,687
How's that possible?

189
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:06,721
What would've happened if Robert Fraser

190
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:08,456
hadn't discovered that element in 2068?

191
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,258
There'd be no
room-temperature superconductor

192
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,359
for quantum processing,

193
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:12,794
no leap in artificial intelligence,

194
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,862
no consciousness-transfer technology...

195
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:16,297
No Director.

196
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,465
Do we know when the meteor came down?

197
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,366
I'm no historian,

198
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,102
but I'm about to bet my job at the FBI

199
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:22,704
that it's sometime
in the next 15 minutes,

200
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:25,239
and that the Faction is trying
to get to it before we do.

201
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:27,508
The Director overwrote
all the Faction members.

202
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,510
Only the Faction members
it could get eyes on.

203
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:30,644
There could be hundreds still out there,

204
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,446
or worse, it's somebody else.

205
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:55,869
Hey! What the hell?

206
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,537
You all right?

207
00:12:40,213 --> 00:12:41,880
Amazing to me

208
00:12:41,882 --> 00:12:44,383
this becomes a dry lakebed in 50 years.

209
00:12:44,385 --> 00:12:46,084
Do we need to worry about a wave?

210
00:12:46,086 --> 00:12:47,952
Nah. Probably a splash.

211
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:49,888
Nothing too big.

212
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,056
Just extremely rare
and important to the future.

213
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:53,524
Even more rare than
that other mineral...

214
00:12:53,526 --> 00:12:54,525
what is it again?

215
00:12:54,527 --> 00:12:56,394
You mean diamond?

216
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:57,461
That's it.

217
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:58,897
All right,
let's get the recovery gear ready

218
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,464
and make sure everything's working.

219
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:02,100
The Director gave us
an important mission.

220
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,766
Let's not mess it up.

221
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:11,691
Get back from the water!

222
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,900
Carrie!

223
00:13:59,902 --> 00:14:01,835
Carrie, what's wrong?

224
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,782
Buddy, open your chute...

225
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:51,049
Wayne! Open your chute!

226
00:15:04,364 --> 00:15:05,663
God.

227
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:08,799
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no! No, no!

228
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:11,594
Wayne? Wayne!

229
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,610
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh...

230
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:25,286
Carrie!

231
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:34,260
What're you doing?

232
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:37,664
Carrie!

233
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,833
Carrie, what's wrong?

234
00:16:49,736 --> 00:16:51,202
Well, then, help me out.

235
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:53,096
What's an appropriate gift for 10 years?

236
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:54,973
Tin.
Yeah, 10.

237
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:56,340
No, tin.

238
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:57,575
Like soup tin?

239
00:16:57,577 --> 00:16:59,210
As in the metallic element.

240
00:16:59,945 --> 00:17:01,480
That's the traditional gift.

241
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:04,048
I'm supposed to give her
something made from tin?

242
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,622
You cut that deployment close.
What happened?

243
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,391
We collided. He's unconscious,

244
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:15,859
but I managed to get his parachute open

245
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:17,795
before we separated.

246
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:19,262
If he lands like that,
he'll break his neck.

247
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:21,364
Do you have any weapons in the car?

248
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,532
What?
Weapons.

249
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:24,601
No.

250
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,442
What are you doing?

251
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:29,239
The camera saw a knife in the pickup.

252
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,240
What?

253
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:31,241
Carrie!

254
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:34,411
Carrie!

255
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,147
Hey. This place is where?

256
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:48,444
I'm lost. Can you help me?

257
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:55,656
O-Okay.
Fine, but... this place is where?

258
00:18:55,658 --> 00:18:57,424
I need to know.

259
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:17,811
Might've gotten away
with flowers if you'd called.

260
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:20,246
Yeah, we established I made a mistake.

261
00:19:20,248 --> 00:19:22,145
Now you got to get her
a diamond-something.

262
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:23,240
Really?

263
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:25,723
Explain how buying
something hard and shiny,

264
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:27,090
and artificially expensive,

265
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:28,358
because it's controlled by a cartel,

266
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,726
gets me out of the dog pound.

267
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:30,727
"Doghouse."

268
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:31,595
Were you trained at all

269
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:32,996
in 21st-century male behavior?

270
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:35,098
I think he's nailing it.

271
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,432
Historically, diamonds have always been

272
00:19:36,434 --> 00:19:37,433
a rare and precious gift.

273
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:38,434
Oh, shut up.

274
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:40,370
Solve your own problems then.

275
00:19:40,372 --> 00:19:42,105
Yeah,
but if it's rare and precious she wants,

276
00:19:42,107 --> 00:19:43,373
I'll chip a fragment off the meteor

277
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,874
after we recover it.

278
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:45,841
It could come in handy

279
00:19:45,843 --> 00:19:46,842
if Kathryn ever needs

280
00:19:46,844 --> 00:19:47,977
a high-temperature superconductor

281
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,512
for quantum processing.

282
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:50,546
You shut up, too.

283
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,064
Hey! What the hell?

284
00:20:15,805 --> 00:20:18,240
Asshole.

285
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:56,577
You've reached
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

286
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:58,946
Please leave a message.

287
00:20:58,948 --> 00:21:01,315
Hey, it's me.

288
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:04,384
Just giving you
the benefit of the doubt here.

289
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:06,252
I know you're probably busy on a case

290
00:21:06,254 --> 00:21:07,955
and I married an FBI agent,

291
00:21:08,459 --> 00:21:09,856
but I'm assuming,

292
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:12,993
when you write "won't be by tonight,
work"

293
00:21:12,995 --> 00:21:13,994
in a text,

294
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:15,528
it just means that you're gonna be late,

295
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,497
because tonight, of all nights,

296
00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:19,365
we should spend some time together

297
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:20,833
no matter what time it is.

298
00:21:20,835 --> 00:21:21,834
Hint, hint.

299
00:21:23,371 --> 00:21:25,205
Okay, so...

300
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:27,873
I'm gonna plan something for later,
nothing fancy.

301
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:31,482
You just need to let me know
roughly when that will be.

302
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:34,068
You can even text me.

303
00:21:34,849 --> 00:21:36,362
I'll be here.

304
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:38,784
Bye.

305
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
MacLaren!

306
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:52,797
You're in danger!

307
00:21:55,503 --> 00:21:57,424
MacLaren!

308
00:21:58,054 --> 00:21:59,037
All right, well,

309
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,239
let's get the recovery gear ready,

310
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:01,306
make sure everything's working.

311
00:22:01,308 --> 00:22:02,674
The Director
gave us an important mission.

312
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:03,975
Let's not screw it up.

313
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:08,647
MacLaren!

314
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:09,848
Did you hear that?

315
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:10,815
What?

316
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:12,606
Your team is in danger!

317
00:22:13,153 --> 00:22:14,318
MacLaren!

318
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:16,187
Run!

319
00:22:16,189 --> 00:22:17,255
Carrie?

320
00:22:17,257 --> 00:22:18,256
Get off the beach!

321
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:19,323
What're you doing here?

322
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:20,759
Traveler 500...

323
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:48,252
Oh, God!

324
00:23:07,523 --> 00:23:09,455
Carrie, pull your chute.

325
00:23:11,142 --> 00:23:12,776
Carrie!

326
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:57,823
What happened up there?

327
00:23:57,825 --> 00:23:59,691
We collided.

328
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:01,560
Then Wayne must be unconscious.

329
00:24:01,562 --> 00:24:02,728
Give me your keys.

330
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,429
Wait, what?
Your keys.

331
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:05,497
No. You're hurt!

332
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:06,564
I need to go.

333
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:08,266
No, no, no. You're not going anywhere.

334
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:09,501
You're staying right here.

335
00:24:09,503 --> 00:24:10,835
The future is at stake.

336
00:24:10,837 --> 00:24:12,570
No, you got a concussion.

337
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:15,573
But the faction is gonna win
if we do not act.

338
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:16,836
Okay, whatever.

339
00:24:16,838 --> 00:24:18,836
Just... Just don't move, okay?

340
00:24:18,838 --> 00:24:20,354
Your brother's in trouble.

341
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:24,448
He's gonna break his neck.

342
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,678
What happened?

343
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,212
Did you crash into each other?

344
00:26:09,052 --> 00:26:11,185
Too much strain on the host.

345
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:13,087
What? What?

346
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,992
There are five people on a remote beach.

347
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:19,393
It's not far...

348
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:20,594
Who?

349
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:21,728
Doesn't matter.

350
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,297
Listen.

351
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:26,333
You need to help them. I can't make it.

352
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,535
You're not making any sense.

353
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:32,339
Everything is at stake.

354
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,575
You need to do this.

355
00:26:34,577 --> 00:26:35,642
Do what? Do what?

356
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:37,878
I-I don't understand!

357
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,312
The coordinates.

358
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:40,881
Y-You need...

359
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:43,383
You... You need to...

360
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:52,392
Carrie?

361
00:26:54,663 --> 00:26:56,696
Carrie.

362
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,299
Oh, God...

363
00:26:59,855 --> 00:27:01,320
Oh, God.

364
00:27:02,797 --> 00:27:05,098
Oh, God!

365
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:09,308
Well,
if it's rare and precious she wants,

366
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,609
I'll chip a fragment off the meteor

367
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:11,777
after we recover it.

368
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:12,912
It could come in handy

369
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:14,080
if Kathryn ever needs

370
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:15,280
a high-temperature superconductor

371
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:16,782
for a quantum frame.

372
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:17,883
You shut up too.

373
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:26,891
Are you sure this is it?

374
00:27:26,893 --> 00:27:28,360
This is the place.

375
00:27:28,362 --> 00:27:29,595
It sure doesn't look
anything like the pictures

376
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:30,596
when it was found.

377
00:27:30,598 --> 00:27:32,264
This is beautiful.

378
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:33,565
Yeah, it's nice.

379
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:36,602
Nice? This is like seeing Niagara Falls

380
00:27:36,604 --> 00:27:37,869
before it went dry,

381
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:38,903
or the Great Valley

382
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,539
before the domes were built.

383
00:27:40,541 --> 00:27:42,807
Yeah. I said it was nice.

384
00:27:46,813 --> 00:27:48,880
She's not wrong.

385
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:51,689
Car keys! Give me the keys!

386
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:54,792
Oh, my God. Wayne, she's dead.

387
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:56,926
Give me the keys!

388
00:31:37,693 --> 00:31:39,872
You've reached
Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

389
00:31:39,874 --> 00:31:41,061
Please leave a message.

390
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:45,865
Hello, Special Agent Grant MacLaren.

391
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:48,268
This is your apparently-not-so-special

392
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,669
wife of 10 years,

393
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:51,204
as of today.

394
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:53,707
10 years, Grant.

395
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:55,909
I left you a phone message

396
00:31:55,911 --> 00:31:58,277
and I sent you a "Happy
Anniversary" text

397
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,278
before that,

398
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,314
but neither really cover
the range of emotion

399
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:03,382
that I'm feeling at the moment.

400
00:32:03,384 --> 00:32:05,018
All I can say is,

401
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,385
you bloody well better be

402
00:32:06,387 --> 00:32:08,254
shopping in a jewelry store right now

403
00:32:08,256 --> 00:32:11,157
that happens to have
shitty cell phone reception.

404
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,392
Call me back when you get this.

405
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,174
Yeah, I said it was nice.

406
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:34,446
She's not wrong.

407
00:32:41,054 --> 00:32:43,788
This is 026. Inbound with a full load.

408
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,789
About an hour out.

409
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:47,292
026, copy. See you then.

410
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:52,197
Piece of shit.

411
00:33:18,811 --> 00:33:19,723
Got a sec?

412
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,692
Yeah.

413
00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:23,327
Is everything all right?

414
00:33:23,329 --> 00:33:25,196
If you mean with Kat
and the pregnancy...

415
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:26,330
The pills you gave me...
This isn't the time...

416
00:33:26,332 --> 00:33:27,698
Or the place.
No, I know.

417
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,366
I was going to ask about you.

418
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:32,803
I'm fine.

419
00:33:32,805 --> 00:33:34,671
I don't think you are.

420
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,841
Part of the team leader's job
is to have some inkling

421
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:38,842
about the general welfare...

422
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:40,677
I said that I was fine.
You're not fine.

423
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:42,245
You're unhappy.

424
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:44,414
Look, Marcy,

425
00:33:44,416 --> 00:33:46,282
you can't possibly remember this, but...

426
00:33:46,284 --> 00:33:48,084
I didn't want to be reset?

427
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:50,019
Someone told you?

428
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,987
We should just get back to the mission.

429
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:55,024
No. There's plenty of time.
Let them take care of it.

430
00:33:55,026 --> 00:33:58,194
Look, I didn't see the good
in telling you that information,

431
00:33:58,196 --> 00:34:00,263
and maybe I was wrong,

432
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:02,532
but it's pretty obvious to me,

433
00:34:02,534 --> 00:34:03,699
and probably everyone else,

434
00:34:03,701 --> 00:34:06,568
that the new Marcy is different
from the old one

435
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:09,864
in ways she wouldn't approve.

436
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:11,774
She?

437
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,776
That's your word.

438
00:34:13,778 --> 00:34:15,778
Well, hers.

439
00:34:37,134 --> 00:34:38,733
I just...

440
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:44,773
I just can't help but feel
that I'm not really...

441
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:46,234
What?

442
00:34:47,477 --> 00:34:48,736
Whole.

443
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:50,745
That, when Grace

444
00:34:50,747 --> 00:34:52,980
sent my consciousness to the future,

445
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:54,148
repackaged it,

446
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,716
and then sent it back again,

447
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:58,619
that she left out what...

448
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:00,421
made me "me".

449
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:07,662
That very day,

450
00:35:07,664 --> 00:35:09,930
you told me you were afraid of losing

451
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:12,266
the most important part
of who you had become

452
00:35:12,268 --> 00:35:13,767
in your short time in the 21st.

453
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:15,302
How do I even know what that is?

454
00:35:15,304 --> 00:35:17,504
I don't think it's my place to say,
but...

455
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:19,239
I can give you a hint.

456
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,289
After that plane crash
that should've killed me,

457
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,691
when you and a million nanites

458
00:35:37,693 --> 00:35:39,158
were trying to put me back together...

459
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:41,328
my own consciousness

460
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,297
took refuge in the memories
of Grant MacLaren.

461
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,666
Well, that's not possible.
There are none.

462
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:48,667
Only a few.

463
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:50,402
Disconnected fragments.

464
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:57,176
Of what?

465
00:35:57,178 --> 00:36:00,212
Of how much Grant MacLaren
loved his wife.

466
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:03,949
Memories even his death couldn't erase.

467
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:11,857
How do I possibly access that?

468
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:13,826
You're the doctor.

469
00:36:22,669 --> 00:36:25,036
Where does it come down?

470
00:36:25,038 --> 00:36:28,373
600 meters to our south-southwest.

471
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:53,649
Killer day, huh?

472
00:36:54,652 --> 00:36:57,520
Yeah. Yeah. It's... killer.

473
00:36:58,691 --> 00:37:00,390
What's are you guys up to?

474
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:05,461
Uh, heading up to a lake,
do a little camping.

475
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:06,629
Fishing!
Fishing.

476
00:37:08,132 --> 00:37:10,599
What about you? What are you up to?

477
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:13,101
About 15,000 feet.

478
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:15,571
We're going skydiving.

479
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:18,307
Oh! That sounds... terrifying.

480
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:19,742
You know, it's...

481
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,277
Oh, yeah. No. It'll clear up.

482
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:23,645
You know, statistically,

483
00:37:23,647 --> 00:37:25,302
it's actually safer than driving.

484
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:26,781
So people tell me.

485
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:28,183
You should try it sometime.

486
00:37:28,185 --> 00:37:31,119
No. I'm not...
I'm not so good with things in the sky.

487
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:32,887
Okay.

488
00:37:32,889 --> 00:37:34,789
Gotta fly, Carrie.

489
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:36,825
See you later.

490
00:37:36,827 --> 00:37:39,282
Yeah, have fun... Carrie.

491
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:41,195
Isn't she a little young for you?

492
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:44,131
And I'm married. I know.

493
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:46,023
Uh, speaking of which...

494
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:49,571
your wife just texted you,
saying "Happy Anniversary".

495
00:37:49,573 --> 00:37:51,606
What? Shit!

496
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:52,874
You might wanna give her a call.

497
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:58,045
Didn't have any fresh fruit like
you asked,

498
00:37:58,047 --> 00:38:01,515
so I got you something
called a "fruit pie" instead.

499
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:04,051
Has the word "fruit" in it.

500
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:06,653
Sure does.

501
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:08,689
Thanks, Trev. That's great.

502
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,769
Whoa! Turn it up!
This is my favorite part!

503
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:24,744
No, you'll just sing louder.

504
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:34,714
Don't roll your eyes at me!

505
00:38:36,751 --> 00:38:40,686
<i>Back to where I was before</i>

506
00:38:40,688 --> 00:38:42,688
<i>Bye-bye, baby</i>

507
00:38:50,431 --> 00:38:51,463
Well, the problem is, when I said turn,

508
00:38:51,465 --> 00:38:52,598
you didn't turn.

509
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,766
The GPS said there's no road.

510
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:54,867
Well, there's one on the map.

511
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:56,135
So we'll turn around.

512
00:38:56,658 --> 00:38:58,070
Okay.
There's lots of time.

513
00:38:58,072 --> 00:38:59,104
Thank you.

514
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,539
Are you sure this is it?

515
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,184
This is the place.

516
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:14,511
Sure doesn't look anything like
the pictures when it was found.

517
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:15,845
This is beautiful.

518
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:50,513
Marcy, you can't possibly remember this,
but...

519
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:52,648
I didn't want to be reset?

520
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,416
Someone told you?

521
00:40:54,418 --> 00:40:56,084
We should just get back to the mission.

522
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:57,853
No. There's plenty of time.

523
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,055
Let them take care of it.

524
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,691
Look. I didn't see the good
in telling you that information,

525
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,526
and maybe I was wrong,

526
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,594
but it's pretty obvious to me,

527
00:41:06,596 --> 00:41:08,596
and probably everyone else,

528
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:11,432
that the new Marcy
is different from the old one

529
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,734
in ways she wouldn't approve.

530
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:18,506
That very day,

531
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:20,675
you told me you were afraid of losing

532
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:22,943
the most important part
of who you had become

533
00:41:22,945 --> 00:41:24,546
in your short time in the 21st.

534
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,314
How do I even know what that is?

535
00:41:26,316 --> 00:41:28,583
I don't think it's my place to say,
but...

536
00:41:28,585 --> 00:41:30,217
I can give you a hint.

537
00:41:40,863 --> 00:41:42,924
After the plane crash
that should've killed me,

538
00:41:42,926 --> 00:41:44,431
when you and a million nanites

539
00:41:44,433 --> 00:41:46,100
were trying to put me back together...

540
00:41:46,102 --> 00:41:47,867
my own consciousness

541
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:50,637
took refuge in the memories
of Grant MacLaren.

542
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:55,121
But how do I possibly access that?

543
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:57,311
You're the doctor.

544
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:01,348
MacLaren!

545
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,549
Did you hear that?

546
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:17,563
Ohh!

547
00:42:26,274 --> 00:42:27,607
MacLaren!

548
00:42:51,465 --> 00:42:52,731
Identify yourself.

549
00:42:52,733 --> 00:42:54,366
Traveler 5008.

550
00:42:54,368 --> 00:42:56,033
I'm on a Protocol Alpha mission...

551
00:42:56,035 --> 00:42:57,136
We know, it's all over.

552
00:42:57,138 --> 00:42:58,536
Marcy, all clear!

553
00:42:58,538 --> 00:42:59,537
No, one more down the road.

554
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:00,739
I had to go around him.

555
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:02,307
I took care of him first.

556
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:03,642
We did it.

557
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:06,584
Thank you both.

558
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:07,641
That was close.

559
00:43:07,847 --> 00:43:09,647
You don't know how close.

560
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:13,050
We weren't the first.

561
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:14,385
We had to keep trying.

562
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:16,187
How many times?

563
00:43:16,189 --> 00:43:18,222
I was the ninth volunteer.

564
00:43:18,224 --> 00:43:19,957
Jesus.

565
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:22,726
If the element ended up
in the hands of the Faction,

566
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:24,295
the whole Traveler
program might never...

567
00:43:36,175 --> 00:43:37,541
See? Just a splash.

568
00:43:37,543 --> 00:43:39,843
Our mission is to recover
and secure the meteorite

569
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:41,178
upon impact, so...

570
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,979
We'll stay here and watch
your back till you're done.

571
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:44,815
I'll have him patched up by then.

572
00:43:46,985 --> 00:43:48,518
There's one other thing.

573
00:43:49,955 --> 00:43:52,088
We have your next mission.
