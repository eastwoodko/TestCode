1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,201
Previously on Travelers...

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,703
We're travelers from the future.

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:05,938
In our time, many years from now,

4
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,139
humanity has been all but wiped out.

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,641
We've come back to change that.

6
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:10,842
There are thousands of travelers

7
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,377
already here taking part.

8
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,745
Let's save the world.

9
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,380
Thanks.

10
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:16,782
No pressure.

11
00:00:17,884 --> 00:00:19,151
I reset the Director.

12
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,218
What?

13
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:22,554
Rebooted its OS through a virus

14
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:23,688
to protect it from corruption

15
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:24,857
by the Faction.

16
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,558
What's happening in the future
while it's offline?

17
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,393
Chaos, probably.

18
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,862
A temporary power struggle.

19
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:32,331
Your team knows first-hand

20
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,366
the brutality they're capable of.

21
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,500
You mean they're the ones

22
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,535
who put us in those cages?

23
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,969
Duck.

24
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:40,872
What are you doing?

25
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,040
"Kill 3468..."

26
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:44,709
that is the mission
I was given by the Director.

27
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:46,678
We have to destroy the Quantum Frame...

28
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,246
before they get here.
Don't do it, son.

29
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,948
We don't have a choice,
they're going to be here soon!

30
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:50,949
Don't.

31
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:51,950
Ellis, there's another way...

32
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,219
They're coming in!

33
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:56,688
F.B.I., drop your weapons!

34
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,496
The dream begins the same every time...

35
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,448
Where's Greg?

36
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,582
Oh, he called in sick.

37
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:24,717
I'm covering for him.

38
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:25,717
Just fix it, please.

39
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,119
Mr. Corrigan has
a conference call at 8:45.

40
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:28,154
Not a problem.

41
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,755
Greg, hey, thanks for coming.

42
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,756
I'm Vincent.

43
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:32,858
Screen's locked up again.

44
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,393
I'm gonna need it
for a call in five minutes.

45
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,394
Can you get me back up?

46
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,728
Oh, yeah, for sure.

47
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,497
I just need to get back there.

48
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,466
Hal? Listen, I gotta let the I.T. guy

49
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,867
work on the computer for a bit here.

50
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,468
Let me just duck into another office.

51
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:44,803
Yeah, let me put you on hold, hang on.

52
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,505
Just take two minutes, two minutes...

53
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,708
Sorry.

54
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,643
Just turn it off and on again,
I guess, huh?

55
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,279
No, no, no, sir.

56
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,331
From the moment
I arrive in the 21st Century,

57
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:48,167
something's wrong.

58
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:50,969
According to the historical record,

59
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,973
Anthony Corrigan, stockbroker,

60
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:57,509
was at his desk on a conference call,

61
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:01,313
but instead, it's someone else.

62
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:08,254
We were wrong.

63
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:13,092
I try to send the message,

64
00:03:13,127 --> 00:03:16,762
but the computer freezes.

65
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:20,232
I practiced a hundred times,
but everything's wrong.

66
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,103
I try to reboot the system,
but there's no time now.

67
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,422
The mission's a failure.

68
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:51,130
So why should I sacrifice myself?

69
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:17,389
I decide I should at least
try to warn them.

70
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:19,891
Everyone listen!

71
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:22,227
I can't explain why,

72
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,662
but if you don't all
follow me right now,

73
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,531
you're going to die.

74
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,504
You have to leave now.

75
00:04:32,539 --> 00:04:33,972
Greg...

76
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,976
what the hell are you doing?

77
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,579
I run.

78
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,748
I don't even know what floor I'm on,

79
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,751
only that I have to hurry.

80
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,035
At first, I hear the plane...

81
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,671
and then the explosion.

82
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,011
And I don't remember anything else

83
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,614
until I'm outside, looking up.

84
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,017
All right, everybody, clear out.
Let's go.

85
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,664
We're going to need
that building evacuated.

86
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:52,651
Everyone around me is looking
at the destruction above,

87
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,319
while I discard the last vestiges

88
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:57,890
of the man who was
supposed to die that day.

89
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:05,063
And then I hear the second plane.

90
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,640
And then I wake up.

91
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,746
Dreams of 9/11 aren't uncommon, Vincent,

92
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:24,016
even for those who were
nowhere near ground zero.

93
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,886
I have the dream because it happened.

94
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:31,357
My mission was a proof of concept,

95
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,758
to send a confirmation

96
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:35,994
that I arrived safely
in the 21st Century,

97
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,230
then die, so no one could trace me.

98
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,231
But...

99
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,699
I survived.

100
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,603
They won't forgive that.

101
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,604
So you're afraid

102
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,172
whomever you were
to send this message to

103
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,908
intends to punish you?

104
00:06:50,144 --> 00:06:51,877
They're already here.

105
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,978
I've seen the changes in history.

106
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:57,916
At least, the histories that I remember.

107
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,452
And they'll be coming for me.

108
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:33,752
Walt!

109
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,954
Jesus, what took you so long?

110
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,089
You're lucky they gave me permission

111
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,490
to talk to you at all...
I'm gonna say one thing,

112
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:39,958
and I need you to listen,

113
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:41,493
destroy that device

114
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,728
by whatever means possible.

115
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,964
I've never asked you to do
anything more important.

116
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,098
What, that thing in the barn?

117
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,133
You need to do it now...

118
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,301
What is it?

119
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,170
What is your association
with those people in the barn?

120
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:54,573
They all raised a red flag
a few months back.

121
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,175
You said that they were
just a bunch of kids.

122
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,843
I ask because

123
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,111
two of those people are in the hospital,

124
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,047
and a farmer is dead.

125
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:10,155
All right, I'll talk.

126
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,456
A few weeks ago...

127
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,693
I received a top-secret
inter-departmental communication

128
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,895
asking if I'd noticed
any changes in you.

129
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,162
I told a pair of special agents

130
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,798
with very expensive sunglasses

131
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,000
that, yeah...

132
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:23,301
You know your friends are
giving you up as we speak.

133
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,970
Sir,
can you please be quiet so I can think?

134
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,138
and your wife noticed, too.

135
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,807
Nothing that either one of us
could point to,

136
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:29,908
but enough to say

137
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:30,943
that something is up.

138
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,178
These people, whoever they are,

139
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:35,113
if they have something on you,
if they're using you,

140
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:36,381
if they're making you do things,

141
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,782
we can protect you!

142
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:41,220
Destroy the device.

143
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,121
That's all I got.

144
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,856
They're never gonna do that, boss.

145
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,424
Philip, stay off the coms.

146
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,561
I'm not talking to you anymore.

147
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:06,978
Before I go...

148
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:10,182
they wanted me to ask you about this.

149
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,254
Well, Walt,

150
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,389
that's a handkerchief.

151
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,158
They tell me
it's a communication device.

152
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,493
Really?

153
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,561
It's made from something
called graphine.

154
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,331
A technology we're working on
but we're not quite there yet.

155
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,598
They suspect that it's powered

156
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,868
by the natural electricity
of the human body,

157
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:34,239
capable of broadcasting
an encrypted signal for miles.

158
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,108
This one came from
the high-school senior

159
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:37,776
that's in surgery right now.

160
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,947
How is she doing?

161
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,248
Rifle was shot from point-blank range.

162
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,250
There's severe damage
to the spleen and...

163
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,251
Who are you?

164
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,252
Seriously, no one told you?

165
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,553
I'm a specialist,

166
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,289
here to assist from Grace hospital.

167
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,158
Call me Derek.

168
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,630
And suction?

169
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,799
Take care of that blood.

170
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,935
The bullet's causing
a lot of inflammation

171
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,103
between the T-12 and L-1.

172
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,505
I'm worried about the lumbar nerves.

173
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,505
We can't get ahead

174
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,907
of this blood loss anyway, so...

175
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:09,908
Okay.

176
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,743
Let's get it outta there.

177
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,051
I need to state for the record

178
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,185
that you gave me permission

179
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,319
to look at your phone
and listen to your messages

180
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,854
without a lawyer present.

181
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:25,390
Well, I have nothing to hide, so...

182
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,125
Wait, what are you doing?

183
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:29,327
I'm playing back a saved message.

184
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,328
Yeah, that one,

185
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,798
that has nothing to do with...
with anything.

186
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,568
Sir, the message came
from a phone registered to you

187
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,635
that called this number

188
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,305
two seconds before a man
with no identification...

189
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,508
who was allegedly holding
a gun to your head...

190
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,178
was fatally shot from
the apartment next door.

191
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:49,581
And you saved this message because...

192
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:51,984
It's kind of a keeper.

193
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,821
Hey, David, it's me.

194
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:59,824
I guess it's my turn
to leave you a goofy message.

195
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,992
I just know how stressed out you get

196
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,327
when you don't hear from me,

197
00:11:02,363 --> 00:11:06,064
so I wanted you to know that
I might be away for a while,

198
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,199
maybe even relocated.

199
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,968
I just don't want you
wondering or worrying

200
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,336
if you don't hear from me.

201
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,370
You know, if it happens.

202
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,571
I don't even know for sure if it will,

203
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:15,674
but if it does,..

204
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,975
thank you for being there for me

205
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,545
when I really needed someone.

206
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,181
In another time or another life, right?

207
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,850
Goodbye, David.

208
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,821
See?

209
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,323
This is bullshit!

210
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,160
Jesus, he's having a bad day.

211
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,360
Are you kidding me?

212
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,529
Hey, Jeff, keep your voice down.

213
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,530
I told you what happened.

214
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,199
The optics suck, and you know it.

215
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,268
It's on the news,
you shot a 13-year-old kid.

216
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,203
That was about to shoot Carly.

217
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,406
Who also murdered her mother
and brother last night.

218
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:49,775
That kid?

219
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,042
Number 2 pencil to the head,

220
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,110
both of them.

221
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,879
Girl was certifiable.

222
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:56,715
Now, get Carly's ass down here
to make a statement,

223
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,716
and you're just

224
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,883
the poor bastard who had to stop her.

225
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,653
Okay, Carly's not answering her cell.

226
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,889
We've been having trouble at home.

227
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:05,023
In the meantime, buddy, I'm sorry,

228
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,390
but I gotta take your badge.

229
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,692
Forensic's already got your gun.

230
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,227
Oh, come on,

231
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,462
this is bullshit, man.

232
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,930
Let me just go down the hall
and talk to him.

233
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:12,964
Hey, no.

234
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,799
Not with booze on your breath, okay?

235
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,534
Hey, if I was forced to shoot a kid,

236
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,203
I might have a few drinks, too.

237
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:21,406
This is gonna work itself out.

238
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,643
Just go home.

239
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,785
I can see

240
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,121
there's a fight goin' on inside of you.

241
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,526
If you're worried about Kat...

242
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:44,162
She is completely in the dark
about this.

243
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,764
She called me earlier

244
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:48,299
to tell me that you sent her away.

245
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,735
That your life was in danger
and so was hers.

246
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,304
Is that true?

247
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,573
It's what made me put a team together

248
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,308
to come after you.

249
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,577
We were tracking your car,

250
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,212
and then it disappeared
like it went into a dead zone...

251
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,579
Yes, but...

252
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,482
she's all right?

253
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,586
If you don't talk, you won't walk,

254
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,087
which means Kat may never, ever find out

255
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,890
whether you are dead or alive...

256
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,125
Destroy the device, Walt.

257
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,794
Please.

258
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,331
I'm begging you.

259
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,668
Look,
I probably shouldn't tell you this,

260
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,669
but I have also been told

261
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:25,871
that that device is far beyond...

262
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:30,242
Thank you, Agent Forbes.

263
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,443
I'll take it from here.

264
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,678
Look, I need more time.

265
00:13:33,714 --> 00:13:35,647
Seriously?

266
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:38,783
You're telling him
more than he's telling you.

267
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,886
But, hey, thanks for trying.

268
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,755
Walt...

269
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,424
remember what I said.

270
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:46,424
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

271
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,093
"Destroy the device."

272
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,994
He heard you the first time.

273
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,197
We all did.

274
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,668
Yeah, it's not gonna happen.

275
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Are you feeling threatened, Vincent?

276
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:07,013
No, I have defenses in place.

277
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:09,715
Deuterium oxide
in the radiant heating system

278
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,384
acts as a fair space/time attenuator.

279
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,486
It slows neutrons.

280
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:17,923
Don't worry, it's not radioactive.

281
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:19,225
Uh...

282
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,560
Why wouldn't they just assume
that you died on 9/11?

283
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:24,764
Why do you think that
they're still after you?

284
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,301
Because they've already found me twice.

285
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,570
I found my way out of New York,

286
00:14:31,606 --> 00:14:34,240
and took a train
to the Pacific Northwest.

287
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,876
I had the money
and the stock certificates

288
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,377
I'd taken from the safe,

289
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:39,512
but if I was going to stay hidden,

290
00:14:39,547 --> 00:14:41,581
I needed more.

291
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:42,981
Historically,

292
00:14:43,017 --> 00:14:45,017
a man named Oliver Norton
became a tech millionaire

293
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,118
on his own,

294
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,287
and all I did was insert myself
into the process

295
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,922
as invisibly as possible,

296
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:53,392
and take my fair share.

297
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:57,296
I had convinced Oliver that
I had debilitating phobias,

298
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,565
difficulties dealing with people,

299
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,866
privacy...

300
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:02,567
I needed a front man for my company

301
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:04,603
that uses proprietary computer software

302
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,938
to predict market trends.

303
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,374
Of course, I wouldn't let anyone see it,

304
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:10,108
not even him.

305
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:11,577
As long as the predictions were correct,

306
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,379
he didn't care.

307
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:14,613
In fact, he was so grateful,

308
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,650
he constantly wanted to reward me.

309
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,453
And that's when Oliver introduced me

310
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:22,688
to the woman who became Taylor's mother.

311
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,629
Buddy!

312
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:31,129
Meet your new assistant.

313
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:32,130
Assistant?

314
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,132
Hi, Vincent,

315
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,133
it's a pleasure to meet you...

316
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,567
No, no, I don't need an assistant.

317
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:36,669
Oh, yeah. You do.

318
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:38,136
I got a company I gotta pretend to run.

319
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:39,438
No, sorry, I can't...

320
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:40,806
Trust me, all right?

321
00:15:40,841 --> 00:15:42,441
I already told Irene

322
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:43,442
all about how you like to do things.

323
00:15:43,478 --> 00:15:45,311
No cell phones,
portable radios, webcams.

324
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:47,380
No life, no fun...

325
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:49,015
And I completely understand.

326
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,583
Me, I don't like crowds.

327
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:59,458
I-I'm not sure I'll have
anything for you to do.

328
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:00,892
High-maintenance people

329
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:03,162
always think that
they're low maintenance.

330
00:16:03,197 --> 00:16:06,199
You need this, partner.

331
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,135
It wasn't an assistant I needed,

332
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,471
it was human contact...

333
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:16,141
and Oliver must have known that.

334
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,476
You said in our initial session

335
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,511
that your wife died of an aneurysm.

336
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:20,513
Yes.

337
00:16:20,548 --> 00:16:22,314
That was the first time
I was discovered.

338
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,616
Dad?

339
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,284
You know I'm not to be disturbed

340
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,384
when I'm in this room.

341
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,686
Sorry, but Pepper wants out,

342
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,055
and Mr. Morraca isn't around.

343
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:32,791
Well... all right, take her out then.

344
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,226
I'll watch you from here.

345
00:16:34,261 --> 00:16:35,327
Okay.

346
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:36,829
Hi.

347
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:38,865
Hello.

348
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,099
Come on, Pepper.

349
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:42,801
He looks like you.

350
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:44,537
Fortunately for him,

351
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:47,539
he looks like the host
who provided the chromosomes.

352
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,575
Not me.

353
00:16:58,786 --> 00:16:59,785
David Mailer?

354
00:17:00,888 --> 00:17:01,888
Yeah.

355
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,990
I'm your lawyer.

356
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,491
I don't have a lawyer.

357
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,494
Philip Pearson said
you might want my help.

358
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,863
I don't know Philip Pearson.

359
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,564
Friend of Marcy?

360
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,033
Marcy? Oh, my God, yes.

361
00:17:14,068 --> 00:17:15,367
Is she okay?

362
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:16,368
Are you...

363
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:19,104
what are you, like a... FBI lawyer?

364
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,274
Wow. No. No.

365
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:25,177
Jeez, uh,
he said she said you were special,

366
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,746
but I didn't realize you were "special".

367
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,648
Well, this...

368
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:30,783
Sorry, this is...

369
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:32,051
I-I'm not good at this.

370
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:33,352
This is so not my thing.

371
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,222
Well, David,
fortunately this is my thing,

372
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:37,557
and I am very good at this.

373
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:39,758
So...

374
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:43,429
We're probably lookin' 10 years tops,

375
00:17:43,464 --> 00:17:45,798
nine with good behavior.

376
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:48,634
What?

377
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,203
Nah, just screwin' with you.

378
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,907
Why would you... Oh, my God.

379
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:00,446
This isn't how actual
law-enforcement officers

380
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,613
behave, MacLaren.

381
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:04,183
There's giant chunks of time
missing from your logs.

382
00:18:04,218 --> 00:18:05,517
It's a miracle

383
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,053
we didn't catch on to you people sooner.

384
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:08,887
"You people"? What does that mean?

385
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,889
Agent Forbes says,
compared to just a few months ago,

386
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:12,090
you are like a different person...

387
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:14,593
Jesus, take my blood,
take my fingerprints,

388
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:15,961
take whatever you need...

389
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:18,864
who now spends half his time
with a high-school senior,

390
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,932
his counselor,

391
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:21,300
a single mom,

392
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:22,601
a heroin addict,

393
00:18:22,637 --> 00:18:23,668
a farmer, and...

394
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:25,137
this one kills me...

395
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:29,107
a mentally-challenged woman
in the care of the state.

396
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:32,611
Philip Pearson is my C.I.
on a hacking case.

397
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:33,846
We suspected the device

398
00:18:33,881 --> 00:18:36,081
had something do with
hijacking Internet...

399
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:38,150
Let's skip over the part
where you pretend

400
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,918
there's a legit scenario...

401
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,766
Whoever you are

402
00:18:45,801 --> 00:18:49,303
and whoever you work for,

403
00:18:49,338 --> 00:18:52,240
we're on to you now.

404
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:56,677
I'm a single mom.

405
00:18:56,713 --> 00:18:59,581
There's a lot of folks like me.

406
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:03,217
This is going to sound weird,
and possibly insane,

407
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:05,420
but I'm just gonna go ahead and say it.

408
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:07,989
I have a turtle at home,

409
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,623
and I had to leave in a hurry,

410
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:10,825
and there was a lot of broken glass...

411
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
You think this is funny?

412
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,862
No.

413
00:19:14,897 --> 00:19:15,863
I'm just a librarian,

414
00:19:15,899 --> 00:19:17,999
that's all I am.

415
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:19,467
You're more than that.

416
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:31,913
Clamps...

417
00:19:38,121 --> 00:19:39,554
She's fibrillating.

418
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:50,131
Charging, one, two, three.

419
00:19:50,167 --> 00:19:51,466
Clear... shock.

420
00:19:58,274 --> 00:19:59,440
She's stabilizing.

421
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:00,709
There we go.

422
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:06,981
That's not me.

423
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:09,617
It's clearly you.

424
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,688
I have no memory of this.

425
00:20:14,724 --> 00:20:16,791
Don't I get a phone call or something?

426
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,960
Who do you want to call?

427
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,261
My babysitter for one.

428
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:23,298
Jeffrey Jr. is in the hands
of Washington Family Services.

429
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,665
What?

430
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:25,967
Why?

431
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:27,835
No, he needs to be with his mother!

432
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:30,405
God,
how long are you going to keep me here?

433
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,572
Sit back down, please...

434
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:33,508
Permission to break
the hell out of here.

435
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:34,508
I want to see my baby!

436
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:35,509
Sit down!

437
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:36,510
I want to see him now!

438
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:37,511
All right, you call it.

439
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:39,747
I call what?

440
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:41,149
Uh... guys?

441
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:42,516
What are we doing?

442
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:44,152
Let me see it one more time.

443
00:20:46,856 --> 00:20:48,022
On three.

444
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:51,325
Two...

445
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:52,560
I...

446
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,697
One.

447
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:07,508
On the move.

448
00:21:07,543 --> 00:21:09,377
Right behind you.

449
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,819
Do we know what we're doing?

450
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:18,920
Getting out of here.

451
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:31,532
Don't forget Protocol 3.

452
00:21:31,568 --> 00:21:33,500
Don't forget I was ordered to kill you.

453
00:21:33,536 --> 00:21:34,502
Right.

454
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:35,503
This isn't a good time.

455
00:21:35,538 --> 00:21:37,137
Guys?

456
00:21:37,173 --> 00:21:39,774
I think Philip's this way.

457
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,113
I took his legs out.

458
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,147
He went down pretty hard.

459
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:47,248
Marcy?

460
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:51,919
It's probably just a concussion.

461
00:21:51,954 --> 00:21:52,920
He'll live.

462
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:54,522
Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go.

463
00:21:54,557 --> 00:21:55,857
Come on.

464
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,699
Hey!

465
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:25,286
That looked like it hurt.

466
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,520
Well, they didn't try to kill anyone,

467
00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:27,921
so you owe me a buck.

468
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:28,956
What's their progress?

469
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:30,425
Almost to the gym.

470
00:22:31,727 --> 00:22:33,127
All right.

471
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:35,930
Let's see what they do.

472
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:43,204
Boss?

473
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:47,742
Jesus Christ...

474
00:22:47,777 --> 00:22:50,077
That isn't the way out.

475
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:52,680
No. It isn't.

476
00:23:12,369 --> 00:23:15,837
Mac, we gotta go.

477
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:24,379
Go ahead.

478
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:31,319
Didn't think so.

479
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:35,022
Okay,

480
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:36,423
we're here.

481
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,326
Now what?

482
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,002
We were wondering

483
00:23:48,037 --> 00:23:50,104
if you'd really try
to destroy the device,

484
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:51,339
given the opportunity.

485
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:56,310
It seemed odd,
considering you built the thing.

486
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:57,511
Hey, but now that you're here,

487
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,747
maybe you can show us what it does.

488
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:03,517
Under supervision,

489
00:24:03,553 --> 00:24:05,486
obviously.

490
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:07,922
Sorry.

491
00:24:09,893 --> 00:24:12,760
Not gonna happen.

492
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:18,199
Dr. Kravitz,

493
00:24:18,234 --> 00:24:19,734
you have a visitor in the main lobby.

494
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:22,437
Dr. Kravitz,
you have a visitor in the main lobby.

495
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:25,239
Mr. and Mrs. Holden?

496
00:24:25,275 --> 00:24:26,974
Is Trevor okay?

497
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:29,277
He's out of surgery,
and we've stopped the bleeding.

498
00:24:29,312 --> 00:24:32,213
What the hell happened?

499
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:33,447
All I can tell you

500
00:24:33,482 --> 00:24:35,049
is that your son was
involved in a shooting,

501
00:24:35,084 --> 00:24:37,318
and that the bullet we removed
in order to save his life

502
00:24:37,354 --> 00:24:40,387
was lodged dangerously close
to his spinal cord.

503
00:24:40,423 --> 00:24:42,223
There's still
a great deal of inflammation.

504
00:24:42,258 --> 00:24:43,991
Can we see him?

505
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,993
Tomorrow at the earliest.

506
00:24:46,028 --> 00:24:47,061
So he's gonna be okay?

507
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:50,098
I'm confident Trevor will survive this.

508
00:24:50,133 --> 00:24:51,398
He's very strong.

509
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:53,267
But you should know
there's a possibility

510
00:24:53,302 --> 00:24:55,670
he may not regain the use of his legs.

511
00:25:02,311 --> 00:25:05,746
How old was Taylor when his mother died?

512
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:07,382
A baby.

513
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:13,554
I'd spent the latter half
of my life before this one

514
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:15,522
being eaten away

515
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:18,592
by a disease that doesn't exist yet.

516
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:22,096
I never imagined
the possibility of family.

517
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:23,864
A loving wife.

518
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:26,767
A child.

519
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:29,470
Irene was convinced that I'd be angry

520
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:32,406
when she told me about the baby,

521
00:25:32,441 --> 00:25:35,943
afraid I'd think she'd trapped me.

522
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:38,479
But how could she know

523
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:41,048
that in the future I'd left behind,

524
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:43,651
life was so precious...

525
00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:47,054
And new life, so rare,

526
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:49,557
most precious of all.

527
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:52,426
Just as she couldn't have known

528
00:25:52,462 --> 00:25:57,064
that a stolen moment while I slept,

529
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:00,167
a small token of a perfect memory...

530
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:03,704
would be the instrument of her death.

531
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:17,718
An image of me, taken on a cell phone,

532
00:26:17,753 --> 00:26:19,186
time and place recorded,

533
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:21,155
and posted to a friend,

534
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:23,457
discovered and acted upon.

535
00:26:23,492 --> 00:26:24,925
Vincent, I think...

536
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,794
You see, we knew it was possible

537
00:26:26,829 --> 00:26:29,263
to send messages directly to the 21st

538
00:26:29,298 --> 00:26:30,330
through a host,

539
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:32,499
but we projected a 40% chance

540
00:26:32,535 --> 00:26:35,002
that an adult mind
might not be able to withstand

541
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:36,637
the shock of transfer.

542
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:39,840
That's the whole reason
I volunteered to go first!

543
00:26:39,876 --> 00:26:42,176
No one would have to die
that wasn't going to die...

544
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:44,612
Okay, let's just stop...

545
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:45,880
Artificial Intelligence
isn't supposed to be capable

546
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:47,414
of taking a life
that isn't about to end.

547
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:48,482
The Director shouldn't have risked it,

548
00:26:48,517 --> 00:26:49,483
don't you understand?

549
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,685
No!

550
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,655
Not one part of what you just said.

551
00:26:57,193 --> 00:27:00,361
I apologize.

552
00:27:02,899 --> 00:27:04,899
Vincent, I can't help you

553
00:27:04,934 --> 00:27:08,536
if I don't understand
what you're saying.

554
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:10,205
Of course.

555
00:27:23,186 --> 00:27:25,354
Hey, guys...

556
00:27:26,856 --> 00:27:29,324
I just want to say,

557
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,693
whatever happens from this point...

558
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:36,698
be proud of what you accomplished.

559
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:39,901
I still think,
in the grand scheme of things,

560
00:27:39,937 --> 00:27:41,670
we did good.

561
00:27:41,705 --> 00:27:43,672
I know we did.

562
00:27:45,776 --> 00:27:47,842
And I still have faith

563
00:27:47,878 --> 00:27:51,079
the Director will find a way.

564
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:55,283
I believe that with all my heart.

565
00:27:55,318 --> 00:27:56,318
Just...

566
00:27:57,588 --> 00:27:59,655
maybe not with us.

567
00:28:02,592 --> 00:28:04,626
You all know what you have to do.

568
00:28:07,731 --> 00:28:10,299
Boss,
could you be a little more specific?

569
00:28:12,536 --> 00:28:14,769
Self-destruct.

570
00:28:14,805 --> 00:28:16,171
Obviously.

571
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:18,473
What?

572
00:28:18,508 --> 00:28:20,475
In three...

573
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:24,313
Two...

574
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:28,350
One.

575
00:28:45,035 --> 00:28:47,402
Sorry, Wakefield,

576
00:28:47,437 --> 00:28:49,605
you had that coming.

577
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:53,408
Com 3468...

578
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:54,609
disable.

579
00:28:54,644 --> 00:28:56,444
Com 3465, disable.

580
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:57,813
Com 3569,

581
00:28:57,848 --> 00:28:58,813
disable.

582
00:28:58,848 --> 00:29:00,148
3326...

583
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:02,784
disable.

584
00:29:05,722 --> 00:29:08,624
So long, you guys.

585
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:16,598
Well, that's my work day.

586
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,700
Text me if anything happens.

587
00:30:09,052 --> 00:30:11,686
We've gone long past the time
I allotted for this visit.

588
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:13,255
I was wondering
if we could start fresh...

589
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,655
No, I...

590
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:17,159
No, I'd rather you stay a little longer.

591
00:30:20,263 --> 00:30:21,729
Vincent, these delusions...

592
00:30:21,764 --> 00:30:23,465
Memories.

593
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:28,569
Are a very complex product
of severe paranoia.

594
00:30:28,605 --> 00:30:29,571
I can't...

595
00:30:29,606 --> 00:30:30,772
I told you they've found me twice.

596
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:32,240
"They."

597
00:30:32,276 --> 00:30:33,809
The Director.

598
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,013
All right.

599
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:42,183
Tell me about the second time.

600
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:43,618
It was a year later.

601
00:30:43,653 --> 00:30:46,888
The company had become
quite successful...

602
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:48,123
You're not gonna believe
how well that meeting went.

603
00:30:48,158 --> 00:30:49,958
Meeting?

604
00:30:49,993 --> 00:30:51,960
Yeah, with the venture capital company,
I told you.

605
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:53,694
I told you it was a bad idea.

606
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,330
They made an offer.

607
00:30:55,365 --> 00:30:56,897
Now, I didn't commit...
No...

608
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:59,567
because they want your software,
too, but...

609
00:30:59,603 --> 00:31:01,570
No.

610
00:31:02,806 --> 00:31:05,573
$87 million!

611
00:31:05,608 --> 00:31:08,009
Say no again, I dare you.

612
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:09,377
Oliver, I told you from the beginning.

613
00:31:09,413 --> 00:31:11,078
I thought we were
supposed to be partners!

614
00:31:11,114 --> 00:31:12,580
This is my software.

615
00:31:12,616 --> 00:31:13,614
I've told you,

616
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,884
if we affect the market
in any tangible way,

617
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:16,951
it just doesn't work.

618
00:31:16,986 --> 00:31:19,621
Yeah, okay, one, why is that?

619
00:31:19,656 --> 00:31:21,656
And-and two, who cares?

620
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:24,993
If we sell the company for 87 million?

621
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:27,495
I'm not taking "no" for an answer.

622
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,264
You're going to hear them out.

623
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:30,832
Oliver, wait. Wait!

624
00:31:38,942 --> 00:31:42,510
There is no predictive software.

625
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:45,446
It doesn't exist, it never has.

626
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:47,349
All the computers out there,
the software,

627
00:31:47,384 --> 00:31:51,019
it's just for show, it's a front.

628
00:31:51,054 --> 00:31:53,254
Then... how have you...

629
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,357
I'm doing it.

630
00:31:57,694 --> 00:32:01,462
No one could have guessed
large market trends

631
00:32:01,498 --> 00:32:03,164
that accurately and that often.

632
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,299
That's true, I'm not guessing.

633
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:07,368
I'm remembering.

634
00:32:07,404 --> 00:32:10,071
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

635
00:32:10,106 --> 00:32:14,142
It means you can't sell the company,
Oliver, I'm sorry.

636
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:18,446
You can't use that in here...

637
00:32:18,482 --> 00:32:19,714
Yeah, I'm breaking the rules

638
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,649
because you're out of your mind!

639
00:32:21,685 --> 00:32:24,185
If I had stayed silent,
he might have lived,

640
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,188
but the FCC was investigating
the company,

641
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:29,791
and they had tapped his phone.

642
00:32:29,827 --> 00:32:32,894
Voice recognition and GPS
allowed them to find me

643
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:34,562
the moment I spoke...

644
00:32:34,597 --> 00:32:36,298
Oliver, please, I told you.

645
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,232
Stop, please, I told you,
it's dangerous.

646
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:39,434
I said, stop!

647
00:32:47,577 --> 00:32:49,510
Traveler 001,

648
00:32:49,546 --> 00:32:50,745
you are outside mission parameters.

649
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,447
Self-termination required immediately.

650
00:33:13,503 --> 00:33:15,937
First new message.

651
00:33:15,972 --> 00:33:17,739
Walter, it's Kathryn again.

652
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:19,274
I'm at my mother's.

653
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:21,810
Please call me back.

654
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:54,375
Callahan,

655
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,544
any idea what's up?

656
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:58,813
Wakefield just sent me
a message to come here.

657
00:33:58,848 --> 00:34:00,781
Yeah,
most of us all got the same message.

658
00:34:00,817 --> 00:34:01,850
He does this.

659
00:34:13,931 --> 00:34:15,196
Okay, here I am.

660
00:34:15,232 --> 00:34:17,098
What's so important?

661
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:18,266
I was going to ask you the same thing.

662
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:19,333
You just texted me.

663
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:20,902
I what?

664
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:23,338
Yeah, me too.

665
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:57,705
So your business partner
also died of an aneurysm?

666
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,706
Yes.

667
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:01,142
And you became sole owner
of the company.

668
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:02,177
Yes.

669
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:08,115
You think I killed them.

670
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:12,253
I told you, it was the Director.

671
00:35:14,457 --> 00:35:16,858
You have nothing to be afraid of,
Dr. Perrow.

672
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:18,860
I feel so much better

673
00:35:18,895 --> 00:35:22,696
having unpacked myself
of all that baggage.

674
00:35:26,135 --> 00:35:27,969
I feel nothing but gratitude.

675
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:30,838
Great.

676
00:35:30,874 --> 00:35:34,708
Well, if you don't mind,
I'll be, uh, heading home.

677
00:35:34,744 --> 00:35:35,777
My daughter will be wondering...

678
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:37,678
Of course, I've kept you too long.

679
00:35:37,713 --> 00:35:40,582
And your cell phone and payment,
in cash,

680
00:35:40,617 --> 00:35:41,750
is ready outside.

681
00:35:43,654 --> 00:35:45,420
And I'd like to schedule
another appointment, please.

682
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:54,995
Vincent...

683
00:35:55,031 --> 00:35:57,265
you need medication.

684
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,766
I'm not helping.

685
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:01,068
Of course you are.

686
00:36:01,104 --> 00:36:02,804
It doesn't even matter
that you don't believe me.

687
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,140
I get to talk to someone

688
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:10,812
who affords me the privacy
of doctor-client privilege,

689
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:14,115
and you get paid a great deal of money.

690
00:36:14,151 --> 00:36:19,154
It really is the ultimate
21st-Century arrangement.

691
00:36:33,202 --> 00:36:35,002
Grace?

692
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:36,004
Shh!

693
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:37,505
I had to sneak in here.

694
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,240
What are you doing?

695
00:36:39,275 --> 00:36:40,241
I'm sharing

696
00:36:40,276 --> 00:36:41,976
the medical nanites I was given by D-13

697
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,611
so that you'll be able to walk again.

698
00:36:43,646 --> 00:36:44,612
I heard them talking.

699
00:36:44,648 --> 00:36:46,180
Oh.

700
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:47,448
Thank you.

701
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:48,849
You're welcome.

702
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:50,585
It's going to quadruple
my recovery time,

703
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,820
but I suppose you're worth it.

704
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:55,690
So there's no sweet
nanotech for me again?

705
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:57,191
The Director left me out?

706
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:59,860
You've lived longer
than any human in history,

707
00:36:59,895 --> 00:37:01,195
and you're complaining?

708
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,699
I'm starting to take it personally.

709
00:37:09,238 --> 00:37:12,640
Wait, don't medical nanites
need to be programmed

710
00:37:12,676 --> 00:37:14,141
to do specific tasks?

711
00:37:14,177 --> 00:37:16,310
Yes, and I am a...?

712
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:18,312
Programmer.

713
00:37:18,347 --> 00:37:19,814
Oh, yeah.

714
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:22,750
I'm sorry, I'm all drugged up.

715
00:37:22,786 --> 00:37:24,052
I got shot.

716
00:37:25,388 --> 00:37:27,489
I stepped in front of you, remember?

717
00:37:29,426 --> 00:37:31,860
Oh, wow, you did.

718
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:35,028
Thank you for saving me, Grace...

719
00:37:35,064 --> 00:37:36,798
Okay, now shut up and heal.

720
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,767
I need to concentrate.

721
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,913
Walt, I-I thought...

722
00:37:51,948 --> 00:37:54,883
I'm Traveler 4112.

723
00:37:56,452 --> 00:37:58,152
I'm sorry,

724
00:37:58,187 --> 00:38:00,487
I know he was a friend.

725
00:38:00,523 --> 00:38:01,689
How?

726
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:04,892
0014 built the Quantum Frame
with a fail-safe,

727
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:06,427
one that would level
this entire building

728
00:38:06,462 --> 00:38:10,097
the moment Wakefield
and his team opened it up.

729
00:38:10,132 --> 00:38:11,999
Which made all of you host candidates.

730
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:14,202
I heard it happening. How many?

731
00:38:14,237 --> 00:38:16,537
25 of us in the gym,
including Wakefield.

732
00:38:16,573 --> 00:38:17,538
What about the...

733
00:38:17,573 --> 00:38:18,539
The Quantum Frame,

734
00:38:18,574 --> 00:38:21,709
it's being dismantled and scrapped.

735
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,679
So, that's it?

736
00:38:25,782 --> 00:38:27,649
That's it. It's over, Grant.

737
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:32,286
Mac. You call me "Mac."

738
00:38:32,322 --> 00:38:35,589
They shorten everything for some reason.

739
00:38:35,625 --> 00:38:36,590
Mac...

740
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:39,661
I'm gonna need your help
with a lotta things.

741
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,699
Welcome to the 21st.

742
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:08,957
Thank you.

743
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:29,910
Do you really think it's ethical

744
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:31,279
to plant a bomb,

745
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:33,114
and then take over the people
who would have died

746
00:39:33,149 --> 00:39:34,415
when that bomb went off?

747
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:37,084
How is that not circular reasoning?

748
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,320
No way the Director would
allow that level of technology

749
00:39:39,355 --> 00:39:40,687
in the 21st.

750
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:42,456
The Director was the one
who had it ordered built

751
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:43,524
in the first place...

752
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,659
Hey...

753
00:39:44,694 --> 00:39:46,193
a wise man once told me,

754
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:47,227
take the win.

755
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:48,963
Hey.

756
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,466
They wouldn't tell me much,

757
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:52,766
but I got a quick look at the monitors

758
00:39:52,801 --> 00:39:55,102
at the nursing station, and...

759
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:57,171
they're both going to recover.

760
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,843
Well, I'll take that win, too.

761
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:04,445
Come on, everybody, I'll drop you home.

762
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,147
I think I'm gonna stay.

763
00:40:07,183 --> 00:40:09,017
He would.

764
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:20,694
I've decided I'm not gonna kill you.

765
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,964
Oh.

766
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:25,099
Good.

767
00:40:25,135 --> 00:40:27,468
I was gonna ask.

768
00:40:27,503 --> 00:40:28,469
I mean, there must have been

769
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:29,737
some kind of power struggle
back and forth

770
00:40:29,772 --> 00:40:30,939
when all that was goin' down.

771
00:40:33,076 --> 00:40:36,010
Who knows where the order came from,
right?

772
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:38,179
Well, at least it's settled now.

773
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:41,915
Still...

774
00:40:41,951 --> 00:40:44,218
it must have been hard for you.

775
00:40:51,028 --> 00:40:53,062
Thanks for the lift.

776
00:41:07,578 --> 00:41:08,978
David...

777
00:41:10,747 --> 00:41:13,682
It's the middle of the night.

778
00:41:13,717 --> 00:41:16,751
It won't come out.

779
00:41:16,787 --> 00:41:19,254
I mean,
you'd think they'd properly clean up

780
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:20,689
something like this, you know?

781
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:21,723
All those people here,

782
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:25,226
every one of them capable
of holding a mop.

783
00:41:25,262 --> 00:41:26,795
But nah, they're just gonna leave a...

784
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,263
a giant blood stain

785
00:41:28,298 --> 00:41:29,697
and a business card

786
00:41:29,733 --> 00:41:31,266
with the number of a cleaning service.

787
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:33,201
I'm surprised they
took away the dead body.

788
00:41:33,236 --> 00:41:37,105
I'm sorry that
you had to go through that.

789
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,075
He was a John Doe by the way,

790
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,277
which I found fascinating.

791
00:41:42,312 --> 00:41:43,979
Yeah, not just no I.D.,

792
00:41:44,014 --> 00:41:45,147
no record at all.

793
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:49,351
But you probably already knew that.

794
00:41:52,155 --> 00:41:54,889
Ray's a heck of a nice guy.

795
00:41:54,925 --> 00:41:55,891
Here, let me help...

796
00:41:55,926 --> 00:41:57,826
Nah, I got it. I'm trying, uh,

797
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:00,295
I'm trying baking soda.

798
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,764
You know, the good news is,

799
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:04,266
apparently,
the Indian lady that lives next door,

800
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:06,068
whose name I never knew,

801
00:42:06,103 --> 00:42:09,137
told an Officer Boyd,

802
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:11,406
whose name I do remember
for some reason,

803
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:13,775
that the person
that came into her apartment

804
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:19,148
was a stocky bald man
with a thick Canadian accent.

805
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:23,651
Those Canadians, man,

806
00:42:23,687 --> 00:42:25,453
you gotta watch out.

807
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:27,956
But I'm sure you knew all about that,
too.

808
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:28,957
David, here...

809
00:42:28,992 --> 00:42:29,958
David, stop, stop...

810
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:31,326
Now all I have to do

811
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:33,194
is make myself available
for future questioning,

812
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,262
whatever that means.

813
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:35,397
That's good.

814
00:42:35,432 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh, it's wonderful.

815
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:44,806
Can I do anything?

816
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:48,710
Can I make you some tea?

817
00:42:48,745 --> 00:42:51,312
Um...

818
00:42:51,348 --> 00:42:53,114
You know, I've had about 57 cups,

819
00:42:53,149 --> 00:42:56,085
so I'm... I'm a little wired.

820
00:42:59,757 --> 00:43:02,724
What can I do?

821
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,529
This is nice.

822
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,899
Why don't you take the bed tonight,

823
00:43:11,935 --> 00:43:15,503
I'll take the couch, okay?

824
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:18,674
You know, I think I will tonight?

825
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:21,643
I'm really tired.

826
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:23,278
Okay.

827
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:26,414
So, how was work?
