00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:01,459
in the shelter where he sleeps.

171
00:09:01,461 --> 00:09:03,094
Seems like he's been on his own
for a while.

172
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:04,395
You want what's in my head,

173
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:07,131
but there's just so much
that you don't understand.

174
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,700
You might be surprised
what we can understand.

175
00:09:09,702 --> 00:09:11,135
Okay, so you know

176
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:12,603
that an emission of Hawking radiation

177
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:15,406
concerns two mutually
entangled particles?

178
00:09:15,408 --> 00:09:16,806
Who doesn't?

179
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,991
And if that particle enters a black hole,

180
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,478
it emits a finite amount of information,

181
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,778
leaving you with what?

182
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,438
A paradox!

183
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,749
The monogamy of entanglement

184
00:09:26,751 --> 00:09:28,918
requires that the outgoing particle

185
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,653
be fixed inside two independent systems

186
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,305
at the same time!

187
00:09:33,957 --> 00:09:35,324
Definitely upper echelon.

188
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,425
Probably a specialist.

189
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:38,360

a difficult situation?

338
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:34,525
"Have I noticed
a sudden personality change?"

339
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:37,308
"Is she giving away
any personal possessions?"

340
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:40,898
This one here seems to be...
that's more of a statement...

341
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,605
What is this about?

342
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:45,835
Okay, well, I've had
some training in this,

343
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,003
and recently,

344
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,572
I've witnessed some signs
of self-destructive behavior.

345
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:51,362
I'm well aware
of what happened with Marcy,

346
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,208
- if that's what you're asking?
- With the tub and the ice...

347
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,878
I know how that must have looked,

348
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,912
but that wasn't self-destructive,

349
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:57,146
it was experimental.

350
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:58,247
Cutting-edge science...

351
00:18:58,249 --> 00:18:59,248
It was extremely dangerous...

352
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,884
Look, would I have approved? No.

353
00:19:01,886 --> 00:19:04,085
Do I understand why she did it?

354
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:06,212
Yeah, I do.

355
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:07,723
So should you.

356
00:19:07,725 --> 00:19:10,091
[ELEVATOR CHIMES]

357
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,427
Come on.

358
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:17,198
We have some new information.

359
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,099
Simon was one of the first Travelers.

360
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:20,100
004.

361
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:21,569
His mission was to set up

362
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:23,438
our communication infrastructure.

363
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,105
So what happened?

364
00:19:25,107 --> 00:19:28,275
Schizophrenia manifests
itself later in life.

365
00:19:28,277 --> 00:19:30,678
He was sent into a compromised host.

366
00:19:31,781 --> 00:19:33,881
How well do you understand the Internet?

367
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:36,049
I'm good with languages.

368
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,353
Okay, well, broadly speaking,
there are four layers:

369
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:44,558
application, transport,
Internet, and physical.

370
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,461
One of the first things
that Simon did when he arrived

371
00:19:47,463 --> 00:19:51,397
was create a whole new physical layer.

372
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,236
A dedicated backbone that piggybacks

373
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:55,064
off cell phone networks and
communications satellites.

374
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:57,235
Our back channel in the deep web.

375
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,105
Turns out our back
channel also has layers.

376
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:01,874
He's watching you.

377
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,843
Vincent's spying on us there, too.

378
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:05,578
He's using secret layers
in the back channel

379
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,046
for secure communication
and to spy on other travelers.

380
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:09,814
[PHILIP]: That's the bad news.

381
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:10,949
The good news is, now that we know,

382
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,550
we think we can use it against him

383
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:13,904
to find out where he's hiding.

384
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:16,921
Show me.

385
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,570
He presented very classically:

386
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,106
persecutory delusions,

387
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,740
fear of authority and surveillance...

388
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,776
The neuroleptics leveled him out,

389
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:31,130
and we've been working on
the other stuff ever since.

390
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,882
He believes he was sent from the future

391
00:20:34,884 --> 00:20:36,889
on a mission to save the Earth.

392
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:39,652
He literally doesn't think
he's living in his own body.

393
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:49,690
The art therapy has been
a successful intervention.

394
00:20:49,964 --> 00:20:52,165
As you know, he's a natural talent.

395
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:02,369
Simon, you have a visitor.

396
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:05,677
This is the man I was telling you about.

397
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,946
Hello, Simon.

398
00:21:07,948 --> 00:21:09,581
It's a pleasure to meet you.

399
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:21,680
Dr. Carroll...

400
00:21:24,597 --> 00:21:25,563
would it be possible

401
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:26,830
for me to speak with Simon alone?

402
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:28,098
You wouldn't be in any danger,

403
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,599
if that's what you're worried about.

404
00:21:29,601 --> 00:21:31,401
[VINCENT]: I'd like
to talk about his work

405
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,836
and I want him to feel free to open up.

406
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,863
Well, I suppose I could go
grab us some coffees.

407
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,145
Simon, will you be nice to our visitor?

408
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:45,704
Mr. Ingram is a close friend
of the institution.

409
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:52,795
You're not supposed to be here.

410
00:21:53,357 --> 00:21:55,191
Simon, you heard what Dr. Carroll said.

411
00:21:55,193 --> 00:21:57,591
You were supposed to die
in the North Tower.

412
00:22:00,565 --> 00:22:01,963
You know who I am.

413
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:03,639
I know that voice,

414
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,067
we searched for it for years.

415
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:07,368
Then you also know

416
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,571
that I'm important to the program, Simon.

417
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,173
I'm the very first traveler.

418
00:22:12,175 --> 00:22:13,908
The Director is not happy.

419
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,320
You were supposed to die.

420
00:22:15,322 --> 00:22:16,544
Not anymore.

421
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,213
The Director gave me a new mission.

422
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:20,947
What mission?

423
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:22,849
The Director feels terrible
for what happened to you

424
00:22:22,851 --> 00:22:23,850
and wants to fix it.

425
00:22:23,852 --> 00:22:26,620
It sent me to help you.

426
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:31,492
We're going to make you
whole again, Simon.

427
00:22:35,863 --> 00:22:36,862
[PHILIP]: <i>There are
16 continental switches</i>

428
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:38,164
on the back channel,

429
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,898
but only four that handle
sub-channel traffic.

430
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,400
Simon helped me set up alerts

431
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:43,369
to log any suspicious network activity.

432
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:44,737
So what are we looking at?

433
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:45,871
[PHILIP]: This is Vincent

434
00:22:45,873 --> 00:22:47,394
communicating
with somebody late last night.

435
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:49,576
- With who?
- We don't know.

436
00:22:50,245 --> 00:22:51,719
What does it say?

437
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:52,877
We don't know that either...

438
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:54,346
So where's it going?

439
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:55,647
[TREVOR]: We don't know
where it was sent or received.

440
00:22:55,649 --> 00:22:57,915
Hops are encrypted along the sub-channels

441
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:59,900
as well as at both ends of the pipe.

442
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,492
Except for this one.

443
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:03,911
He's getting a call.

444
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:05,178
Well, grab it.

445
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,080
[TREVOR]: It looks like
the access point is unsecure.

446
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:08,715
We might be getting a phone number...

447
00:23:08,717 --> 00:23:10,149
[PHONE RINGING]

448
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:17,323
This isn't the last phone I sent you.

449
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:20,493
Those phones are meant for
your safety as well as mine.

450
00:23:20,495 --> 00:23:21,928
[DR. PERROW]: <i>I can't find that one.</i>

451
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,929
<i>This won't take long.</i>

452
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:25,230
Vincent, you need

453
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:27,332
a more thorough treatment regimen,

454
00:23:27,334 --> 00:23:30,669
one that at least allows for
the possibility of medication.

455
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:33,338
No. I don't need drugs,
I just need to talk!

456
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,441
We have an appointment.

457
00:23:34,443 --> 00:23:35,707
And I'm calling to cancel it.

458
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:36,875
That is unacceptable.

459
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:38,109
<i>Vincent, I'm sorry.</i>

460
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:39,210
I can recommend...

461
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:40,846
<i>No. I don't want to talk
with anyone else,</i>

462
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,447
I just want to talk with you!

463
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:44,548
And I will, just as we agreed!

464
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,616
<i>Goodbye, Vincent.</i>

465
00:23:45,618 --> 00:23:47,618
Please don't contact me again.

466
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:53,277
[TREVOR]: Call's over.

467
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:55,433
We got the originating number.

468
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,627
Good.

469
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:57,761
I've gotta get back to the Bureau.

470
00:23:57,763 --> 00:23:58,762
You track down that location.

471
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:00,197
Everybody else, Protocol 5.

472
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:01,898
The minute we find out
where Vincent is hiding,

473
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,266
we're going to knock down
his goddamn door.

474
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:06,936
Hey, Carly, hold up.

475
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:08,138
What?

476
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:11,574
I was thinking maybe you could stay.

477
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,142
For?

478
00:24:13,144 --> 00:24:14,878
Protection?

479
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,605
I gotta pee.

480
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:21,216
I think you got this.

481
00:24:21,218 --> 00:24:22,317
Bye, Philip!

482
00:24:25,956 --> 00:24:27,589
Oh, Mr. Ingram?

483
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,224
Mr. Ingram.

484
00:24:29,226 --> 00:24:31,259
I'm so glad I caught you.

485
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,494
I just wanted to thank you

486
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,929
for the personal interest
you've taken in Simon's care.

487
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,168
Oh, I'm happy to help.

488
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,432
But I'd also like to talk to you

489
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:40,453
about all the equipment
you've been bringing in...

490
00:24:40,455 --> 00:24:41,617
Surplus electronic parts

491
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:42,837
from my various companies.

492
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,672
Most of it isn't even functional.

493
00:24:44,674 --> 00:24:47,141
Still, Simon's convinced

494
00:24:47,143 --> 00:24:50,912
it will help
with his "consciousness issue".

495
00:24:50,914 --> 00:24:52,436
Is that what he's saying now?

496
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:53,980
Of course, the problem is,

497
00:24:53,982 --> 00:24:56,115
we have procedure to follow...

498
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:57,483
Safety and compliance,

499
00:24:57,485 --> 00:24:58,785
various approval committees...

500
00:24:58,787 --> 00:24:59,953
I understand.

00:34:25,676 --> 00:34:27,418
[TREVOR]: Fancy part of town.

670
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,044
Right, which made this next part easier.

671
00:34:30,046 --> 00:34:31,346
Most people who live in this area

672
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:32,710
are upstanding citizens

673
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,449
who have actual names
attached to their phones.

674
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:37,600
Narrow the search to nameless devices...

675
00:34:37,787 --> 00:34:39,754
and our list drops close to zero.

676
00:34:40,232 --> 00:34:41,192
Simon and I spent the night

677
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:43,557
checking security footage
at these locations

678
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,359
and came up with our prime suspect...

679
00:34:45,361 --> 00:34:46,868
Katrina Perrow:

680
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,047
specializes in treating panic disorders,

681
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:51,799
social anxiety and agoraphobia.

682
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,033
Text me the address.

683
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:54,467
Carly, you're with me.

684
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,827
Yup.

685
00:34:56,237 --> 00:34:57,236
[VINCENT]:<i> You've been given</i>

686
00:34:57,238 --> 00:34:58,237
<i>every resource to make this work!</i>

687
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:00,206
[SIMON]: We need more time.

688
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:02,790
We need to be operating
at the exascale, minimum.

689
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:05,507
- The meteor will...
- [VINCENT]: I told you... I told you...

690
00:35:05,509 --> 00:35:07,414
I keep telling you...

691
00:35:07,416 --> 00:35:09,752
the meteor doesn't happen for years.

692
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:12,117
Then we find another way, right?

693
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,127
Look, we've got the node clusters,

694
00:35:14,129 --> 00:35:15,391
the math libraries,

695
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,389
we just need a qubit engine
and a field generator...

696
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:18,390
Where are we going to get that, Simon?

697
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:20,292
- The Director!
- Oh!

698
00:35:20,294 --> 00:35:22,072
- This was a mistake.
- No...

699
00:35:22,074 --> 00:35:24,403
- I've wasted so much time...
- No, we just need the plans.

700
00:35:24,405 --> 00:35:25,763
No. We're finished here.

701
00:35:25,765 --> 00:35:27,609
We've hurt so many people!

702
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,499
We hurt Marcy!

703
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:34,324
Just ask the Director for the materials!

704
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:37,174
Ask the Director!

705
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:14,142
[PHILIP]: Why didn't
the Director help him?

706
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,311
Afterwards, I mean?

707
00:36:16,313 --> 00:36:17,784
Why'd it abandon him?

708
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:22,316
Probably for the same reason
it sent my consciousness...

709
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:23,985
yours, too, for that matter...

710
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:26,287
into a compromised host...

711
00:36:26,289 --> 00:36:27,455
it didn't know.

712
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:29,557
No records from the institution

713
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,025
made it out of the 21st.

714
00:36:31,895 --> 00:36:33,466
Vincent covered his tracks.

715
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:36,697
[SIMON]: I want to go home.

716
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:38,263
What's that?

717
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:41,558
Can I go home now?

718
00:36:44,407 --> 00:36:45,506
Can I ask about...

719
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:46,507
No.

720
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,232
Dr. Perrow?

721
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,046
I'm Special Agent Grant MacLaren,

722
00:36:53,048 --> 00:36:54,714
and this is my associate, Carly Shannon.

723
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:57,365
We'd like to speak to you
about one of your patients.

724
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:02,422
The FBI has been monitoring
Vincent Ingram for some time.

725
00:37:02,424 --> 00:37:04,356
[CARLY]: We know all about
his paranoid delusions,

726
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:07,125
and, unfortunately,
he's starting to act on them.

727
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:08,327
[DR. PERROW]: He's hurt someone.

728
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:10,169
[MACLAREN]: Yes, and we believe
it will continue.

729
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:12,230
I didn't know.

730
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,231
I would have reported it.

731
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:14,499
None of that matters now.

732
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:16,593
We're just interested in stopping him.

733
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:19,270
Our professional relationship
deteriorated.

734
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:22,053
I just called him
to cancel an appointment.

735
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:23,174
We're aware of your phone call.

736
00:37:23,176 --> 00:37:24,910
We want you to keep that appointment.

737
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:26,445
What?

738
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:27,882
Why?

739
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:29,439
Ingram is in hiding.

740
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,216
You want me to keep my appointment

741
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,018
and you're going to follow me?

742
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,286
We have a device.

743
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,022
It's completely untraceable,

744
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:40,909
but it will allow us to be
in constant communication.

745
00:37:41,753 --> 00:37:42,752
You mean like a wire?

746
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:44,661
[MACLAREN]: Little more
high-tech than that.

747
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,789
Will you help us?

748
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:51,290
I just got out of a board meeting,

749
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:53,792
and they told me that
you are withdrawing funding.

750
00:37:53,794 --> 00:37:55,494
I told them that this must be
some kind of mistake.

751
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:57,029
It's not a mistake.

752
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:58,697
At least give us more time.

753
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:01,000
A more gradual reduction
of funds would allow us to...

754
00:38:01,002 --> 00:38:03,035
I'm sorry, I've made my decision.

755
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:05,304
The institute has come
to rely on your generosity.

756
00:38:05,306 --> 00:38:07,769
Whole programs will be shuttered.

757
00:38:08,441 --> 00:38:09,812
And what about the patients?

758
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:11,910
A lot of them will be put
out on the street.

759
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:14,745
Well, then it's fortunate
you care so much

760
00:38:14,747 --> 00:38:16,959
and I've been able
to compensate you so well

761
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,516
over the years.

762
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:20,948
You can take my place as a benefactor.

763
00:38:33,899 --> 00:38:34,998
All right.

764
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,534
This should be enough
to last you for a while.

765
00:38:37,536 --> 00:38:38,735
Give us a call when you need more,

766
00:38:38,737 --> 00:38:40,426
you know how to find us.

767
00:38:42,573 --> 00:38:44,180
I'm glad it worked, Marcy.

768
00:38:45,176 --> 00:38:46,108
Glad what worked?

769
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:51,020
The device in room 21C.

770
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:54,883
I thought you were gone forever,

771
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:55,884
but then you got better.

772
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:00,721
Maybe I can get better, too.

773
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,627
Okay. Take care of yourself, okay?

774
00:39:20,142 --> 00:39:21,775
[CAR ENGINE STARTS]

775
00:39:29,651 --> 00:39:31,618
[PHILIP]: <i>Okay, the car's
approaching now.</i>

776
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,052
<i>Good luck.</i>

777
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:06,517
All right, she's leaving the city.

778
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:08,019
Signal looks good.

779
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,022
[TREVOR]: Yeah. We see that, too.

780
00:40:11,024 --> 00:40:12,727
Following at a safe distance.

781
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,070
[CARLY]: <i>Dr. Perrow,
you activated your com.</i>

782
00:40:27,072 --> 00:40:28,071
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

783
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:29,072
It's fine.

784
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:30,806
[CARLY]: We're right behind you.

785
00:40:30,808 --> 00:40:32,075
All you need to do is lead us there

786
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:33,498
and we'll do the rest.

787
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,172
It's a fine day out there.

[MACLAREN]: There it is.

790
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:29,429
[TREVOR]: GPS says she's inside.

791
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:30,763
[CARLY]: I was going to say

792
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:31,897
we need to deactivate the cameras,

793
00:41:31,899 --> 00:41:33,641
but I don't see any.

794
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:36,561
In fact, I don't even think
this barn has any power.

795
00:41:37,037 --> 00:41:39,405
Makes sense if you want to hide
from the Director.

796
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:42,108
Why do these things
always end up in barns?

797
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,926
