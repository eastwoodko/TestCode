1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,200
Previously, on Travelers...

2
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,636
She uploaded a command while
pretending to save Marcy's life.

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,371
You mean you used me.

4
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,106
I have filed a recommendation

5
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,774
for his father to take custody.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,242
Jacqueline, please!

7
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,578
It's not safe.

8
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,046
Pack a bag, go to your mother's
for a few days, maybe a week.

9
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,047
Okay, here I am.

10
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,083
What's so important?

11
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,289
I'm Traveler 4112.

12
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,291
The Quantum Frame, it's being scrapped.

13
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:27,892
I'm gonna need your help
with a lot of things.

14
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,194
Welcome to the 21st.

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,041
I am so sorry.

16
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,977
How could he be offering
a Whistler chalet,

17
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:21,346
a Tuscan villa,
and a Caribbean hideaway,

18
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,916
all for $20,000?

19
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,819
I've gotta be honest...
I'm wondering the same thing.

20
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:28,987
Look, I've been doing this a while,

21
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,123
and I have never seen a deal like this!

22
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,192
So which property
appeals to you the most?

23
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:36,461
Maybe the Caribbean hideaway?

24
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,630
Don't we all
wish we were there right now?

25
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,865
But seven to ten days a year?

26
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,734
That's, like, $2,000 a day.

27
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,735
Yeah!

28
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,504
If you go once!

29
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,339
It's a lifestyle.

30
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:50,074
Isn't that what you were interested in,
Dale?

31
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,976
Yeah... I said that.

32
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,311
But that was after you said

33
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,679
this would only take 90 minutes

34
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,848
and we'd get a free dinner
at House of Rib.

35
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:58,717
90 minutes...

36
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:01,653
No, I hear you.

37
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,759
All right...

38
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,227
I don't know how I'm gonna do it,

39
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,729
but let me go talk to my manager,

40
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,630
and see if we can do better.

41
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:14,066
Give me five.

42
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,535
When I come back,

43
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,104
you'll have a whole new perspective.

44
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,799
Kat!

45
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,934
I thought you said the danger was over.

46
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,135
It is.

47
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:25,637
Then why are you holding a gun?

48
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,505
You didn't call me back.

49
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,774
I thought you were still
at your mother's.

50
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,109
Why didn't you say something
when you came in the house?

51
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,577
I expected you to be at work!

52
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:34,546
I've been up all night.

53
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:35,613
I'm sorry if...

54
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,981
Doesn't matter,
I'm just glad you're home.

55
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,650
I'm not home. I'm just here

56
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:39,985
to get a few things.

57
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,121
I know the last couple of days
have been insane.

58
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,691
You know,
I must have left a dozen messages.

59
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46,824
Until I got yours

60
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,127
at 4:00 this morning,

61
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:50,928
I thought for sure you were dead.

62
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,697
That's all over now.

63
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,732
What's over?

64
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,933
Tell me.

65
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,801
You know I can't talk about my work.

66
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,071
You've never said my life was in danger!

67
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,110
Because of my work,
I was targeted by a... a group.

68
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,478
And I was afraid, by association,

69
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,813
you might be in danger, too.

70
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,215
It's not the case,
they're no longer a threat.

71
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,451
That's all I can say.

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,187
How do I even know that's true?

73
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:17,822
You're obviously capable of lying to me.

74
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,357
Please stay and talk.
I'll make breakfast.

75
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,093
No, I'm not gonna do that.

76
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,528
Kat! Hey.

77
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,831
What? Are you planning on supervising?

78
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,233
What do you want from me?

79
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,501
I don't want anything from you, Grant.

80
00:04:30,537 --> 00:04:32,337
Not a single thing.

81
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:48,253
David?

82
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,988
Hey!

83
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,422
I made pancakes.

84
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,691
You probably don't remember

85
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:53,758
what pancakes are,

86
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,361
but I happen to know
that you like them a lot.

87
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,697
What's wrong?

88
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,899
Uh, nothing, just, uh...

89
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:03,568
You used to sleep naked when we met,

90
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,404
and I thought maybe you...

91
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:07,906
Nope.

92
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,941
False alarm.

93
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,480
How long you been up?

94
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:16,948
Oh, since, uh...

95
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,784
All night.

96
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,320
I was thinking of maybe
watching some TV,

97
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,490
but then you were all wrapped up cozy

98
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,191
on the... On the couch,

99
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,494
and I didn't want to wake you, so, um...

100
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,363
then I, uh...

101
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,396
then I...

102
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:33,898
Hey, you know what?

103
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,234
Let's switch things up
and-and you sit here,

104
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,437
'cause I'm always sitting on this side.

105
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,939
Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

106
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,040
Thanks.

107
00:05:44,912 --> 00:05:47,045
Good.

108
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:51,115
Are you okay?

109
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,584
Hmm?

110
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,019
Sure!

111
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:57,288
I don't know.

112
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,390
No.

113
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,726
I mean, a strange man died

114
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,729
right across from where
I eat my cereal every morning,

115
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:07,098
and I'm just having a hard time dealing.

116
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,099
David, he was gonna kill you.

117
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,467
That doesn't help.

118
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:10,901
I was the one that he was looking for.

119
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,970
Well, that definitely doesn't...

120
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,439
David, it's over.

121
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,341
You're safe.

122
00:06:19,313 --> 00:06:21,246
Well, you know that...

123
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,182
does make me feel a little bit better.

124
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,419
I thought your parents
were never gonna leave.

125
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,487
They're just worried about me.

126
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,456
Yeah, but the doctor said

127
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,057
it's just temporary, right?

128
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,692
From the swelling?

129
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,027
Does it hurt?

130
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:37,461
No.

131
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,997
You really can't feel anything?

132
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,131
Uh-uh.

133
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,633
Nothing?

134
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,669
No.

135
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,506
What about this?

136
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:49,841
Whoa.

137
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,309
Rene...

138
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,545
The nurse could walk back in any minute.

139
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,779
You can feel that?

140
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,114
Rene...

141
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,150
Please... Please.

142
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,820
I'm still in recovery. I should rest.

143
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,622
I shouldn't get too excited.

144
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:07,592
Okay... babe. You rest.

145
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,962
I'll see you tomorrow...

146
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:13,331
and the next day...

147
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,900
and the next.

148
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,040
Do I seriously have to listen to that

149
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,041
tomorrow

150
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,843
and the next day and the next?

151
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,346
I almost pressed the call button

152
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,015
because I thought I was
gonna throw up my lunch.

153
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,717
She's very young.

154
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,352
You're very old.

155
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,987
I can't argue with that.

156
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,722
You really don't feel anything yet?

157
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,390
I mean, the amount of medical nanites

158
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,391
I gave you

159
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,459
was barely above the minimum threshold,

160
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,028
but I thought you'd have
some sensation by now.

161
00:07:44,064 --> 00:07:46,998
With age comes patience.

162
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,399
How are you feeling?

163
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,901
Like I could walk out of here,

164
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,369
but I'll have to fake it for a while,

165
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,437
or they'll think I'm a medical miracle.

166
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,672
Mm!

167
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,241
Besides, I love the food in here.

168
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,577
It's amazing! Right?

169
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,388
Carly...

170
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,857
Carly!

171
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,057
What do you want?

172
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,960
How about you answer your phone?

173
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:18,029
I'm not here to creep,

174
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,029
just to say thanks.

175
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,098
You can thank your Sergeant.

176
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,232
He's the one that made me
give the statement.

177
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,400
Oh, I did.

178
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,970
Listen, I'm just as upset
about Jeffrey Jr. as you.

179
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,440
I'm not even allowed to see him, Jeff!

180
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,542
No contact.

181
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:31,977
Me neither.

182
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,914
You didn't know?

183
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:46,024
Hey, partner.

184
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,893
Everything all right?

185
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:51,395
I just went into the wrong bathroom.

186
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,498
Back to basic training for you.

187
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,066
What's this?

188
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,768
Missing persons report.

189
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:59,237
Doesn't missing persons fall
under local law enforcement?

190
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,939
We come in if there's
an interstate component.

191
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,040
Right.

192
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,774
All six failed to check
out of the same hotel.

193
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,676
Left all their belongings.

194
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:07,478
"Serenity Inn and Suites."

195
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,682
So... So I guess we have to go there.

196
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,250
Yeah.

197
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,918
We're FBI agents.

198
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,820
Badges and everything.

199
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,788
All right, but, uh...

200
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,391
can you drive?

201
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,826
You just need practice.

202
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,063
Who'd like to start?

203
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:32,336
Hi. My name is Philip...
and I'm an addict.

204
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,938
Hi, Philip.

205
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,641
You know, the hardest part about this

206
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,643
is admitting to yourself
that you're not strong enough.

207
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,280
Uh, that you can't just stop...

208
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,882
even when you know
what it's doing to you.

209
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,685
I was doing really well, I was...

210
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,722
and then I lost somebody close to me.

211
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,292
Technically, not, uh, "lost" lost,

212
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,729
she's still in my life,
but she's just...

213
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,499
This is impossible to explain.

214
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,169
I feel like she's gone.

215
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:07,105
At least, a part of her is.

216
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,376
Anyway...

217
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,044
I miss her.

218
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,013
Thank you, Philip.

219
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,850
Who'd like to go next?

220
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:32,397
Hi.

221
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,267
I'm sorry about your friend.

222
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,504
Thanks.

223
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:42,374
We need all the support we can get,
right?

224
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,281
I'm Traveler 4514.

225
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:55,153
The Director assigned me to help you.

226
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,593
You're right.

227
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,896
A little fresh air is nice.

228
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,732
It's important not to get fixated.

229
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,434
Was I fixated?

230
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,437
Yeah, I was.

231
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:14,105
It's normal to be rattled by trauma.

232
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,306
You just want to make sure

233
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,108
it doesn't tip into
something more serious.

234
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,876
Like what?

235
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,112
Here, let's sit.

236
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,617
Jesus.

237
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,385
I think you're experiencing

238
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,522
early symptoms of PTSD.

239
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,090
That's ridiculous.

240
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,593
Soldiers in battle get PTSD.

241
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,760
First responders
of horrible disasters...

242
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:37,761
Heightened anxiety,

243
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,797
inability to sleep,

244
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:42,000
exaggerated startle response.

245
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,636
Exaggerated star...
You just made that one up!

246
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,138
I'm fine!

247
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,909
I mean, technically,
it's too early to diagnose,

248
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,578
but early treatment won't hurt
and it should help, so...

249
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,147
Here. Come here.

250
00:11:58,618 --> 00:12:01,319
Give me your hands.

251
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,455
I want you to close your eyes.

252
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,123
I want you to think about
what happened to you

253
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,359
while you focus on my tapping... okay?

254
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,665
Seriously? Is this a real thing?

255
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,101
'Cause it-it feels a little bullshitty.

256
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,143
Uh, you know what? I'm sorry. I, uh...

257
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,880
Could we just keep walking?

258
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,650
Yeah. Good idea.

259
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:35,987
You know what?

260
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,355
I'm gonna head back to the apartment.

261
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,256
I'll meet you back there.

262
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,725
Where are you going?

263
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,794
To get something that'll help.

264
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,065
Okay.

265
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:57,308
So your mission is to help me?

266
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,646
Specifically to... give you this.

267
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,282
Eye drops?

268
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,683
Synthetic compound.

269
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,886
To help with the heroin addiction.

270
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,688
It's invented 20 years or so from now.

271
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:14,124
Naloxone, buprenorphine...

272
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,360
and some other things

273
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,195
that are even harder to pronounce.

274
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,965
But... it will stop the craving

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,333
and curb your withdrawal.

276
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,034
And I'm just getting this now?

277
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,537
Hey, I-I know you were trying hard,

278
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,806
but then you had the setback

279
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:30,207
when you got captured, they gave you...

280
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,643
How'd you know about that?

281
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,879
The future.

282
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,815
Maybe the Director figured
you'd quit on your own

283
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,118
and you couldn't do it.

284
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,731
There. See?

285
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:54,732
It's perfectly...

286
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,577
That wasn't funny.

287
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,079
Yes, it was.

288
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,219
One drop per eye, as needed.

289
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,624
Jenny, by the way.

290
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,575
These are amazing.

291
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:39,877
Yep.

292
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,112
Now what do I do?

293
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:42,814
Whatever you want.

294
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:47,051
What are you gonna do?

295
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,023
You had a simulator?

296
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,692
Wow. Okay.

297
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,727
Uh, just loosen up on the wheel,

298
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,296
and try to get out of your head.

299
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,431
You know, sing a song or something.

300
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,434
Doesn't have to be a song.

301
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,469
Just recite something you know by heart.

302
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,037
Uh, list the protocols.

303
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,074
Uh, Protocol 1. Uh...

304
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,776
Mission comes first.

305
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,744
Uh, two, leave the future in the past.

306
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,712
Now, let's turn up here.

307
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,747
Protocol 3...

308
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,048
Don't take a life, don't save a life,

309
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,050
unless otherwise directed.

310
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,117
Good.

311
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,319
Protocol 4, uh, don't reproduce.

312
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,421
Don't reproduce.

313
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,336
I don't know how the hell
you got to work today.

314
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,605
Uh, just like that.

315
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,772
Yeah, well, Protocol 2

316
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:43,741
isn't gonna get you out of practicing.

317
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:44,842
Hold on a sec.

318
00:15:44,878 --> 00:15:45,910
Kat?

319
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,945
You're right. We should talk.

320
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,079
Great. Uh...

321
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,281
Come by the house tonight.

322
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,282
I'll make...

323
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,783
I'm staying at Nicole's
while she's away.

324
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,185
I'll text you the address.

325
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,487
Sure. Want me to bring anyth...?

326
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,562
Carly, they took away our son.

327
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,064
We need to be on the same side.

328
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,532
You charged me with assault,

329
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,102
blocked me from getting a job,

330
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,669
told the judge I was an unfit mother.

331
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,505
You have every right to be pissed at me,

332
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,606
but I did those things

333
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,774
because I was pissed at you.

334
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,577
So how about we stop being
pissed at each other,

335
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:22,380
and see what happens?

336
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,883
When I saw the girl about to shoot you,

337
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,119
I just felt...

338
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:35,226
I can't imagine what I'd do
if I lost you for good.

339
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,496
Yeah,
I guess I never did thank you for that.

340
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,231
Mm, well, you still haven't.

341
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:43,301
Thank you.

342
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,369
You're welcome.

343
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:58,149
So walk us through what happened.

344
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,984
The seminar was going great.

345
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,852
I had two buyers on the hook.

346
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,087
Maybe three!

347
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,254
And then I...

348
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,023
I left the room near the end,

349
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,058
to go get my manager.

350
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,392
We usually offer a slightly better deal

351
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,428
to really drive it home.

352
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,428
Sure.

353
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,598
Except when I came back,
20 minutes later,

354
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:14,999
they were gone.

355
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,867
20 minutes?

356
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,736
It's a sales technique...

357
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,072
Just let 'em stew on it a little bit.

358
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,674
Guess it wasn't such a great deal.

359
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,111
Can you show us the security footage?

360
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,518
Marce?

361
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,888
Hey. My key isn't working.

362
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,795
Hi.

363
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,364
Hey.

364
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:49,199
I stopped by the hardware store
on the way home,

365
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,935
and it turns out
they were having a big...

366
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,872
sale on locks.

367
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,008
Yay, "safety."

368
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,079
Why don't you have a seat?

369
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,618
Now,
we only use this for training purposes.

370
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:08,919
We don't care.

371
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:09,987
Right.

372
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,589
Can I have one of these?

373
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,125
Sure, yeah, but they're a day old.

374
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,895
Press play, please.

375
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:41,518
You didn't tamper with this, did you?

376
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,020
No. No, I swear.

377
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,521
You can stop swearing.

378
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,156
Did you have more plans for the group?

379
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:48,292
We were gonna shuttle them
to our sister location

380
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,993
to pick up their free dinner vouchers.

381
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,195
In the shuttle bus outside?

382
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:52,429
Yeah. Yeah, why?

383
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,132
Might want to get your brakes checked.

384
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,673
What is this?

385
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,208
This is an eye-movement therapy kit

386
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,343
to treat PTSD.

387
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,480
All right.

388
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,816
Follow the light with your eyes.

389
00:19:12,852 --> 00:19:13,817
I want you to think

390
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:14,885
about what you were doing

391
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:17,788
moments before the man arrived.

392
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,991
I was washing dishes.

393
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,261
Concentrate on how you felt.

394
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,697
What happened next?

395
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,167
Drying the dishes.

396
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,677
I-I don't see how this is supp...

397
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:43,046
This is part of
the desensitization process.

398
00:19:43,082 --> 00:19:46,083
Give me your hands.

399
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,586
Close your eyes.

400
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,755
All right.

401
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:06,704
He forced his way in.

402
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:07,905
How did you feel when that happened?

403
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,885
He kept hitting me.

404
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,557
David... David... David!

405
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,960
No!

406
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,629
David.

407
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:32,897
I'm right here.

408
00:20:32,932 --> 00:20:34,531
Hey. Look at me. Hey!

409
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,367
You're fine. I am right here.

410
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,968
Okay?

411
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,104
You're fine. You're fine.

412
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,144
Let's concentrate on
one mystery at a time,

413
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,412
shall we?

414
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:52,917
New arrivals cause
static on video cameras,

415
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,086
so it's pretty obvious
that it's six new Travelers.

416
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,455
With a total disregard for Protocol 5.

417
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,990
Maybe they're working on mission.

418
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,925
Let's be sure. In the meantime,

419
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,661
we bury any connection to this hotel.

420
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,162
Philip, are you there?

421
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,229
Yeah, go ahead.

422
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,231
I'm leaving what looks like

423
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,766
the scene of a mass arrival...

424
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,234
Six people in a hotel conference room.

425
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,468
Do you remember anything about

426
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,103
a group of travelers
arriving today in Bellingham?

427
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:14,938
Uh, how were they supposed to die?

428
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,773
I'm just guessing, but something

429
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,842
with a shuttle bus.

430
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:18,909
Brake failure, maybe?

431
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,976
Nothing like that today,

432
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,578
but you know the timeline's
been changing.

433
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,314
Yeah. Or maybe they went missing

434
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,649
for a different reason.

435
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,185
What, you mean like how we went missing?

436
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,620
Let's hope not.

437
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,422
I'll keep on it.

438
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,490
Sorry about that.

439
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,625
Oh, must be a relief.

440
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:36,860
What?

441
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,996
If you're seeing changes
in the timeline,

442
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,131
it'll mean you won't have
to carry the burden

443
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,234
of knowing everyone who's about to die.

444
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,969
Maybe eventually.

445
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:46,971
It's amazing how little has changed

446
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:49,407
considering everything we've done.

447
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,011
I know what happened
with Aleksander Andreiko.

448
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:56,213
Maybe we shouldn't
be talking about that.

449
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,881
Hey, I agree with what you did.

450
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,649
You saved that kid's life.

451
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,952
You know the Director isn't perfect.

452
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,421
We definitely shouldn't
be talking about that.

453
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,523
Don't forget. We created it.

454
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,827
The Director might not
be able to break rules,

455
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,862
but we can.

456
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,667
What?

457
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:19,303
I feel like I'm waiting
to be struck by lightning.

458
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,907
Not a black cloud in the sky.

459
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:37,354
Come on.

460
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,691
Where are we going?

461
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,760
It's a surprise.

462
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,034
Is that any better?

463
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,069
I have no idea.

464
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:55,539
I have another, different treatment.

465
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,109
Can it be later?

466
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,745
Sure.

467
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,585
Although, sometimes,

468
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,254
medicine is the best medicine.

469
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,290
Cannabis is known to help
with symptoms of...

470
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,559
Absolutely, it's known to.

471
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,629
You need to inhale the smoke.

472
00:23:18,664 --> 00:23:20,931
Oh, I'm familiar with the process.

473
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,746
You know,
it's excellent for memory loss, too.

474
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,430
Hey.

475
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,232
Hi.

476
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,268
Come in.

477
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,571
Wow. This is nice.

478
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,607
You've been here before.

479
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:06,009
We helped her move in.

480
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,311
Right. Right.

481
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,580
All I remember is boxes.

482
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,384
What are you doing?

483
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,589
Opening some wine.

484
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,963
So, how long's Nicole away?

485
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:30,267
All year. She's on sabbatical.

486
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,641
What's that?

487
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:39,710
Separation papers.

488
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,312
They have to be filed...

489
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,847
Wait, wait, wait. You...

490
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:45,549
You're talking divorce?

491
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,518
You broke your vows, Grant.

492
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:48,685
And I told you,

493
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:49,720
it's the worst mistake I ever m...

494
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,055
Shit.

495
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,656
No, don't touch it.

496
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,259
I'm sorry.

497
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,563
You're bleeding.

498
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,198
Yeah.

499
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:03,834
I'll get it.

500
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,069
Do you have any...?

501
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,338
Yeah, yeah. In the bathroom.

502
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,874
Everything all right?

503
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,711
I got to go.

504
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,981
No, not before you sign these,
Grant. I...

505
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,221
Thank you.

506
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,457
Are you okay?

507
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,333
Trevor? Are you asleep?

508
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:13,270
Uh... I was.

509
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:15,738
I was dreaming.

510
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,441
About what?

511
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:20,777
I was walking in the park.

512
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,747
I don't dream much.

513
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,749
I can tell.

514
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:29,319
Sorry. I shouldn't have woken you.

515
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,320
I'm just used to being able

516
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:31,454
to have intelligent conversations

517
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,789
24/7.

518
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,726
I thought you weren't
much of a people person.

519
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,927
Who said that?

520
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,862
Ellis.

521
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,864
Oh.

522
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,567
He was right, actually,

523
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,335
but I was talking about the Director.

524
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:48,338
Lamenting those conversations
are over now.

525
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,505
I talked to the Director

526
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,007
a few times.

527
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,343
I talked to it endlessly.

528
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,980
I don't know what to do with myself.

529
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,982
Protocol 5. You can counsel children.

530
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:02,486
Please, I said intelligent conversation.

531
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:04,488
So you miss the Director?

532
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,290
Huh.

533
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,660
I think I do.

534
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,895
Interesting.

535
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,232
You miss her, don't you?

536
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,603
I can tell by the way you look at me.

537
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,738
What you see is my realization

538
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,373
that, instead of saving Grace's life,

539
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,943
I made her last few hours terrifying.

540
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,479
I guess I've cheated death for so long,

541
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:29,646
I thought that I could do the same

542
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,581
for somebody else.

543
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,116
But I've lived long
enough to know better.

544
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,651
Well, try to understand

545
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,020
that the faction had already
corrupted the Director.

546
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,521
The grand plan was in jeopardy.

547
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,556
I understand.

548
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,538
Ladies and gentlemen...

549
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,407
please give a warm welcome
to our speaker for this evening,

550
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,142
Dr. Edwin Calloway!

551
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,916
You can't be serious.

552
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:08,951
Edwin Calloway?

553
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,154
Do you know how much hatred

554
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,755
and intolerance this guy inspires?

555
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,056
Immigration...

556
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,092
is the true test of a nation,

557
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,796
because the nation needs to be
strong enough to survive it.

558
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,432
Too much accommodation...

559
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,267
This guy is a racist dick.

560
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,402
I am not watching this.

561
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,770
Shh. Just wait.

562
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,639
How many people here today feel like

563
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,808
this country is headed
in the right direction?

564
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,243
And how many feel like

565
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,946
their cultures and traditions
are being respected

566
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,583
by the people they suddenly find

567
00:28:39,618 --> 00:28:42,753
taking their jobs,
dating their daughters?

568
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,291
Well, there's a reason
you all feel this way...

569
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,895
Their cultures
don't respect your culture.

570
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:57,734
That's a mistake.

571
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,470
All right. Shut it off.

572
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:01,538
Shut it off!

573
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,274
Shut it off!

574
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,414
You did that?

575
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,484
Still not struck by lightning.

576
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:24,961
Here.

577
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:26,964
No, thanks. I feel fine.

578
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:29,833
Yeah, but do you want to feel amazing?

579
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,410
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

580
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,451
Protocol 4, right?

581
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:31,628
What was I saying?

582
00:30:33,465 --> 00:30:34,931
Uh...

583
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:37,067
that you should sell the apartment?

584
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:38,569
Right.

585
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:42,171
Although,
I think you got to say if someone died,

586
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:43,774
you know, on the disclosure form.

587
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,641
Just...

588
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,911
Re-stain the floors
and nobody needs to know.

589
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,612
See?

590
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,081
That's why

591
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,150
you're an FBI doctor.

592
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,254
Who am I kidding?

593
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:01,625
I can't sell this place.

594
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,760
All my stuff's here.

595
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:06,396
Oh, man.

596
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,966
I'm really feeling this.

597
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,437
I don't feel anything.

598
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,613
Hey, Mac?

599
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:23,613
Whatever it is,

600
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,116
try figuring it out on your own.

601
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:29,086
I just did. Come on, check this out.

602
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:35,125
Two of our missing people were
just flagged in Sacramento.

603
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Local PD got 'em
for running a red light.

604
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,295
"Dale Miller"

605
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,963
and "Meredith Gilroy."

606
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,131
Looks like they don't
know how to drive either.

607
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,467
I suggested that these two

608
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,535
were just having an affair.

609
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,869
What about the others?

610
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,971
Technically?

611
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:49,539
No longer under our jurisdiction.

612
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,175
Local PD took it back.

613
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,511
There's hope for you yet.

614
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,721
Hey.

615
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,990
What is this?

616
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,025
I got a present for you.

617
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,426
Wow.

618
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,662
Looks great.

619
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,798
It, uh, it even covers up the...

620
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,634
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

621
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,903
I got you a present, too.

622
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,470
Yay, safety.

623
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:23,973
I'm not gonna be needing those.

624
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,076
I'm not staying.

625
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,310
What?

626
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,078
You can continue
the therapy on your own,

627
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,347
as you feel you need it.

628
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,915
But I can already tell
that you're getting better.

629
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,385
W-When did you decide this?

630
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,721
I was told my living here
was always temporary.

631
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,224
You can't just buy me
a goodbye rug and then...

632
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,525
David...

633
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:44,360
you went through a traumatic experience.

634
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,496
Yeah, I'm feeling another one coming on.

635
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,064
Well,
just keep up with the treatments...

636
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,433
Don't talk to me like I'm a patient.

637
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,768
I'm responsible for what happened.

638
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,439
You said we were safe.

639
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,940
You are, but...

640
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,407
you'll be safer without me.

641
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,176
How is that even possible?

642
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,211
You're the one who saved me.

643
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:02,546
And look at the result.

644
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:06,116
I mean, your anxiety
may never completely go away.

645
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,418
I did that to you.

646
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,062
You asked before if we were intimate,
and...

647
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:22,832
I didn't know what to say because,
I mean...

648
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,534
Well, I don't know,
because I'm an idiot.

649
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:27,570
What I should have said was, yes.

650
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,606
We were intimate.

651
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,043
I love you, Marcy.

652
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:36,980
And you love me.
You just don't remember.

653
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,918
You're right.

654
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:43,887
I don't.

655
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,090
But I do care about you.

656
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,164
Enough to leave.

657
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,977
I understand this is a difficult time

658
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:09,512
for both of you.

659
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,048
But the 72-hour
dependency action was filed

660
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,650
and Jeffrey Jr.
will be in the care of the state

661
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:16,186
until the next assessment.

662
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,087
That's why we're here.

663
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:19,189
We need to see him.

664
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,890
Not until the next hearing.

665
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,158
I'm sorry.

666
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,528
Trust that he's in a good home.

667
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,761
I'm his father!

668
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,096
I have a right to see my son.

669
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:28,798
The action was filed
for Jeffrey's safety.

670
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,167
By who?

671
00:34:31,837 --> 00:34:33,536
It was you, wasn't it?

672
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:37,039
When we received information
regarding the police incident...

673
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,041
Okay. Hold on.

674
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,609
I was cleared of all charges...

675
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,177
I called you, Mr. Conniker,

676
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,046
and we spoke at length,

677
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,383
but I understand why you may
forget the conversation.

678
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:52,856
We also tried unsuccessfully
to contact you, Ms. Shannon.

679
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,026
So what do we do?

680
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:58,228
Based on your current behavior
and your history...

681
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,331
I think it might be time to consider

682
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:04,967
allowing another guardian
to take care of Jeffrey.

683
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,169
Indefinitely.

684
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,671
I'm not gonna give my son
over to some stranger.

685
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,907
Unless things radically change,

686
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,845
that is going to remain
Jeffrey Jr.'s best option.

687
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:19,149
Philip?

688
00:35:19,184 --> 00:35:20,149
Yeah!

689
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,219
Just one minute!

690
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:25,221
Who are you?

691
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,490
This is Jenny.

692
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:29,091
Hi.

693
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,727
Hello.

694
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:32,596
Philip, can I talk to you for a second?

695
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,581
Did you bring a 21st-er to Ops?

696
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,917
Well, actually, she's a Traveler.

697
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:56,019
And that's better how?

698
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:58,087
So I'm gonna go.

699
00:35:58,123 --> 00:35:59,456
Good idea.

700
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,325
Talk to you later?

701
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,429
What's going on?

702
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,964
I'm clean, Marcy.

703
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,032
That's how we met.

704
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,600
The Director sent her to help me.

705
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:16,272
A synthesized drug
to help me get off heroin.

706
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,773
I need to know

707
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:19,242
what this is made of.

708
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:20,409
Naloxone, buprenorphine,

709
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,245
and some other things.

710
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,346
What other things?

711
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,648
I don't care. It works!

712
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,117
My body doesn't hurt when I'm not high.

713
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:28,251
I get to have a normal life.

714
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,786
There's nothing normal about this!

715
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,322
Why?

716
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,792
Because I met someone?

717
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:39,596
You have somebody.

718
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:41,831
Not anymore.

719
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,433
I'm gonna stay here for a while,

720
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,069
until I find my own place.

721
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,938
Of course.

722
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:51,641
This place is yours, too.

723
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:52,842
You okay?

724
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,079
I'm fine.

725
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,886
Mr. Holden.

726
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,020
Mr. Doc.

727
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,688
What's the prognosis?

728
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,356
Still a lot of inflammation.

729
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,925
Do you feel anything yet?

730
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,727
Even pins and needles?

731
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,062
I think so.

732
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,364
It's hard to say.

733
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,666
Well... let's, uh, do the test again.

734
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,502
Ow!

735
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:21,103
Oh, I felt that.

736
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,771
And movement. That is excellent.

737
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,240
Excellent!

738
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:25,842
Does this mean...?
It means there's hope!

739
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,744
Wow.

740
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,678
Thank you so much.

741
00:37:29,714 --> 00:37:32,015
Would you like me to contact your folks?

742
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,149
I-I would like that very much, yes,

743
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:34,417
because they'll want to thank you, too.

744
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,352
I'll check in again later
before I go today,

745
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,353
but how about one of these, buddy?

746
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,354
All right.

747
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,597
Hope?

748
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:50,533
There are medical nanites
designed in the future

749
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,502
swimming through your spinal fluid

750
00:37:52,537 --> 00:37:54,470
that I programmed personally,
repairing the damage.

751
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:55,805
There was never any doubt.

752
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:58,541
Well, I wanted him to feel good
about the job that they did.

753
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,310
Well, I want them to bring breakfast.

754
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:01,978
They're half an hour late already,

755
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:03,946
and I'm starving.

756
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,448
Thank you for saving me, Grace.

757
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,449
You already said that.

758
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,664
Hi.

759
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,700
Come on in.

760
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,784
Carly, what're you doing?

761
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:15,885
What do you think?

762
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,186
You're not gonna find anything.

763
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,187
I told you,

764
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,022
I stopped drinking. This is for real.

765
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,324
No, Jeff.

766
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,992
This is for show.

767
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,562
And you better not screw it up...

768
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,698
because this is our one chance
to get Jeffrey back.

769
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,734
Don't worry. It's gonna work.

770
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,169
The big question is,

771
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,873
where do I put my, uh, stuff?

772
00:39:41,446 --> 00:39:43,446
By the couch.

773
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,652
Hey, um, you hungry?

774
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:52,088
I was thinking...

775
00:40:11,276 --> 00:40:12,909
She's not here, is she?

776
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:15,845
The bitchy little blonde?

777
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,380
"Marcy"

778
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,248
is out looking for an apartment.

779
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:21,584
That's why I texted.

780
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,219
You seen this?

781
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:26,923
His followers went nuts on him,

782
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,290
and then, this morning,

783
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:30,927
he woke up, shot his wife and his kid,

784
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,395
before he killed himself.

785
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,863
Philip, I know...
His wife and child

786
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,531
Are dead and it's our fault.

787
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,899
You mean my fault.

788
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,200
I mean this is fucked up, Jenny!

789
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,036
No. It really isn't.

790
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:41,037
None of this would've happened

791
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,171
if you hadn't hacked his presentation.

792
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,940
He probably would've
gone on spewing hate

793
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:48,377
that led to the deaths
of hundreds of people.

794
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,046
Thousands!

795
00:40:50,081 --> 00:40:51,581
You tell me, you're the historian.

796
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,049
It's not up to us.

797
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,283
I didn't tell him

798
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,684
to kill his family.

799
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,986
All I did

800
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:59,389
was tell the truth.

801
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:02,224
And his wife and child?

802
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,093
The world is a better place

803
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,761
without Edwin Calloway.

804
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,762
And I'm sorry,

805
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,430
maybe he took some innocent people

806
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,432
down with him,

807
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,667
but I refuse to feel guilty about it.

808
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:14,169
Yeah, well, the Director's gonna know.

809
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,006
If the Director thought
what we were doing was wrong,

810
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,942
why didn't I get a messenger?

811
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,313
Orders from another team to back off?

812
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,582
Can you look me in the eye and tell me

813
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:28,718
what I did was not a good thing?

814
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,672
Kat.

815
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:51,774
Grant, what are you doing here?

816
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,342
You can't just show up here.

817
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,144
Kat. I know.

818
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,145
What?

819
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,648
That you're pregnant.

820
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:01,784
What? Did you show your badge
to my obstetrician?

821
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,118
No.

822
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,287
Can I come in?

823
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:09,726
I saw your supplements in the bathroom.

824
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:12,161
You went through my things?

825
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,162
Yes, I did,

826
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,363
and you can give me shit for that

827
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,364
after we talk.

828
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,532
I am not doing that.

829
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,434
Yes, you are.

830
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,037
Kat!

831
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,705
It happened the night
of your surprise party,

832
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,375
the one time we made love
in the past four months.

833
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,442
I just found out.

834
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:31,914
I haven't even decided
to go through with it yet.

835
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:34,050
It was hard enough before,

836
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:35,351
when I knew how you felt about me.

837
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,385
You do know how I feel about...

838
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,453
And if I decide not to,

839
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:40,957
I won't have you standing there
judging me.

840
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:45,861
This is something we wanted
more than anything.

841
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:49,332
It's my decision to make,
and I'm gonna do it on my own.

842
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,770
You should go.

843
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:14,456
So, the Tuscan villa,
the Whistler chalet,

844
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:16,725
and the Caribbean hideaway...

845
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,527
Three stunning properties

846
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:22,832
all for the price of two
or three normal vacations.

847
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,470
All right.

848
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:31,040
I can tell you need
a little more motivation.

849
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:32,474
I'll go see if my manager

850
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,077
can knock a few dollars
off the purchase price.

851
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,146
I'll be right back.
